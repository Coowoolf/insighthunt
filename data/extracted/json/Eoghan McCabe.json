    "background": "Eoghan McCabe is the co-founder and CEO of Intercom, a customer service platform. He successfully navigated a high-stakes turnaround of the late-stage SaaS company by pivoting aggressively to an AI-first, agent-based model, reversing stagnation and achieving massive growth.",
    "background_zh": "Eoghan McCabe 是客户服务平台 Intercom 的联合创始人兼 CEO。通过大刀阔斧地向 AI First 和 Agent-based 模式转型，他成功带领这家成熟期 SaaS 公司完成了一场高风险的战略翻盘，不仅彻底扭转了业务停滞的颓势，更实现了爆发式增长。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Eoghan McCabe details the aggressive, high-risk transformation of Intercom from a plateauing legacy SaaS business to a hyper-growth AI agent company. He discusses the necessity of 'Founder Mode'—using top-down, authoritarian decision-making to force cultural resets, rewrite values, and execute bold pricing strategies. The conversation explores the existential threat AI poses to SaaS, the mechanics of outcome-based pricing for AI agents, and the psychological toll of radical corporate restructuring.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To pivot a late-stage company to AI, you must be willing to dismantle existing revenue streams and cultural norms; incrementalism fails against existential disruption.",
    "Pricing for AI agents should be outcome-based (e.g., per resolution) rather than seat-based, aligning 100% with the value delivered to the customer.",
    "Cultural values should act as a 'sharp knife' designed to cut people out who don't fit, rather than generic statements of inclusion.",
    "In times of crisis or massive pivot, seek 'Founder Mode' (unilateral, brave decision-making) over consensus or democratic management.",
    "The future of organizations is a hybrid of humans and agents, where humans will likely move into 'manager' roles overseeing agentic outputs.",
    "Efficiency is not the only value metric; humans will continue to pay a premium for connection, story, and craft even as agents commoditize execution.",
    "Deeply question 'best practices' from the previous SaaS era; young AI companies are winning by ignoring them and working with extreme intensity."
