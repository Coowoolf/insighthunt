    "title": "Former GM of Consumer Product at Twitter",
    "company": "Twitter / Periscope",
    "background": "Kayvon was the longest-tenured Head of Product at Twitter and GM of the consumer business until the Elon Musk acquisition. He co-founded Periscope, the pioneering live-streaming app acquired by Twitter, and led major product initiatives like Spaces, Communities, and Twitter Blue.",
    "background_zh": "Kayvon 曾是 Twitter 任职时间最长的产品负责人及消费者业务总经理，直到 Elon Musk 收购该司。他是直播应用鼻祖 Periscope 的联合创始人（后被 Twitter 收购），在 Twitter 期间主导了 Spaces、Communities 和 Twitter Blue 等核心产品的发布。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Kayvon Beykpour opens up about the chaotic transition during Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, his firing during paternity leave, and the massive cultural overhaul he led to transform Twitter from a stagnant organization into a shipping machine. He discusses the strategy of using 'acqui-hires' to bypass bureaucracy, the pitfalls of over-relying on frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done, and the hard lessons learned from the rise and fall of Periscope.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Kayvon Beykpour 揭秘了 Elon Musk 接管 Twitter 期间的混乱过渡，以及他在陪产假期间被解雇的经历。他深入探讨了如何通过文化重塑，将 Twitter 从一个停滞不前的组织转变为高效交付的团队。对话涵盖了利用“人才并购”绕过大公司官僚主义的策略、过度依赖 Jobs-to-be-Done 等框架的陷阱，以及从 Periscope 兴衰中汲取的深刻教训。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Identify 'sacred cows' in your product (things people say you can't change) and make them your roadmap to signal cultural change.",
    "Use 'acqui-hires' to bring in founder-level energy and shield them in silos to launch risky bets like Spaces and Birdwatch.",
    "Frameworks like OKRs and Jobs-to-be-Done can lead to user-hostile products if not balanced with strong product taste.",
    "Standalone consumer apps for specific features (like live video) often fail due to retention; they usually work better as features within a larger platform.",
    "Refining the core product often drives the most growth, but neglecting big bets leads to stagnation and lack of ambition.",
    "Staff risky projects with 'believers' rather than just available resources to ensure the resilience needed to survive internal skepticism."
