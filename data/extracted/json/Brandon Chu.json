  "episodeSummary": "Brandon Chu, VP of Product at Shopify, discusses the unique product culture at Shopify, emphasizing their 'digital by default' approach and the importance of 'founder skills' for PMs. He explores the nuances of Platform Product Management, specifically the need to stack-rank constituents. The conversation also covers his philosophy on decision-making velocity, the career-accelerating power of writing, and how Shopify uses 'Bursts' to maintain connection in a remote-first world.",
