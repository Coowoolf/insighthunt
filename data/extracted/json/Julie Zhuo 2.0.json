  "episodeSummary": "Julie Zhuo discusses the evolution of product management and design in the AI era, advocating for a shift from specialized roles to a 'Builder' mindset. She explores how to balance data intuition with creative design, manages the psychology of rapid change using the 'Willow Tree' metaphor, and shares timeless leadership advice on feedback and self-management.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Julie Zhuo 探讨了 AI 时代产品管理和设计的演变，倡导从专业化角色向“构建者（Builder）”思维转变。她深入剖析了如何平衡数据直觉与创造性设计，提出了用“柳树”隐喻来管理快速变革中的心理状态，并分享了关于反馈和自我管理的经典领导力建议。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The era of rigid roles (PM, Designer, Engineer) is fading; AI enables everyone to be a generalist 'Builder'.",
    "Diagnose with data, but treat with design—data reveals the problem, not the solution.",
    "Fast-growing startups often lack rigorous data infrastructure and rely on 'vibes', but eventually need observability when growth slows.",
    "Effective management in the AI era requires being like a 'Willow Tree': sturdy in vision/values but flexible in execution.",
    "View skills as 'dimensionality': every strength can be a weakness depending on the context.",
    "Feedback is a mechanism to calibrate your perception against reality; establish a high-trust relationship before delivering it."
