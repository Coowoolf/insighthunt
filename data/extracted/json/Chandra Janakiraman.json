  "episodeSummary": "Chandra Janakiraman dismantles the myth that strategic ability is an innate 'gene' and presents a rigorous, battle-tested playbook for creating product strategy. He distinguishes between 'Small S' strategy (solving problems over a 2-year horizon) and 'Big S' strategy (aspirational vision over 5-10 years), offering a step-by-step guide involving cross-functional working groups, design sprints, and rigorous problem framing.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Strategy sits between Mission/Vision and the Plan (Roadmap); its primary function is to force choice on scarce resources.",
    "Use the 'Fruit Story' approach with leadership: Ask stakeholders what 'fruit' (outcome) they want before you start building, rather than guessing and disappointing them.",
    "A 'Small S' strategy typically takes 8-12 weeks to formulate and guides the product for 18-24 months.",
    "Limit your strategy to exactly three 'Strategic Pillars' and explicitly list what you are NOT doing.",
    "Ranking criteria for strategic bets: Expected Impact, Certainty of Impact, Clarity of Levers, and Uniqueness (can we do this better than anyone else?).",
    "Use 'Mock Strategies' generated by AI to get a comprehensive list of potential investments, then apply human judgment to down-select.",
    "Strategy is worthless until tested by execution; be willing to pivot if the 'Resonance' isn't there (as seen in the Portal vs. Quest example)."

        "**Phase 3: The Design Sprint (1 Week):** Do not design features. Instead, generate 'Illustrative Concepts'—visual artifacts that bring the strategic pillars to life so stakeholders can 'see' the strategy.",
        "**Phase 4: Writing & Rollout:** The PM writes the narrative solo (1-2 weeks), weaving the inputs together. Roll out via small 'Roadshows' (8-10 people) to ensure high-fidelity communication."
