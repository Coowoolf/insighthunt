    "title": "Hypergrowth Advisor & Former Head of Marketing",
    "company": "Atlassian (Former), Advisor to Miro, 1Password, Segment",
    "background": "Carilu Dietrich is a veteran marketing executive best known for leading marketing at Atlassian through their IPO. She now advises CEOs and CMOs of hypergrowth B2B companies like Miro, Bill.com, and 1Password on scaling from $30M to $500M+ ARR.",
    "background_zh": "Carilu Dietrich 是一位资深市场营销高管，因带领 Atlassian 市场团队成功完成 IPO 而闻名业内。她目前担任 Miro、Bill.com 和 1Password 等超高速增长 B2B 企业的 CEO 及 CMO 顾问，指导企业实现 ARR 从 3000 万美元到 5 亿美元以上的规模化扩张。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Carilu Dietrich dissects the mechanics of hypergrowth, drawing on her experience taking Atlassian to IPO without a traditional sales team. She outlines frameworks for career acceleration to the C-suite, the specific metrics used to identify winning companies, and the nuances of layering sales onto a Product-Led Growth (PLG) motion. The episode also covers the friction points between Product and Marketing and how to resolve them using the 'Amazon Press Release' method.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To achieve hypergrowth, you cannot rely solely on paid acquisition; organic, inbound, and viral word-of-mouth are mathematical necessities.",
    "When evaluating a company to join, look for Net Dollar Retention (NDR) ideally above 120-140% as a primary signal of product health.",
    "In PLG, do not bundle products for the 'Land' motion; bundling slows down self-service evaluation. Use bundling only for expansion and retention.",
    "Delay hiring sales hunters as long as possible; instead, use sales teams initially for renewals and enterprise assistance rather than cold prospecting.",
    "Aspiring executives must shift their language from functional metrics (e.g., leads, traffic) to financial and board-level metrics (e.g., revenue, CAC, Rule of 40).",
    "Hypergrowth companies 'skip' stages (e.g., jumping from 50 to 100 employees quickly), requiring the hiring of '2X or 3X leaders' who have already seen the next two stages of growth.",
    "Marketing and Product friction often stems from handing over a 'bag of doorknobs' features; writing the press release *before* building aligns the narrative."
