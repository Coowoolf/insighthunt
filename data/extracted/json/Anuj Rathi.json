    "title": "Chief Product and Marketing Officer",
    "company": "Jupiter Money",
    "background": "A veteran product leader in the Indian tech ecosystem, Anuj was the first Product Manager at Flipkart and spent seven years scaling Swiggy as SVP of Revenue & Growth. He specializes in building high-frequency marketplaces and designing for the unique complexities of the diverse Indian consumer base."
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Anuj Rathi deconstructs the unique challenges of building products for the Indian market, advocating for a 'full-stack' approach where PMs act as influencers across the entire business. He details rigorous frameworks for product strategy, including a user psychology model based on laziness and vanity, and a 'Four BBs' portfolio approach to prioritization. The conversation challenges conventional wisdom on speed vs. excellence and offers a blueprint for navigating complex, three-sided marketplaces.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "**Adopt the 'Full-Stack' PM Mindset:** PMs must be 'full-stack influencers,' treating internal stakeholders (engineering, ops, legal) and users with the same level of persuasion strategy. You are in the business of influence, not just feature shipping.",
    "**Diagnose Failure with the 'Not Set Up To Do' Lens:** When a team member fails, assess if it is a capability issue ('can't do'), a motivation issue ('won't do'), or an org design issue ('not set up to do'). Leaders often overlook the third, which accounts for 70-80% of failures.",
    "**Replace OKRs with 'Big Bets' in Complex Marketplaces:** In three-sided marketplaces (e.g., customer, driver, restaurant), OKRs often fail because goals are inherently conflicting (e.g., increasing driver earnings vs. lowering customer fees). Use narrative-driven 'Big Bets' to manage these trade-offs holistically.",
    "**Prioritize Excellence Over Speed:** Contrary to the 'move fast and break things' ethos, prioritize excellence. Most experiments should be filtered out by meta-thinking before they ever reach code; shipping half-baked products to 'lazy, vain' users destroys trust.",
    "**Use 'Show Don't Tell' for Alignment:** Instead of abstract requirements, create a physical or digital wall mapping the exact user journey pixel-by-pixel alongside real-time operational constraints (e.g., what is the driver doing while the user waits?). This aligns marketing, ops, and product instantly.",
    "**Recruit for 'Raw Sharps' and 'Drive':** When hiring PMs, look for three traits: Raw Sharps (problem identification/solving), Drive (grit/curiosity), and Influence (the ability to move others without authority)."

      "category": "user-research",
      "problemItSolves": "Overcomes the 'curse of knowledge' where product teams assume users care about the product, read instructions, or have patience.",
      "summary": "A psychological framework for designing onboarding and core interactions. It posits that the modern consumer has zero patience (Lazy), cares about their image/habits (Vain), and focuses solely on personal gain (Selfish).",
      "principles": [
        "**Lazy:** Assume the user has no time. Design for zero cognitive load; do not make them 'figure it out.'",
        "**Vain:** Respect existing habits. If you ask a user to change a behavior, the status payoff must be massive.",
        "**Selfish:** Frame every piece of copy and interaction around 'What's in it for me?' immediately. Connect marketing promises directly to the first screen they see."
      ],
      "whenToUse": "During the design of new user onboarding flows, marketing copy creation, and top-of-funnel optimization.",
      "commonMistakes": "Listing features instead of benefits; assuming users are 'looking' for an app to download (their time is already allocated).",
      "quote": "You have to think about users on modern internet consumers having three attributes. So they are lazy, they are vain, and they're selfish.",
      "realWorldExample": "At Swiggy, instead of a generic welcome, they ensured the specific promotion (e.g., '200 rupees off') that triggered the download was the very first thing the user saw upon opening the app, catering to the 'selfish' need immediately."

        "**Big Bets:** Large, cross-functional initiatives that require Working Backwards documents and executive alignment.",

      "whenToUse": "Annual or quarterly strategic planning to decide resource allocation percentages.",
      "commonMistakes": "Allowing 'Bread and Butter' to consume 100% of capacity; failing to explicitly agree that increasing investment in 'Breaking Bad' requires accepting more bugs in 'Bread and Butter.'",
      "quote": "If I gave you a hundred focus points, how much will you put in each of these buckets?",
      "realWorldExample": "When Swiggy launched Instamart (Breaking Bad), they had to explicitly agree to invest less in the core food delivery app tweaks (Bread and Butter) and accept potential short-term stability risks (Brilliant Basics) to fund the pivot."

      "realWorldExample": "When designing a loyalty program, rather than just pitching 'Gold/Silver' tiers, the team would write one PR for a tier-based system, one for a points-based shop, and one for a flat subscription model to compare the narratives."
