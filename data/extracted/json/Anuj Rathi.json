      "summary": "A framework derived from Scott Belsky that posits modern internet consumers possess three inherent attributes: they are Lazy (no time/patience), Vain (driven by ego/habit/social standing), and Selfish (need immediate 'what's in it for me'). Product onboarding and marketing must solve for these to capture attention.",
      "principles": [
        "Lazy: Users will not spend time figuring out your UI; reduce friction to zero.",
        "Vain: Users have existing habits and egos; the product must make them look good or fit their identity.",
        "Selfish: Users don't care about your features; they care about their own benefit immediately."

      "whenToUse": "During the design of new user onboarding, marketing copy, and the 'first mile' of product experience.",
      "commonMistakes": "Assuming the user is interested, willing to read manuals, or willing to change their habits without immediate reward.",
      "quote": "You have to think about users on modern internet consumers having three attributes. So they are lazy, they are vain, and they're selfish.",
