    "company": "Retool",
    "background": "Eeke is a product leader who spent six years at Stripe, starting as one of their first employees and PMs where she helped build foundational products like Stripe Connect and Radar. She now leads product at Retool, bringing deep expertise in scaling technical products and high-performance cultures.",
    "background_zh": "Eeke 曾在 Stripe 任职六年，作为早期核心成员及首批 PM，一手打造了 Stripe Connect 和 Radar 等基石级产品。目前她担任 Retool 产品负责人，在技术产品规模化扩张及打造高绩效文化方面拥有深厚造诣。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Eeke de Milliano dissects the tension between process and innovation, arguing that while process reduces variance, it often stifles the highest performers. She shares actionable frameworks for scaling Stripe-like cultures, including how to structure 'crazy ideas' into launched products, how to build a diversified talent portfolio rather than hiring clones, and why companies should aim for a 'Minimum Viable Process.'",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat process as a variance reduction tool: use it to raise the floor, but provide escape hatches so you don't lower the ceiling for high performers.",
    "Implement a 'Crazy Ideas' annual ritual where the prompt is specifically for ideas that have a 90% chance of failing but a 10x-100x return if they succeed.",
    "Utilize the 70/20/10 resource allocation model: 70% core product (including maintenance), 20% strategic non-core initiatives, and 10% pure speculative bets.",
    "When building MVPs, 'build the scooter, not the axle.' Ensure the smallest version is functional end-to-end rather than a component of a larger dream.",
    "Stop hiring in your own image; audit your team every six months to identify gaps in your 'Talent Portfolio' (e.g., visionaries vs. executors) and hire specifically for those missing traits.",
    "Use the 'Trapdoor' decision framework: Pricing is rarely a trapdoor (you can grandfather users), but titles are (hard to revoke).",
    "For technical products, build for your best user first, not your worst user. Don't let fear of abuse cripple the initial product definition."
