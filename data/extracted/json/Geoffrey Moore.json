  "episodeSummary": "Geoffrey Moore revisits his seminal framework on technology adoption, explaining why many founders still fail to cross the 'chasm' between early adopters and the early majority. He details the specific playbooks for each stage of a company's lifecycle—from finding a beachhead market to navigating the 'tornado' of mass adoption—and warns against common pitfalls like broad targeting and premature discounting.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Geoffrey Moore 重温了他关于技术采用周期的经典框架，解释了为什么许多创始人仍然无法跨越早期采用者和早期大众之间的“鸿沟”。他详细介绍了公司生命周期各个阶段的具体打法——从寻找滩头阵地到驾驭大规模采用的“龙卷风”期——并针对目标泛化和过早打折等常见误区发出了警告。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Startups must secure a 'marquee customer' to put them on the map before attempting to cross the chasm.",
    "To cross the chasm, focus on a niche segment that is 'big enough to matter, small enough to lead'.",
    "Visionaries want 'projects' and future tech; Pragmatists want 'solutions' and peer references.",
    "Do not confuse a 'compelling reason to sell' (your features) with a 'compelling reason to buy' (their pain).",
    "Different market stages require contradictory playbooks; using a Tornado playbook in the Bowling Alley phase will kill your company.",
    "Avoid discounting during the chasm crossing; price based on the value of solving a critical problem.",
    "For B2B, the target market must be defined by geography, industry, and profession to ensure peer references work."
