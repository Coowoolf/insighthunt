    "background": "The legendary founder of Lexicon Branding, responsible for naming iconic products and companies including BlackBerry, Pentium, Swiffer, Sonos, Azure, Vercel, and the Impossible Burger. He pioneered the use of linguistics and sound symbolism in commercial naming."
  },
  "episodeSummary": "David Placek demystifies the black box of product naming, transforming it from a creative guessing game into a rigorous science combining linguistics, cognitive psychology, and strategy. He challenges the common desire for 'comfortable' names, arguing that distinctiveness requires discomfort and friction. The episode details Lexicon's proprietary three-step process, specific exercises for founders to define their 'win' state, and the hidden power of sound symbolism in influencing consumer behavior.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Comfort is the enemy of a great name; if your team is immediately comfortable with a name, it is likely too descriptive and safe.",
    "Polarization is a signal of strength; if half the team hates a name and half loves it, there is energy there (e.g., the Pentium story).",
    "Do not use large group brainstorms; they regress to the mean. Use small teams (2 people) working in parallel.",
    "A name provides an 'asymmetric advantage'—it is the only marketing asset used in every single interaction for the life of the company.",
    "Use 'Sound Symbolism' to map letters to attributes: 'V' creates vibrancy (Vercel), 'B' signals reliability (BlackBerry), 'Z' creates noise (Azure).",
    "The .com domain is an 'area code'—it matters far less than having the right name. Don't sacrifice the brand name just to get a matching URL.",
    "Compound names (Windsurf, Facebook, PowerPoint) act as multipliers (1+1=3) because they trigger multiple association networks in the brain."

      "summary": "A geometric exercise to align stakeholders on the specific behavior and experience the name must evoke before any creative work begins.",
      "principles": [
        "Draw a diamond. At the top, write 'WIN'. Define exactly what winning looks like for this product.",
        "Right Point: 'What do we HAVE to win?' (Current assets, technology, team strengths).",
        "Bottom Point: 'What do we NEED to win?' (Market gaps, specific perceptions, resources).",
        "Left Point: 'What do we have to SAY to win?' (The core narrative).",
        "Synthesize: Focus the naming effort on the 'Say' point—translate that message into a behavior or experience, not just a description."

      "whenToUse": "At the very beginning of a naming project, before any brainstorming occurs, to align co-founders or stakeholders.",
      "commonMistakes": "Listing 'A good name' under 'What do we need to win' (circular logic) or rushing the exercise in under an hour.",

        "Team A gets the 'Real Brief': They know the product and its specs.",
        "Team B gets the 'Metaphor Brief': Tell them they are naming a physical object that shares the product's attributes (e.g., 'Name a fast bicycle' instead of 'fast software').",
        "Team C gets the 'Experience Brief': Focus purely on the feeling (e.g., 'Name something that represents flow').",

      "realWorldExample": "For 'Windsurf' (an AI coding agent), a team was tasked with exploring words related to movement, flow, and sports, rather than 'coding' or 'AI', leading to the final name."
