  "episodeSummary": "David Placek demystifies the black box of product naming, transforming it from a creative guessing game into a rigorous science combining linguistics, cognitive psychology, and strategy. He challenges the common desire for 'comfortable' names, arguing that distinctiveness requires discomfort and friction. The episode details Lexicon's proprietary three-step process, specific exercises for founders to define their 'win' state, and the hidden power of sound symbolism in influencing consumer behavior.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Comfort is the enemy of a great name; if your team is immediately comfortable with a name, it is likely too descriptive and safe.",
    "Polarization is a signal of strength; if half the team hates a name and half loves it, there is energy there (e.g., the Pentium story).",
    "Do not use large group brainstorms; they regress to the mean. Use small teams (2 people) working in parallel.",
    "A name provides an 'asymmetric advantage'—it is the only marketing asset used in every single interaction for the life of the company.",
    "Use 'Sound Symbolism' to map letters to attributes: 'V' creates vibrancy (Vercel), 'B' signals reliability (BlackBerry), 'Z' creates noise (Azure).",
    "The .com domain is an 'area code'—it matters far less than having the right name. Don't sacrifice the brand name just to get a matching URL.",
    "Compound names (Windsurf, Facebook, PowerPoint) act as multipliers (1+1=3) because they trigger multiple association networks in the brain."
