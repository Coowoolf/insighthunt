    "background": "Ramesh Johari is a professor at Stanford University specializing in data science, game theory, and the design of online marketplaces. He has served as an advisor to major tech companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Upwork, helping them solve complex problems related to matching, pricing, and experimentation.",
    "background_zh": "Ramesh Johari 是斯坦福大学教授，专攻数据科学、博弈论及在线市场设计。作为 Airbnb、Uber 和 Upwork 等科技巨头的资深顾问，他致力于解决平台匹配、定价策略及实验设计等复杂商业问题。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Ramesh Johari dives deep into the science of building thriving marketplaces, arguing that marketplaces primarily sell the reduction of transaction friction rather than just goods. He explores the crucial distinction between predictive machine learning and causal decision-making, the nuances of designing fair rating systems, and why founders should focus on liquidity before platform dynamics.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Ramesh Johari 深入探讨了构建繁荣交易市场的科学原理，提出平台的核心价值在于消除交易摩擦而非单纯售卖商品。节目中详细剖析了预测性机器学习与因果导向决策的区别、如何设计公平的评价体系，以及为何创业者应在关注平台机制前优先解决流动性问题。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Marketplaces create value by removing transaction friction (finding, matching, trusting), not just aggregating supply.",
    "Don't define yourself as a 'marketplace founder' until you have scaled liquidity on both sides; start by solving a specific problem.",
    "Machine Learning models excel at prediction (correlation), but business strategy requires causal inference (decision making).",
    "Experimentation isn't just about 'winning' or 'losing'; you must pay for learning, even from failed experiments.",
    "Simple averaging of ratings hurts new entrants; use priors and Bayesian approaches to ensure distributional fairness.",
    "Marketplace management is like 'Whac-a-mole': optimizing one metric often negatively impacts another group, creating winners and losers."
