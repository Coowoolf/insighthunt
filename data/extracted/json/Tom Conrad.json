  "episodeSummary": "Tom Conrad shares lessons from a 30-year career spanning massive successes like Pandora and Snap, and famous failures like Pets.com and Quibi. He discusses the importance of viewing a company as a 'math equation' rather than just a product, the pitfalls of consensus-driven cultures, and why not everyone needs to be a founder to have outsized impact.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Tom Conrad 分享了他 30 年职业生涯中的深刻教训，涵盖了 Pandora 和 Snap 的巨大成功，以及 Pets.com 和 Quibi 的著名失败案例。他探讨了为何应将公司视为一个“数学方程”而不仅仅是产品，分析了共识驱动文化的陷阱，并解释了为何不一定非要成为创始人才能创造巨大的影响力。",

    "Product execution cannot save a broken business model equation (e.g., Quibi).",

    "Radical transparency in customer support can drive massive organic growth (Pandora).",
    "You don't need to be a founder to achieve founder-level impact or financial returns.",
    "Beware of consensus paralysis: 'A vote of 1000 to 1 is a tie' slows innovation.",
