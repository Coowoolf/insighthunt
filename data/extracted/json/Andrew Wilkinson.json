      "summary": "A strategy derived from Charlie Munger that advises entrepreneurs to avoid hyper-competitive markets ('crowded ponds') and instead seek out niches where there is high demand but low competition ('forest ponds').",
      "principles": [
        "Avoid the 'Gym' mentality: Don't try to deadlift 300lbs (compete with giants) on day one.",
        "Ignore the 'Cool' Factor: Boring businesses (pest control, government forms) often have better ratios of demand to competition than cool businesses (cafes, AI).",

      "whenToUse": "During the ideation phase of a startup or when pivoting a business model.",
      "commonMistakes": "Thinking 'I can do it better' in a market where many others have repeatedly failed (e.g., starting a restaurant or bar without experience).",
      "quote": "If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen... you actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition.",
      "realWorldExample": "Andrew's friend starting a grease trap cleaning business for restaurants (high demand, low competition) vs. starting the restaurant itself (high competition, low margin).",
