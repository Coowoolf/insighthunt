    "company": "Stanford University / Wodtke Consulting",
    "background": "Christina is the author of the seminal OKR book 'Radical Focus' and teaches product management at Stanford. She is a former product leader at LinkedIn, MySpace, Zynga, and Yahoo, known for helping companies fix broken execution processes through OKRs and storytelling.",
    "background_zh": "Christina 是 OKR 领域里程碑式著作《绝对聚焦》（Radical Focus）的作者，同时在斯坦福大学教授产品管理课程。她曾是 LinkedIn、MySpace、Zynga 和 Yahoo 的产品高管，尤其擅长利用 OKR 和叙事技巧（Storytelling）帮助企业修复执行流程中的断层。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "In this deep dive into execution, Christina Wodtke dismantles the bureaucratic view of OKRs, reframing them as a tool for learning and focus rather than just goal-setting. She outlines the precise cadence required to make OKRs work, the connection between 5-year missions and weekly tasks, and why 'product sense' is often just a myth for junior PMs. The episode provides a blueprint for fixing dysfunctional teams by establishing a rhythm of commitment and celebration.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The atomic unit of an OKR is not the quarter, but the weekly question: 'What are we doing this week to get closer to our goals?'",
    "Use temporal landmarks to structure execution: Monday is for commitment (planning), Friday is for celebration (wins).",
    "Limit yourself to one Objective and three Key Results per cycle to force actual prioritization rather than a wishlist.",
    "When defining Key Results, always ask 'How would we know?' to move from vague aspirations to concrete measurements.",
    "Stop wasting time on heavy approval processes; use a 'Rule of Three' peer review with a 24-hour turnaround for OKRs.",
    "Grading OKRs (e.g., 0.7 vs 0.8) matters less than the retrospective conversation about *why* you hit or missed the goal.",
    "Product Managers serve the business first; understanding business models is more critical than 'product sense' or UX for early-career PMs.",
    "If your OKR review meetings are boring, you are operating at the wrong level (discussing tasks instead of strategy)."
