    "title": "Author & Lecturer at Stanford University",
    "company": "Stanford University / Wodtke Consulting",
    "background": "Christina is the author of the seminal OKR book 'Radical Focus' and teaches product management at Stanford. She is a former product leader at LinkedIn, MySpace, Zynga, and Yahoo, known for helping companies fix broken execution processes through OKRs and storytelling."
  },
  "episodeSummary": "In this deep dive into execution, Christina Wodtke dismantles the bureaucratic view of OKRs, reframing them as a tool for learning and focus rather than just goal-setting. She outlines the precise cadence required to make OKRs work, the connection between 5-year missions and weekly tasks, and why 'product sense' is often just a myth for junior PMs. The episode provides a blueprint for fixing dysfunctional teams by establishing a rhythm of commitment and celebration.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The atomic unit of an OKR is not the quarter, but the weekly question: 'What are we doing this week to get closer to our goals?'",
    "Use temporal landmarks to structure execution: Monday is for commitment (planning), Friday is for celebration (wins).",
    "Limit yourself to one Objective and three Key Results per cycle to force actual prioritization rather than a wishlist.",
    "When defining Key Results, always ask 'How would we know?' to move from vague aspirations to concrete measurements.",
    "Stop wasting time on heavy approval processes; use a 'Rule of Three' peer review with a 24-hour turnaround for OKRs.",
    "Grading OKRs (e.g., 0.7 vs 0.8) matters less than the retrospective conversation about *why* you hit or missed the goal.",
    "Product Managers serve the business first; understanding business models is more critical than 'product sense' or UX for early-career PMs.",
    "If your OKR review meetings are boring, you are operating at the wrong level (discussing tasks instead of strategy)."

        "Monday Commitments: The team meets to explicitly state what they will do *this week* to move the OKR needle.",
        "The 4-Square Status Email: Send a weekly update containing: 1) Confidence level (0-10) in hitting the OKR, 2) Last week's progress, 3) Next week's priorities, 4) Blockers/Risks.",
        "Friday Wins: Hold a 'wins' meeting on Friday where teams share the most awesome thing that happened (marketing, design, or eng) to build momentum.",
        "The Learning Loop: If a task from 'Next Week' doesn't move to 'Last Week' (done), the status update forces a conversation about why, driving immediate learning."

      "whenToUse": "When teams feel busy but aren't making progress on strategic goals, or when morale is low due to a lack of visible progress.",
      "commonMistakes": "Letting the Monday meeting devolve into a general status update of all tasks, rather than only discussing tasks related to the OKR.",

      "realWorldExample": "Christina's experience at Zynga where short, focused status emails allowed her to scan the entire company's progress and identify connection points without meetings."
