  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Marily Nika demystifies the role of an AI Product Manager, explaining how it differs from traditional product management through the management of uncertainty and research cycles. She warns against the \"shiny object trap,\" advises on how to build MVPs without actual AI code, and provides a roadmap for PMs to acquire technical intuition. The conversation also covers practical tools for non-technical PMs and strategies for bridging the gap between academic research and viable business products.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Marily Nika 揭开了 AI 产品经理的神秘面纱，阐述了该角色如何通过管理不确定性和科研周期，与传统产品经理区分开来。她警示了“追逐热点陷阱”，建议在 MVP 阶段无需编写 AI 代码即可进行验证，并为 PM 提供了建立技术直觉的路线图。对话还涵盖了非技术背景 PM 的实用工具，以及如何弥合学术研究与商业化产品之间鸿沟的策略。",

    "Generalist PMs build the right product; AI PMs solve the right problem.",
    "Avoid the 'Shiny Object Trap': Do not implement AI just for the sake of using new technology; ensure there is a genuine user pain point.",
    "Do not train custom models for an MVP; use prototyping tools or manual operations ('Wizard of Oz') to validate demand first.",
    "AI Product Management requires a shift in mindset to embrace uncertainty and non-deterministic outcomes common in research.",
    "PMs act as the bridge between Research Scientists and business goals, translating academic hypotheses into monetizable features.",
    "Even without a CS degree, PMs should learn the basics of training a model (e.g., using No-Code tools like AutoML) to understand trade-offs and build intuition.",
    "Use 'adjacent products' (successful examples from other companies) to get stakeholder buy-in for risky AI bets."
