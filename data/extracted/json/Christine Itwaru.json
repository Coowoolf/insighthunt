    "background": "A long-time product leader who transitioned from traditional Product Management to pioneering the Product Operations function at Pendo. She is a recognized thought leader in the Product Ops space, helping define the role's scope, value, and execution strategy for the broader tech industry.",
    "background_zh": "一位资深产品管理者，从传统产品管理转型，在 Pendo 率先开拓了 Product Ops 职能。作为该领域公认的思想领袖，她协助整个科技行业定义了这一角色的职责边界、核心价值及落地策略。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Christine Itwaru demystifies the rising role of Product Operations, distinguishing it from Project Management and Product Marketing. She articulates how Product Ops acts as a strategic enabler that removes internal friction, allowing PMs to focus on customers rather than internal firefighting. The conversation covers how to diagnose if an organization needs Product Ops, how to structure the function, and how to execute specific workflows like Voice of Customer synthesis and internal launch readiness.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Product Ops is not just a role but a system; if you can't hire a person, you must still build the system to shield PMs from internal noise.",
    "The primary signal that you need Product Ops is when PMs spend more time fielding internal questions from Sales/CS than talking to actual customers.",
    "Distinguish Product Ops from Product Marketing (PMM): PMM helps the world understand the product; Product Ops helps the internal revenue teams understand the product's value and readiness.",
    "Use a 'Product Digest' not just for status updates, but to teach internal teams how to get customers ready for changes.",
    "When analyzing Voice of Customer (VoC), bring Sales and CS into the same room; often their needs conflict, and they need to hear that friction directly to align.",
    "Product Ops should aim to automate its initial tactical work (like manual reporting) to evolve into strategic advisory roles over time.",
    "Bringing engineers into customer calls is a low-effort, high-impact way to increase development velocity and empathy."

        "Identify the Transparency Gap: If PMs feel overburdened but Revenue teams still feel uninformed, you have a structural transparency failure, not a personnel failure.",
