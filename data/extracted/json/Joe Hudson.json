  "episodeSummary": "Joe Hudson joins Lenny to deconstruct the hidden emotional barriers that stifle productivity and leadership in tech. They discuss why the 'inner critic' is mathematically inefficient, how to use enjoyment as a productivity metric, and why meetings are the atomic unit of company culture.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Joe Hudson 与 Lenny 深度探讨了阻碍科技圈领袖生产力和领导力的隐性情绪障碍。这期播客揭示了为什么“内部批判声音”在逻辑上是低效的，如何将“愉悦感”作为生产力指标，以及为何会议是衡量公司文化的原子单位。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Efficiency is not about speed; it's about energy management. If you enjoy a task 10% more, you are 10% more efficient.",
    "The critical voice in your head is always factually wrong and functions like a scared child, not a boss.",
    "Meetings are the 'atomic structure' of a company; if a meeting sucks, it's a leading indicator of a deeper structural or personnel problem.",
    "Decision fatigue is solved by defining 5 core principles; this automates difficult choices.",
    "You invite the specific emotion you are trying to avoid (e.g., avoiding conflict creates a chaotic, conflict-ridden environment).",
    "A 7-minute daily gratitude practice (felt, not just thought) can rewrite your relationship with scarcity and resource constraints."
