  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Tristan de Montebello deconstructs public speaking from a performance art into a trainable meta-skill. He introduces a gamified approach to mastering communication under pressure, focusing on 'turbulence training' to build resilience. The conversation covers actionable tactics for speech preparation, eliminating filler words through presence, and the psychology of 'staying in character' to project confidence.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Tristan de Montebello 将公共演讲解构为一种可训练的元技能（Meta-skill），而非单纯的表演艺术。他介绍了一套游戏化的方法来掌握高压环境下的沟通技巧，重点通过“气流颠簸训练”来建立韧性。对话涵盖了演讲准备的实操战术、通过提升临场感消除废话，以及利用“保持角色”心理学来投射自信。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Speaking is a meta-skill that accelerates all other professional competencies.",
    "If you don't enjoy speaking, you are likely overthinking; aim for a flow state.",
    "Don't 'leak' your insecurities; the audience cannot see your internal anxiety unless you verbalize it.",
    "Look up to think (access visual memory) rather than looking down (which signals insecurity).",
    "Use the 'Accordion Method' to internalize speeches rather than memorizing scripts.",
    "Practice implies creating 'turbulence'—simulating distractions and pressure in low-stakes environments."
