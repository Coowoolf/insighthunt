    "background": "Deb Liu is the CEO of Ancestry and a former VP of Product at Facebook, where she built Facebook Marketplace to over 1 billion users and led the development of Facebook's mobile ad products. She also held leadership roles at PayPal and eBay and serves on the board of Intuit.",
    "background_zh": "Deb Liu 现任 Ancestry CEO，曾任 Facebook 产品副总裁。在 Facebook 任职期间，她一手打造了 Facebook Marketplace 并将其用户规模拓展至超 10 亿，同时主导了移动广告产品的开发。此外，她曾在 PayPal 和 eBay 担任核心管理职务，目前兼任 Intuit 董事会成员。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Deb Liu shares a masterclass on navigating a product career, balancing the creation of zero-to-one billion-dollar businesses within large corporations, and overcoming the challenges of introversion in leadership. She provides tactical frameworks for treating your career with the same rigor as a product roadmap and offers specific strategies for onboarding successfully into executive roles.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Prioritize the slope of learning over current mastery; the best PMs are constant students, not static experts.",
    "Treat your career like a product: write a spec, define success metrics, and audit your trajectory against a 5-year vision rather than drifting between roles.",
    "When building 0-to-1 products inside large companies, avoid the limelight early on to escape premature scrutiny and 'loving a product to death' before it iterates.",
    "Reframe 'self-promotion' as 'educating stakeholders to secure resources for your team' to overcome the reluctance to speak up.",
    "Growth is often a 'game of inches' rather than silver bullets; success comes from relentless optimization of core loops rather than just step-function changes.",
    "During onboarding, diagnose before you treat: spend the first 30 days listening to 50+ people before proposing solutions.",
    "The most critical career decision you make is who you marry; ensure your partner is a 'yin to your yang' who lifts your career rather than adding drag."

        "Write the Spec: Document the specific skills, experiences ('features'), and milestones needed to reach the vision.",
        "Audit Trajectory: Evaluate every potential role not by salary or prestige, but by whether it moves you closer to the spec's destination.",
