  "episodeSummary": "Bill Carr, co-author of 'Working Backwards', deconstructs the key management philosophies and processes that drove Amazon's scale from a bookstore to a global tech giant. The conversation covers the practical implementation of working backwards from the customer, structuring teams for autonomy through single-threaded leadership, focusing on controllable input metrics over financial outputs, and maintaining high talent standards via the Bar Raiser program.",
