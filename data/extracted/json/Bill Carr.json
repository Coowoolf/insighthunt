  "episodeSummary": "Bill Carr, co-author of 'Working Backwards', deconstructs the key management philosophies and processes that drove Amazon's scale from a bookstore to a global tech giant. The conversation covers the practical implementation of working backwards from the customer, structuring teams for autonomy through single-threaded leadership, focusing on controllable input metrics over financial outputs, and maintaining high talent standards via the Bar Raiser program.",

      "category": "Product Strategy",
      "summary": "A product development process that starts with the customer by writing a Press Release and FAQ documents before any coding begins. This ensures the product solves a real customer problem and forces clarity of thought.",

      "problemItSolves": "Prevents building products that work technically but solve no meaningful customer problem; avoids the 'solution in search of a problem' trap (e.g., Fire Phone).",
      "whenToUse": "At the very beginning of the product development lifecycle, before allocating engineering resources.",
      "commonMistakes": "Using hyperbole/marketing fluff instead of factual descriptions; writing it as a real external PR rather than an internal validation document; skipping the iterative review process.",
      "quote": "We're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there.",
      "realWorldExample": "AWS and Prime Video were both defined via PR/FAQs before they existed; The Fire Phone is cited as a failure where the process may have been overridden or the problem wasn't validated.",
