  "episodeSummary": "Anton Osika shares how Lovable, an AI software engineer, reached $10M ARR in two months with a team of 15. He discusses the 'scaling laws' of AI reliability, his intense 'Shackleton-style' hiring philosophy for finding 'cracked' engineers, and the evolution of product building from MVP to 'Absolutely Lovable Products' in an age where coding is democratized.",

      "summary": "A systematic approach to improving AI reliability by treating 'getting stuck' as the primary bottleneck. Instead of broad improvements, the team painstakingly identifies specific failure modes (bugs, dead ends) and creates tight feedback loops to quantifiably tune the system against those blockers.",

        "Identify exact points where the AI gets 'stuck' (e.g., auth, payments)",
        "Address specific bottlenecks rather than general intelligence",
