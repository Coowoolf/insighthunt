    "background": "Carole Robin taught the legendary 'Interpersonal Dynamics' (known as 'Touchy Feely') course at Stanford GSB for over 20 years. She is the co-author of 'Connect' and now runs Leaders in Tech, helping high-growth tech leaders build robust relationships and effective cultures.",
    "background_zh": "Carole Robin 曾在斯坦福商学院执教传奇课程“人际动力学”（Interpersonal Dynamics，业内俗称 \"Touchy Feely\"）长达 20 余年。作为《Connect》一书的合著者，她目前掌舵 Leaders in Tech，致力于帮助高增长科技企业的管理者构建深度人际连接与高效的组织文化。"

  "episodeSummary": "Carole Robin dismantles the myth that 'soft skills' are secondary in business, arguing that interpersonal competence is the primary driver of professional success. She provides a masterclass on giving feedback without causing defensiveness, the strategic use of vulnerability, and how to navigate the 'three realities' of human interaction. The episode offers a rigorous toolkit for product leaders to move relationships from transactional to exceptional.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Feedback fails when you cross the 'Net': You only know your intent and your behavior; you do not know the other person's reality.",
    "Eliminate 'I feel that' and 'I feel like' from your vocabulary; these are thoughts and judgments masquerading as emotions, and they trigger defensiveness.",
    "Anger is a secondary emotion that usually pushes people away; expressing the underlying fear or hurt draws people in and solves problems faster.",
    "Apply the 15% Rule to vulnerability: disclose just 15% outside your comfort zone to build trust without being professionally inappropriate.",
    "Stop asking 'Why' questions; they imply judgment. Switch to 'What,' 'Where,' 'When,' and 'How' to foster genuine inquiry.",
    "Mental models formed early in careers (e.g., 'emotions don't belong at work') often become blockers for senior leadership roles.",
    "Use the AFOG acronym (Another F***ing Opportunity For Growth) to instantly reframe failure into a learning mechanism."

      "summary": "A framework that separates an interaction into three distinct realities to ensure feedback is fact-based and disputable. It forces the speaker to stay on 'their side of the net' by only discussing what they know to be true.",
      "principles": [
        "Identify Reality #1 (Intent): Know that your internal intent is invisible to others.",
        "Identify Reality #2 (Behavior): Focus strictly on observable actions (what was said or done). This is the only shared reality.",
        "Identify Reality #3 (Impact): Acknowledge you do not know the other person's reality. Only speak to the impact their behavior had on you.",
        "Use the Formula: 'When you [Specific Behavior], I feel [Specific Emotion from Vocabulary List] because [Impact/Reason].'",

      "commonMistakes": "Using 'I feel that...' or 'I feel like...' followed by a judgment (e.g., 'I feel like you don't care'). This is an attribution, not a feeling.",
      "quote": "I feel that you don't care and I feel you're being insensitive are not feelings, and that's where we make our biggest mistakes when it comes to feedback.",
      "realWorldExample": "Carole's student felt disrespected when she checked her watch. Instead of saying 'You are rude,' he said, 'When you looked at your watch while I was answering, I felt disrespected.'",
