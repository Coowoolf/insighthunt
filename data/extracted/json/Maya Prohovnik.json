  "episodeSummary": "Maya Prohovnik discusses the journey of scaling Anchor from a small startup to the core of Spotify's podcasting dominance. She reveals how they used manual \"Wizard of Oz\" tactics to solve distribution friction, why aggressive dogfooding is non-negotiable for creator tools, and how to balance data with product intuition when making existential pivots.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Maya Prohovnik 讲述了 Anchor 从初创公司扩展为 Spotify 播客业务核心的历程。她揭示了团队如何利用人工手段解决分发摩擦的“绿野仙踪”式策略，通过激进的“吃狗粮”文化打磨创作者工具，以及在面临生死攸关的转型时，如何在数据指标与产品直觉之间取得平衡。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Dogfooding is not just testing; it's about experiencing the emotional anxiety of the user.",
    "Sometimes you must pivot away from a product with good retention if the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is too small.",
    "Do things that don't scale: Use manual labor (interns) to create 'magical' automated experiences for users early on.",
    "Treat your 'gut feeling' as a valid data point derived from synthesized experience.",
    "In a post-acquisition scenario, your job is to stay excited and 'sell' your value to the new parent company constantly."
