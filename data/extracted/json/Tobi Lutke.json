    "background": "Tobi Lütke is the founder and CEO of Shopify, the global commerce platform powering millions of businesses. A programmer by trade, he built the first version of Shopify to sell snowboards, eventually scaling it into one of the most significant technology companies in the world known for its unique engineering culture.",
    "background_zh": "Tobi Lütke 是 Shopify 的创始人兼 CEO，该全球电商平台如今支撑着数百万商家的业务。作为一名极客程序员，他最初为了在网上卖滑雪板编写了 Shopify 的初代代码，并最终将其扩展为世界上最重要的科技公司之一，以其独特的工程文化而闻名。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "In this conversation, Tobi Lütke deconstructs his philosophy on building enduring products by rejecting industry norms like OKRs and embracing first principles thinking. He discusses the 'Tobi Tornado' method for rapid course correction, the distinction between tactical and positional games in business, and why optimizing for unquantifiable metrics like 'delight' often yields better long-term results.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本次对话中，Tobi Lütke 拆解了他打造长青产品的哲学：拒绝 OKR 等行业惯例，转而拥抱第一性原理思维。他深入探讨了用于极速纠偏的“托比风暴（Tobi Tornado）”机制，剖析了商业中“战术游戏”与“战略定位游戏”的区别，并解释了为何优化“愉悦感”等难以量化的指标往往能带来更卓越的长期回报。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Most business practices (like RFPs or copying competitors) are results of path dependence, not optimal design.",
    "Optimize for 'positional games' (trust, platform value) over 'tactical games' (conversion hacks) to ensure longevity.",
    "Avoiding 'founder mode' intervention when a project is off-track is an abdication of responsibility; kill bad projects immediately.",
    "Metrics often lead to 'overfitting' or Goodhart's Law; prioritize unquantifiable qualities like craft, fun, and delight.",
    "Talent is often limited by context; reminding people of their maximum potential is a leader's high-leverage activity.",
    "Treat your career as a 'talent stack'—combining 3-4 distinct interests (e.g., coding + retail + poker) creates a unique competitive advantage."
