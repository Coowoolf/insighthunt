  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Lane Shackleton 分享了他对产品领导力的深刻见解，区分了优秀产品经理的个人原则与高绩效团队的运作仪式 (Rituals)。他探讨了用于决策的 'Catalyst' 框架、向“双向交互式文档”转型的必要性，以及如何通过“不适感”来衡量职业成长。对话涵盖了如何将模糊转化为清晰，以及建立“实干优于空谈”文化的实操策略。",

    "Great PMs focus on building consistent systems rather than just hitting static goals.",
    "To assess career growth, track the frequency of 'Oh Shit' moments where you feel underqualified.",

    "Use 'Two-Way Writeups' with sentiment tables (Pulse) to gather inclusive feedback, rather than relying on comment threads.",
    "Test the extremes immediately (e.g., giant skip button vs. tiny one) instead of debating for months.",
    "Distinguish between strategy and OKRs; do not plan for more than 10% of the execution period."
