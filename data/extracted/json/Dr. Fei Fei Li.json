    "company": "World Labs / Stanford University",
    "background": "Known as the 'Godmother of AI,' Dr. Li is the creator of ImageNet, the dataset that sparked the modern deep learning revolution. She previously served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud and is a pioneer in computer vision, spatial intelligence, and human-centered AI.",
    "background_zh": "李飞飞博士被誉为“AI 教母”，是引爆现代深度学习革命的 ImageNet 数据集的缔造者。她曾任 Google Cloud AI/ML 首席科学家，也是计算机视觉、空间智能及“以人为本的 AI”领域的先驱。"

  "episodeSummary": "Dr. Fei-Fei Li traces the arc of AI development from the 'AI Winter' to the current generative explosion, detailing how her creation of ImageNet shifted the industry's focus from algorithms to data scale. She introduces her new venture, World Labs, and the concept of 'World Models'—AI that possesses spatial intelligence and understanding of physics—arguing this is the missing link for robotics and true AGI. The conversation also covers the necessity of human-centered design and the importance of 'intellectual fearlessness' in career pivots.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Invert the problem solving stack: When algorithm innovation stalls, the bottleneck is likely the data scale, not the code (The ImageNet Lesson).",
    "Spatial Intelligence is the next moat: Moving beyond Language Models (LLMs) to World Models that understand 3D geometry and physics is critical for embodied AI and robotics.",
    "The 'Bitter Lesson' applies to robotics: Simple algorithms combined with massive scale (data + compute) generally outperform complex, hand-crafted rules, though robotics data is currently the scarcity.",
    "Design for delight in deep tech: Even in complex frontier models, small UX details (like the pre-rendering 'dots' in Marble) are essential for user bridging and delight.",
    "Practice 'Intellectual Fearlessness': When evaluating career or product bets, optimize for the mission and the people rather than trying to calculate every downside risk.",
    "Human-Centered AI is an architectural requirement: Define products by how they augment human agency and dignity, not just by their automation efficiency."

      "summary": "Instead of refining the processing engine (the model/algorithm), this methodology shifts the entire focus to the fuel (the data). It involves identifying a 'North Star' problem (e.g., Object Recognition) and hypothesizing that the solution lies in the scale and granularity of the input data rather than the complexity of the processing logic.",
      "principles": [
        "Identify the North Star Problem: Choose a fundamental capability that is currently broken or primitive (e.g., 'Computers cannot see objects').",
        "Hypothesize the Missing Ingredient: If current models fail, assume the deficit is experiential/data-based, not just logic-based.",
        "Aggressive Data Scaling: Move from thousands of examples to millions (ImageNet went to 15M images). Scale is a quality of its own.",
        "Democratize the Benchmark: Release the dataset/problem publicly to allow the ecosystem to iterate on the solution (The ImageNet Challenge)."

      "commonMistakes": "Focusing on data quantity without clean labeling/taxonomy (the taxonomy of ImageNet was as vital as the images).",
      "quote": "It dawned on me that human learning as well as evolution is actually a big data learning process... I think my students and I conjectured that a very critically-overlooked ingredient of bringing AI to life is big data.",

      "summary_zh": "该方法论不再单纯打磨处理引擎（模型/算法），而是将战略重心完全转移至“燃料”（数据）。它要求首先锁定一个“北极星问题”（如物体识别），并提出假设：解决方案的关键在于输入数据的规模与颗粒度，而非处理逻辑的复杂度。",

      "realWorldExample_zh": "2007 年，通过全网抓取并利用 Amazon Mechanical Turk 对 1500 万张图片进行标注，成功构建了 ImageNet，这一举措直接促成了 2012 年 AlexNet 的突破性进展。",

        "锁定“北极星”问题：选择一项目前尚未解决或处于原始阶段的基础能力（例如，“计算机无法识别物体”）。",
        "假设关键缺失要素：若当前模型失效，应假设其短板在于数据积累或经验层面，而非单纯的逻辑架构缺陷。",
        "激进的数据规模化：将样本量级从数千提升至数百万（如 ImageNet 扩展至 1500 万张图像），坚信规模本身即是质量。",
