      "commonMistakes": "Trying to create a category without existing competition (competition validates the category) or ignoring how customers actually search for solutions.",
      "quote": "When you're building a category... you want to have a lot of traction in terms of thought leadership... but also educate buyers that there is a category they can now budget for.",
      "realWorldExample": "Greenhouse trying to create 'Recruiting Optimization' but ultimately accepting the 'ATS' category because that's where the budget was; Miro creating 'Visual Collaboration' because 'Online Whiteboard' was too small.",
