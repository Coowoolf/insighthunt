    "background": "A PR expert and founder of Six Eastern, an agency that has worked with over 100 tech companies including Ramp and Perplexity. Previously led communications at Uber and Box, specializing in turning product launches and corporate milestones into strategic media coverage.",

  "episodeSummary": "Emilie Gerber deconstructs the black box of public relations for startups, moving beyond theory to strictly tactical advice. She outlines how to craft pitches that actually get opened, why \"category creation\" is a failing narrative strategy for press, and how to differentiate media targets based on business goals (funding vs. product growth). The conversation provides a blueprint for founders and product leaders to generate coverage without needing expensive agencies or warm introductions.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "For B2B products, the value of PR is second-order validation (hiring, investor confidence, sales enablement) rather than direct user acquisition.",
    "Stop pitching 'Category Creation'; reporters ignore it. Instead, pitch an 'Incumbent Takedown' story where you anchor against a known giant (e.g., 'We are doing what Salesforce does, but X way better').",
    "Warm introductions to reporters are overrated; a concise, targeted cold pitch (3 sentences) is often more effective because it respects the reporter's time.",
    "Target publications based on specific goals: TechCrunch for funding, Axios for deals/M&A, Business Insider for pitch decks/founder journeys, and VentureBeat for AI/Technical news.",
    "Avoid 'marketing speak' in launch materials. If you can't read your press release out loud to a friend without sounding like a corporate bot, rewrite it.",
    "Leverage podcasts and newsletters as core media channels, often yielding higher engagement than traditional tier-1 publications.",
    "When pitching funding, keep it clinically simple: Amount raised, lead investors, and one sentence on why it matters. Do not bury the lead with a long vision statement."

      "problemItSolves": "Startups often fail to get press because they pitch complex 'category creation' stories that reporters find confusing or unverifiable.",
      "summary": "A positioning framework that anchors a new product against a well-known industry giant. By defining the product in relation to an incumbent, you give the reporter immediate context and inherent conflict, which drives story interest.",
      "principles": [
        "Identify the 'Household Name': Find the massive incumbent your product competes with or improves upon (e.g., Salesforce, Bill.com).",
        "Define the Specific Wedge: Articulate exactly one way you are better or different, rather than listing every feature.",
        "Put the Conflict in the Subject Line: Use the formula 'Company X taking on [Incumbent] with [Specific Approach]'.",
        "Avoid Category Creation Jargon: Do not claim to be the 'first' to do something obscure; claim to be the 'best' at fixing a known problem created by the incumbent."
      ],
      "whenToUse": "When launching a product in a crowded market or when the product is complex and difficult to explain from scratch.",
      "commonMistakes": "Claiming to be a 'Category Creator' which signals marketing fluff to reporters, or choosing an incumbent that isn't actually well-known enough to serve as an anchor.",
      "quote": "A lot of companies want to position themselves as category creators, and I actually hate that. It doesn't work... It doesn't land with press... Instead, it's actually really great when you can talk about how you are doing what X household name does, but better.",
      "realWorldExample": "Ramp's launch of their bill pay offering. Instead of pitching 'streamlined vendor payments,' Six Eastern pitched it as 'Ramp taking on Bill.com' (a public company). This angle secured a CNBC feature for a product update that typically wouldn't get covered.",
