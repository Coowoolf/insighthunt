  "episodeSummary": "Hari discusses how LinkedIn manages its massive, complex ecosystem by aligning every decision to a single North Star: connecting people to economic opportunity. He shares frameworks for decision-making velocity in large organizations, the shift from title-based to skills-based hiring, and his model for evaluating Product Manager talent.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Hari 探讨了领英如何通过将所有决策对齐到“连接经济机会”这一北极星指标，来管理其庞大且复杂的生态系统。他分享了大型组织中提升决策速度的框架、从“基于头衔”向“基于技能”招聘的转变，以及评估产品经理人才的独特模型。",
