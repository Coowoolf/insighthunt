  "episodeSummary": "Sean Ellis deconstructs the science of Product-Market Fit (PMF) using his famous 'Sean Ellis Test' and outlines a systematic approach to sustainable growth. He explains why startups should focus on activation and onboarding before acquisition, and how to combine qualitative insights with data to drive high-velocity experimentation.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Sean Ellis 通过他著名的“Sean Ellis 测试”深度解析了产品市场匹配（PMF）的科学量化方法，并描绘了可持续增长的系统性路径。他解释了为什么初创公司应在扩大获客前优先解决激活和用户引导问题，以及如何结合定性洞察与数据驱动来实现高频实验迭代。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The 40% 'Very Disappointed' threshold is the leading indicator of Product-Market Fit.",
    "Do not scale customer acquisition until you have fixed your activation and retention leaky buckets.",
    "Ignore 'somewhat disappointed' users initially; focusing on them dilutes value for your 'must-have' users.",
    "North Star Metrics should measure value delivered to the customer, not revenue.",
    "Qualitative research (asking 'why') is often the key to unlocking quantitative roadblocks.",
    "Growth Hacking is not about 'hacks'; it's about a disciplined process of high-velocity testing.",
    "Focus first on the users who love your product and understand deeply why they consider it a 'must-have'."
