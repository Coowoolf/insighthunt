  "episodeSummary": "Krithika Shankarraman shares her experiences building marketing functions from scratch at iconic companies like OpenAI and Stripe. She debunks the idea of a universal marketing \"playbook,\" introducing her DATE framework for diagnosis and differentiation, and discusses how technical founders and marketers can align through rigorous internal processes.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Krithika Shankarraman 分享了她在 OpenAI 和 Stripe 等标志性公司从零搭建营销团队的经验。她反驳了通用的营销“打法（Playbook）”论，提出了用于诊断和差异化的 DATE 框架，并探讨了技术型创始人和营销人员如何通过严格的内部流程实现对齐。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Avoid 'vanity metrics' (likes/views) and focus on revenue impact and pipeline quality.",
    "For technical products, marketing must be an extension of the product; quality and accuracy build trust with developers.",
    "Marketing isn't just a department ('Capital M'); it's the company's story and market approach ('lowercase m').",
    "Don't hire a demand gen leader if you have a conversion problem; fix Product-Market Fit first.",
    "Process speeds you up: Transparent review cycles (20%/80%) prevent last-minute blockers and ensure consistency.",
    "Differentiation matters more than being 'better' or 'cheaper'—especially in the AI era.",
    "The 'Chameleon CMO' adapts to the company's stage rather than applying a rigid template."
