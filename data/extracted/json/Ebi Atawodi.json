  "episodeSummary": "Ebi Atawodi dissects the elusive skill of crafting and communicating a product vision, moving beyond buzzwords to provide a tactical step-by-step playbook. She details how to transform vague ideas into concrete narratives using storytelling frameworks, how to rigorously define problems before solving them, and how to build deep conviction within a product team. The conversation also explores the nuance of product culture across Uber, Netflix, and Google, and the importance of 'love' over 'liking' in leadership.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "A good vision must be lofty yet realistic, devoid of current technical limitations, and grounded in a potent user problem.",
    "Use the 'Once Upon a Time' storytelling framework to simplify complex product visions into a narrative everyone can understand.",
    "Practice 'Catfooding' alongside Dogfooding: don't just use your own product, religiously use your competitors' products to build product sense.",
    "Maintain a living 'Top 10 Things You Should Know' document that lists the most critical user problems and tech debt, rather than relying solely on new research for every cycle.",
    "Structure strategy documents as 'Insights -> Strategy -> Big Rocks' within a strict 2-page limit to force clarity.",
    "Evangelize vision in concentric circles: start with the core team, move to stakeholders, and finally present to leadership.",
    "Product management is the art of Clarity (removing noise) and Conviction (making the bet)."
