  "episodeSummary": "Lulu Cheng Meservey shares her contrarian approach to communications, emphasizing the need for startups to take risks and 'go direct' rather than relying on traditional media. She breaks down tactical frameworks for making ideas spread, including finding 'cultural erogenous zones' and using physics-based models to maximize messaging impact.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Lulu Cheng Meservey 分享了她反传统的公关传播方法论，强调初创公司应勇于承担风险并建立“直达用户（Go Direct）”的渠道，而非单纯依赖传统媒体。她详细拆解了让观点广泛传播的战术框架，包括寻找受众的“文化敏感带”，以及利用物理学模型最大化信息传播的压强。",
