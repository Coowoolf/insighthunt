  "episodeSummary": "Jason Lemkin shares a masterclass on building a B2B sales engine from scratch, debunking common myths about hiring VPs of Sales too early. He details exact frameworks for hiring the first two representatives, structuring early compensation, and managing the tension between product roadmaps and sales requests.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jason Lemkin 分享了从零构建 B2B 销售引擎的大师级课程，揭穿了过早招聘销售副总裁（VP of Sales）的常见误区。他详细阐述了招聘首批销售代表的具体框架、早期薪酬结构设计，以及如何管理产品路线图与销售需求之间的张力。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Founders must close the first 10 customers personally; you are an 'A+ Middler' even if you can't prospect or close perfectly.",
    "Hire two sales reps initially (not one) to enable A/B testing of performance and talent.",
    "Do not hire a VP of Sales until you have two reps consistently hitting quota; hiring a VP to find product-market fit is a guaranteed failure.",
    "The first hires should be 'pirates' and 'romantics' who love the product, not necessarily veterans from big corporations like Salesforce.",
    "Implement a 'Sales Budget' for product development (e.g., 10% of story points) to force Sales to force-rank their own feature requests.",
    "Avoid hiring sales leaders whose last product was easier to sell; look for those who sold technically complex products or were #4 in a competitive market."
