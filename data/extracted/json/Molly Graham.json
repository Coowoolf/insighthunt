  "episodeSummary": "Molly Graham shares her battle-tested frameworks for navigating hyper-growth, drawn from her experiences at Facebook and Google. She discusses how leaders must scale themselves by 'giving away their Legos,' how to diagnose team issues using the 'Waterline Model,' and provides actionable rules for goal setting and career management.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Molly Graham 分享了她在 Facebook 和 Google 积累的应对超高速增长的实战框架。她探讨了管理者如何通过“分发乐高积木”实现自我迭代，如何利用“水位线模型”诊断团队问题，并提供了关于目标制定和职业生涯管理的实操法则。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To scale with a company, you must constantly hire yourself out of your current job ('Give away your Legos').",
    "80% of team problems are structural (goals/roles), not personality-driven; fix structure before blaming people.",
    "No company needs more than 3 goals; one goal must always be the tie-breaker in prioritization.",
    "Strategy should hurt; if you aren't making painful trade-offs, you aren't prioritizing.",
    "Don't grow headcount by more than 100% in a year; it creates chaos and inefficiency.",
    "Treat escalation as a decision-making tool to unblock teams, not as 'tattling'.",
    "Career growth is often a J-Curve (jumping off a cliff/struggling) rather than a linear set of stairs."
