  "episodeSummary": "Austin Hay demystifies the complex world of Marketing Technology (MarTech), explaining how to scale systems from startup to enterprise. He discusses the critical distinction between marketing ops and martech, offers a future-proof data schema for attribution in a post-cookie world, and shares mental models for decision-making and build/buy strategies.",

      "commonMistakes": "Jumping straight to the 'System' (e.g., granting permissions or buying software) without understanding the context.",
      "quote": "I like to first say what's the problem? Who are the people involved and what system does it impact? Usually people just jump straight to the system.",
