    "title": "Former Head of Marketing at Notion / Head of Content at First Round Capital",
    "company": "Notion / First Round Capital",
    "background": "Camille was the first marketing hire at Notion, where she architected their legendary community-led growth strategy. Previously, she built the First Round Review from scratch, setting the industry standard for VC content marketing, and worked in comms at early Tesla alongside Elon Musk.",
    "background_zh": "Camille 是 Notion 的首位市场成员，主导构建了其传奇般的社区驱动增长策略。在此之前，她从 0 到 1 打造了 First Round Review，确立了 VC 内容营销的行业标杆。她早年还曾在特斯拉负责传播业务，与 Elon Musk 并肩共事。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "In this deep dive into organic growth, Camille Ricketts deconstructs how Notion used community and content to achieve ubiquity without massive ad spend. She articulates the difference between community-led growth and standard support, providing frameworks for when to invest in ambassadors versus customer advisory boards. Additionally, she applies product thinking to content marketing, explaining how to achieve 'Content-Market Fit' by solving deep user anxieties rather than just publishing generic articles.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Stop measuring Community ROI immediately; instead, track 'net new visitors' to the website as a proxy for brand discovery and intent.",
    "Identify your product's 'Atomic Unit of Sharing' (e.g., Notion templates, Figma files) to determine if community-led growth is viable for you.",
    "For content marketing, prioritize 'Painkillers' (solving anxiety, confusion, or loneliness) over 'Vitamins' (nice-to-know information).",
    "Do not scale communities indefinitely; cap monthly intake (e.g., 20 people/month) to preserve culture and intimacy.",
    "Incentivize ambassadors with access and status (early features, direct lines to product teams) rather than transactional cash payments.",
    "Use 'The Big Break' PR strategy: Focus on landing one definitive story in a major outlet (like WSJ) to establish credibility, rather than constant low-level noise.",
    "If you are Pre-PMF and Enterprise, build a Customer Advisory Board, not a mass community.",
    "Treat content creation like product development: invest ~10 hours per piece to ensure it clears the quality bar of the internet."
