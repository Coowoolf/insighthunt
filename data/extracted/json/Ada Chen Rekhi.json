  "episodeSummary": "Ada Chen Rekhi joins Lenny to discuss career strategy, decision-making frameworks, and the nuances of leadership. She introduces the 'Curiosity Loop' for gathering contextual advice, breaks down the 'Explore and Exploit' phases of career development, and shares how to cultivate a 'Values-Based Inner Scorecard' to combat the ego monster. The conversation also touches on navigating Silicon Valley as a woman and the importance of 'eating your vegetables' in skill acquisition.",
