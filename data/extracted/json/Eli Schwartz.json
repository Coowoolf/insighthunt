He is the author of 'Product-Led SEO' and is known for challenging traditional keyword-centric approaches in favor of strategic, user-centric product development.",
    "background_zh": "Eli 是一位深耕 SEO 领域的知名增长顾问，曾为 SurveyMonkey、Tinder、WordPress 和 Coinbase 等头部企业提供战略指导。作为《Product-Led SEO》一书作者，他以挑战传统“关键词导向”的打法而闻名，主张通过战略性、用户导向的产品开发来驱动增长。"

  "episodeSummary": "In this deep dive into the changing landscape of search, Eli Schwartz argues that the rise of AI and LLMs is shifting SEO from a marketing tactic to a product discipline. He explains why traditional 'content mills' are dying, why most SaaS companies waste money on SEO, and how to treat search traffic as a user acquisition channel that requires product thinking rather than just keyword stuffing.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat SEO as a product, not a marketing tactic: Requires PMs, engineers, and designers, not just content writers.",
    "Most B2B SaaS companies should not do SEO: If your product requires a sales demo or committee decision, top-of-funnel search traffic rarely converts to revenue.",
    "Stop tracking traffic as a KPI: Traffic is often a vanity metric; focus exclusively on conversions (MQLs, signups, revenue).",
    "AI Overviews eat the top of the funnel: Users now get answers to 'discovery' questions directly in search results; the opportunity now lies in mid-funnel 'solution' searches.",
    "Link building is actually brand building: Buying links is dead; you must create a product or brand story so compelling that reputable sites mention you organically.",
    "Programmatic SEO requires unique user intent: Do not auto-generate thousands of pages (e.g., by zip code) unless a user actually has a specific need for that slice of data."

      "summary": "A strategic approach that treats SEO pages as product features rather than marketing blog posts. It aligns the creation of search assets directly with user pain points and the product's value proposition.",
      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Be the User: Ignore keyword tools initially. Hypothesize what specific problem a user has that they would type into a search bar.",
        "Step 2: Define the Asset: Determine if the solution requires a tool, a template, a programmatic page, or editorial content.",
        "Step 3: Build for the Mid-Funnel: Create assets that bridge the gap between 'I have a problem' (which AI answers) and 'I need this specific solution' (your product).",
        "Step 4: Treat as Product: Assign engineering, design, and PM resources to build a high-quality user experience, not just text on a page."

      "realWorldExample": "Tinder realized users weren't searching for 'dating app' content, but for solutions to loneliness in specific cities. They built programmatic pages for 'Dating in [City]' that solved the loneliness problem by offering the app as the solution.",

        "第三步：瞄准漏斗中层：打造承接转化的资产，填补从“我遇到了问题”（AI 已解决）到“我需要特定解决方案”（你的产品）之间的缺口。",

      "principles_zh": [
        "步骤 1：分析用户旅程。用户搜索后是否会立即在线下单或转化？如果转化路径依赖销售介入，SEO 的 ROI 通常较低。",
