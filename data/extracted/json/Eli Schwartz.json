    "background": "Eli is a renowned growth advisor specializing in SEO, having guided strategies for major companies like SurveyMonkey, Tinder, WordPress, and Coinbase. He is the author of 'Product-Led SEO' and is known for challenging traditional keyword-centric approaches in favor of strategic, user-centric product development."

  "episodeSummary": "In this deep dive into the changing landscape of search, Eli Schwartz argues that the rise of AI and LLMs is shifting SEO from a marketing tactic to a product discipline. He explains why traditional 'content mills' are dying, why most SaaS companies waste money on SEO, and how to treat search traffic as a user acquisition channel that requires product thinking rather than just keyword stuffing.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat SEO as a product, not a marketing tactic: Requires PMs, engineers, and designers, not just content writers.",
    "Most B2B SaaS companies should not do SEO: If your product requires a sales demo or committee decision, top-of-funnel search traffic rarely converts to revenue.",
    "Stop tracking traffic as a KPI: Traffic is often a vanity metric; focus exclusively on conversions (MQLs, signups, revenue).",
    "AI Overviews eat the top of the funnel: Users now get answers to 'discovery' questions directly in search results; the opportunity now lies in mid-funnel 'solution' searches.",
    "Link building is actually brand building: Buying links is dead; you must create a product or brand story so compelling that reputable sites mention you organically.",
    "Programmatic SEO requires unique user intent: Do not auto-generate thousands of pages (e.g., by zip code) unless a user actually has a specific need for that slice of data."

      "summary": "A strategic approach that treats SEO pages as product features rather than marketing blog posts. It aligns the creation of search assets directly with user pain points and the product's value proposition.",
      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Be the User: Ignore keyword tools initially. Hypothesize what specific problem a user has that they would type into a search bar.",
        "Step 2: Define the Asset: Determine if the solution requires a tool, a template, a programmatic page, or editorial content.",
        "Step 3: Build for the Mid-Funnel: Create assets that bridge the gap between 'I have a problem' (which AI answers) and 'I need this specific solution' (your product).",
        "Step 4: Treat as Product: Assign engineering, design, and PM resources to build a high-quality user experience, not just text on a page."

      "quote": "Think of SEO as a product. The product managers are the people that should be thinking about this SEO question because it's a product question.",
      "realWorldExample": "Tinder realized users weren't searching for 'dating app' content, but for solutions to loneliness in specific cities. They built programmatic pages for 'Dating in [City]' that solved the loneliness problem by offering the app as the solution."

      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Analyze the User Journey: Does the user buy/convert online immediately after searching? If it requires a sales call, SEO is likely low ROI.",
        "Step 2: Check for Problem Awareness: Are users actually searching for the problem you solve? You cannot SEO for a problem users don't know they have.",
        "Step 3: Calculate True Cost: Sum the cost of agencies, internal PM time, engineering support, and CMS maintenance.",
        "Step 4: Compare Opportunity Cost: Would the same budget yield higher ROI in paid ads, trade shows, or influencer marketing?"

      "whenToUse": "During annual planning or immediately after raising a Series A/B to determine resource allocation.",
      "commonMistakes": "Assuming SEO is 'free' traffic and failing to account for the significant time and engineering cost required to do it right.",
      "quote": "If you can't answer the question about what is it that someone's going to do a search on, then don't do SEO.",
      "realWorldExample": "A gardening SaaS company was advised to spend $15k/month on content SEO. Eli analyzed their journey and realized their customers came from trade shows. They shifted the budget to booths ($10k each) which yielded immediate, high-intent leads."

      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Identify Aggregatable Data: Find structured data (proprietary or public) that is valuable when combined (e.g., home values + school districts).",

        "Step 3: Design the 'View': Create a template that acts as a dashboard or tool for that specific query, not just a wall of text.",

      "quote": "Programmatic is the right solution when there's scale and when there's a user use case. If there is not, you create scale for nothing.",
      "realWorldExample": "TripAdvisor didn't write articles for every hotel. They aggregated location, amenities, and user reviews into a single programmatic page for every hotel, creating value that no single editorial piece could match."
