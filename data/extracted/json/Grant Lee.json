  "episodeSummary": "Grant Lee shares the counter-intuitive journey of building Gamma to $100M ARR profitably with a small team. He discusses how they pivoted from a vanity-metric launch to true product-market fit by obsessing over the first 30 seconds of user experience. The conversation covers their unique 'echo chamber' influencer strategy, the 'One Egg' onboarding framework, and how they use 24-hour prototyping loops to maintain velocity.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Grant Lee 分享了 Gamma 如何以小团队规模，在保持盈利的同时实现 1 亿美元 ARR 的非传统增长之路。他讲述了团队如何通过死磕用户体验的“前30秒”，从早期的虚荣指标陷阱转向真正的 PMF（产品市场匹配）。对话深入探讨了他们独特的“回声室”红人营销策略、“单枚鸡蛋”引导框架，以及如何利用 24 小时原型迭代闭环来保持极高的产品迭代速度。",

    "True PMF is defined by organic word-of-mouth (WOM) driving >50% of growth, not just launch spikes.",
    "The 'First 30 Seconds' determines retention; assume users are lazy, vain, and selfish.",
    "Founder-led influencer marketing requires personal onboarding of creators to ensure authentic storytelling.",
    "Micro-influencers in specific niches (e.g., teachers) create 'echo chambers' that outperform broad celebrity endorsements.",
    "Brand is performance marketing; investing in brand DNA early enables scalable ad creative later.",
    "Use 'Strong Opinions, Weakly Held' with rapid 24-hour prototyping loops to validate ideas before building fully.",
    "Building a 'GPT Wrapper' is viable if you solve deep workflow problems with orchestration across multiple models."
