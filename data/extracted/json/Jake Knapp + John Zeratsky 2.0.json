They are best-selling authors of 'Sprint' and 'Make Time', and now run Character Capital, a venture firm that helps early-stage startups find product-market fit using their sprint methodologies.",
    "background_zh": "Jake和John是著名的“设计冲刺”（Design Sprint）流程的创造者，该方法论诞生于Google和Google Ventures。他们是畅销书《设计冲刺》和《高能要事》（Make Time）的作者，目前经营Character Capital风投公司，利用冲刺方法论帮助早期初创企业寻找PMF（产品市场匹配）。"

  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Jake and John introduce the 'Foundation Sprint', a 10-hour framework designed to precede the classic Design Sprint. They detail how founders can define their core value proposition, differentiate from competitors using the 'Loserville' matrix, and structure a 'Founding Hypothesis' before writing a single line of code. The conversation covers specific techniques for decision-making and validation to avoid the 'generic AI product' trap.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Jake和John介绍了“基础冲刺”（Foundation Sprint），这是一个为期10小时、用于前置经典“设计冲刺”的框架。他们详细讲解了创始人如何在写第一行代码前，定义核心价值主张、利用“失败区”矩阵进行差异化定位，并构建“创始假设”。对话涵盖了具体的决策和验证技巧，旨在帮助团队避免开发出同质化的AI产品。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Clear your calendar for 10 hours (two days) to align the core team on strategy before building.",
    "Avoid group brainstorms; use 'Note and Vote' (working alone together) to prevent groupthink and speed up decisions.",
    "Differentiation must be based on a promise to the customer, not just technology or market opportunity.",
    "Use the 'Founding Hypothesis' template to articulate exactly who you are serving, how you win, and your backup plan.",
    "Speed in building can be dangerous; moving fast in the wrong direction (especially with AI) leads to generic products.",
    "Validate your hypothesis using a 'Scorecard' (Red/Yellow/Green) after customer interviews, not just gut feeling.",
    "Product positioning and the product itself should be developed in parallel, not sequentially."
