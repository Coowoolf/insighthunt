  "episodeSummary": "Jonathan Lowenhar joins Lenny to dismantle the myth that founders naturally know how to be CEOs, arguing that while being a founder is a state of being, being a CEO is a craft that must be learned. He introduces the \"Magic Box Paradigm\" for successfully selling startups by selling a future fantasy rather than past metrics, and shares actionable frameworks for hiring, go-to-market strategy, and overcoming common CEO failure modes.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jonathan Lowenhar 在节目中打破了“创始人天生就是 CEO”的迷思，他提出“创始人”是一种状态，而“CEO”是一门需要学习的手艺。他详细介绍了用于成功出售初创公司的“魔盒范式”（Magic Box Paradigm），即通过推销未来的幻想而非过去的数据来实现退出。此外，他还分享了关于招聘、GTM（进入市场）策略以及克服常见 CEO 失败模式的实战框架。",
