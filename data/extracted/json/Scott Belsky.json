  "episodeSummary": "Scott Belsky shares his deep product philosophy, focusing on the psychology of the 'First Mile' of user experience and the importance of editing features down to the essentials. He also discusses navigating the 'Messy Middle' of company building, how to maintain team morale through volatility, and provides a forward-looking perspective on how AI will collapse the organizational stack and empower product builders.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Scott Belsky 分享了他深刻的产品哲学，重点探讨了用户体验“首英里（First Mile）”的心理学机制，以及精简产品功能的重要性。他还讨论了如何度过创业过程中“混乱的中程（Messy Middle）”，如何在动荡中维持团队士气，并前瞻性地分析了 AI 将如何“压扁”组织层级并赋能产品构建者。",

    "Users are lazy, vain, and selfish in the first 30 seconds; build for this psychology.",
    "Optimize for the problems you want to have (users asking for features) rather than building everything upfront.",
    "Kill features to increase velocity on the core metric (The Behance Example).",
    "To survive the 'Messy Middle', short-circuit the reward system with micro-milestones.",
    "Product sense = Empathy + Psychological understanding of human tendencies.",
    "AI will allow PMs and designers to explore 10x the surface area of possibilities.",
    "Great product UX answers three questions: How did I get here? What do I do now? Where do I go next?"
