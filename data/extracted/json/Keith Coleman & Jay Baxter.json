    "background": "Keith Coleman is a veteran product leader who previously led Consumer Product at Twitter before founding the Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) team. Jay Baxter is the founding machine learning engineer who architected the bridging-based algorithm that powers the system.",
    "background_zh": "Keith Coleman 是资深产品负责人，曾领导 Twitter 的消费者产品部门，随后创立了 Community Notes（前身为 Birdwatch）团队。Jay Baxter 是该项目的创始机器学习工程师，架构了驱动该系统的“跨阵营共识”算法。"

  "episodeSummary": "Keith Coleman and Jay Baxter reveal the inner workings of Community Notes, X's decentralized fact-checking system that has revolutionized online moderation. They discuss the \"Bridging-based\" algorithm that prioritizes consensus across polarized groups, the \"Thermal\" team structure that allows them to ship fast with a lean team, and the counter-intuitive product principles—like anonymity and open-sourcing algorithms—that built user trust.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Keith Coleman 和 Jay Baxter 揭秘了 Community Notes（社区笔记）的内部运作机制，这是 X 平台革命性的去中心化事实核查系统。他们深入探讨了优先考虑跨群体共识的“跨阵营”算法、允许小团队快速交付的“Thermal”组织架构，以及那些建立用户信任的反直觉产品原则（如匿名机制和算法开源）。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Community Notes uses a 'Bridging-based ranking' algorithm, not majority rule, requiring agreement from users who typically disagree.",
    "The 'Thermal' team model operates like a startup within a big corp: small autonomous teams, no middle management, and direct lines to executive decision-makers.",
    "Paradoxically, anonymous contributors are more likely to cross partisan lines and agree on facts than those using real names.",
    "Open sourcing the algorithm and data was critical for trust; users can audit and replicate the system's decisions.",
    "Community Notes reduces the virality of misinformation by 50-60% without actually deleting the content.",
    "Launch strategy: Prove viability at every step (Mockups -> MTurk -> Pilot -> Scale) to overcome internal skepticism."
