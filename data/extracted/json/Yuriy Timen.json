  "episodeSummary": "In this tactical deep dive, Yuriy Timen breaks down growth strategies for B2C and B2B subscription products. He discusses how to choose between Paid, Viral, and SEO channels based on business models, the shifting landscape of attribution in a post-iOS14 world, and why 'growth at all costs' is being replaced by efficiency.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "本期节目深度解析了 B2C 和 B2B 订阅产品的增长策略。Yuriy Timen 探讨了如何根据商业模式在付费投放、病毒式传播和 SEO 之间做出选择，分析了后 iOS14 时代归因逻辑的演变，以及为何“不惜一切代价增长”的模式正被“高效增长”所取代。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Identify your primary growth engine based on product DNA: High LTV supports Paid, Network Effects support Virality, unique data/content supports SEO.",
    "Do not diversify channels too early; apply the 80/20 rule and exhaust your main channel before spreading resources thin.",
    "For SEO to work, you need at least 2 of 3 angles: Unique Editorial, Programmatic (templates), or Unique Data.",
    "In the current economic climate, efficiency and payback periods (<6 months) matter more than top-line growth.",
    "Click-based attribution is dead; modern growth teams must use Media Mix Modeling (MMM) and Incrementality Testing.",
    "Onboarding optimization is consistently the highest leverage activity for improving activation and retention.",
    "Don't dismiss TikTok; it is becoming effective for older demographics and B2B/Prosumer brands."
