  "episodeSummary": "Maggie Crowley discusses the tangible traits that separate great product managers from the rest, emphasizing the importance of simplifying complexity and \"carrying the water\" (doing unglamorous work). She shares a detailed framework for writing product strategy documents that align teams, breaks down how to write effective one-pagers, and offers contrarian views on why being \"data-driven\" can sometimes be a red flag.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Maggie Crowley 探讨了区分卓越产品经理与普通产品经理的具体特质，强调了简化复杂问题以及“挑水担柴”（处理非光鲜工作）的重要性。她分享了一套详细的产品战略文档框架以帮助团队对齐目标，解析了如何撰写高效的一页纸需求文档（One-Pager），并提出了关于为何过分强调“数据驱动”可能是一个危险信号的独特见解。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Great PMs simplify complexity: find the one thing that matters and stick with it.",
    "Follow up on results: check metrics 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months post-launch.",
    "\"Carry the water\": PMs must do the unglamorous work (QA, support, sales calls) to fill gaps.",
    "A product strategy doc is primarily for the PM to ensure their own logic is sound.",
    "When writing specs/PRDs, the most important question is \"Why does this matter NOW?\"",
    "Being overly \"data-driven\" can be a red flag for a lack of product intuition.",
    "Avoid rewrites/redesigns; they almost always take longer than expected and fail."
