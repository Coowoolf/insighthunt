    "background": "Jen Abel is a B2B sales expert specializing in helping early-stage startups transition from founder-led sales to scalable enterprise sales models. She focuses on the critical $1M to $10M ARR journey.",
    "background_zh": "Jen Abel 是 B2B 销售领域的专家，专注于帮助早期初创企业从“创始人销售”向可扩展的“企业级销售”模式转型。她特别擅长指导企业跨越从 100 万到 1000 万美元 ARR（年度经常性收入）的关键增长阶段。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Jen Abel discusses the critical transition from founder-led sales to building an enterprise sales engine ($1M-$10M ARR). She challenges conventional wisdom by arguing that the \"mid-market\" doesn't exist, advocates for selling \"vision\" over \"problems\" to Tier 1 logos, and details how to leverage services to secure six-figure contracts early.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jen Abel 探讨了初创企业从创始人销售向企业级销售引擎转型的关键期（1M-10M ARR）。她挑战了传统观念，提出“中端市场不存在”的论点，主张向头部客户销售“愿景”而非单纯解决“问题”，并详细介绍了如何利用服务（Services）作为切入点来尽早拿下六位数的高额合同。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The mid-market is a trap; choose between SMB (marketing-led) or Enterprise (sales-led).",
    "Stop selling to problems; sell to the 'Gap' and 'Alpha' (competitive advantage).",
    "Anchor pricing at $75k-$150k immediately to be taken seriously by enterprises.",
    "Start with Tier 1 logos (e.g., Walmart) as they are often the true early adopters seeking innovation.",
    "Use services and manual work as a 'Trojan Horse' to enter enterprise accounts before full software adoption.",
    "Hire salespeople who can 'cosplay the founder' rather than traditional VP of Sales types."

      "summary": "Instead of selling a solution to a specific pain point (problem selling), founders must sell the 'Alpha'—the competitive advantage or future state the client will achieve (vision casting).
