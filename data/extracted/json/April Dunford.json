  "episodeSummary": "April Dunford joins Lenny to demystify product positioning, explaining that it is not just marketing fluff but a foundational business concept. She breaks down her 5-component methodology for deriving positioning, discusses the difference between brand, messaging, and positioning, and offers specific advice for early-stage startups versus growth-stage companies regarding how tight their positioning should be. She also clarifies the confusion between segmentation and personas in B2B sales.",

        "Don't start with 'Why do people love us?' (Too subjective).",
