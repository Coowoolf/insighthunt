  "episodeSummary": "In this tactical masterclass, Jason Feifer demystifies the black box of media relations for startups, arguing that founders often misunderstand the fundamental incentives of journalists. He outlines a three-step framework for getting press—Preparation, Targeting, and Pitching—and explains why 'success stories' rarely get published while 'problem-solving narratives' do. The conversation covers how to identify the right journalists (including the value of freelancers), how to craft emails that get opened, and alternative strategies for businesses that aren't naturally newsworthy.",
