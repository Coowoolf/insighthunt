  "episodeSummary": "Jake and John challenge the traditional definition of productivity, arguing that it's not about speed or efficiency, but about intention. They introduce the 'Make Time' framework to help leaders escape the 'Busy Bandwagon' and 'Infinity Pools' of distraction, focusing instead on creating meaningful daily highlights.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jake 和 John 挑战了对生产力的传统定义，认为生产力不在于速度或效率，而在于意图（Intention）。他们介绍了“生时间”（Make Time）框架，帮助管理者摆脱“忙碌跟风”和分散注意力的“无尽泳池”，转而专注于创造每日的“高光时刻”。",
