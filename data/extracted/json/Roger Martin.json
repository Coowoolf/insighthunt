  "episodeSummary": "Roger Martin demystifies strategy by breaking it down into a practical set of choices rather than a theoretical exercise. He introduces the 'Strategy Choice Cascade,' explains why most companies fail by 'playing to play' instead of 'playing to win,' and offers a tactical 'Betterment' approach for continuous strategic improvement.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Roger Martin 将战略从理论练习拆解为一系列实用的决策选择，揭开了战略的神秘面纱。他介绍了“战略选择级联”框架，解释了为什么大多数公司因“为了参与而参与”而非“为了赢”而失败，并提出了一种战术性的“持续优化（Betterment）”方法，以实现战略的持续改进。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Strategy is not about planning resources; it is an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action.",
    "You must choose to either be the low-cost leader or the differentiated player; anything else is 'playing to play' and leads to failure.",
    "The 'Where to Play' and 'How to Win' choices must be tightly linked; you cannot win everywhere.",
    "True competitive advantage (moats) comes from capabilities that competitors either 'can't' replicate or 'won't' replicate due to their existing business model.",
    "Don't strive for perfection immediately; use the 'Betterment' approach to identify a gap between current and desired results and make choices to close it."
