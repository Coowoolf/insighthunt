  "episodeSummary": "Annie Pearl discusses Calendly's transition from a pure PLG motion to adding a sales-led enterprise motion, the cultural shifts required for that change, and how to structure product teams and planning processes at scale. She details frameworks for strategy (Playing to Win), execution (Phased Development), and decision-making (OPA meetings).",

      "name": "Playing to Win Framework",
      "category": "Strategy",
      "summary": "A strategic framework used to create focus by making an integrated set of choices about where the product will compete and how it will succeed, rather than trying to be everything to everyone.",
      "principles": [
        "Strategy is an integrated set of choices.",
        "You must explicitly define where you will play (markets, segments, personas).",
        "You must define how you will win (value proposition for that target).",
        "Focus wisely: saying 'no' is as important as saying 'yes'."
      ],
      "problemItSolves": "Prevents product teams from trying to serve too many horizontal use cases, which leads to dilution of value and difficulty in prioritization.",
      "whenToUse": "When defining long-term product strategy or when a company needs to pivot from a broad horizontal focus to specific vertical/segment depth.",
      "commonMistakes": "Skipping the 'Where to Play' step and trying to build features for every user type (e.g., building Venmo integration for solopreneurs when the strategy is Enterprise Sales).",
      "quote": "Strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose.",
      "realWorldExample": "Calendly used this to shift focus from a broad horizontal tool for everyone to specifically targeting Sales, Recruiting, and CS teams in the Enterprise (Horizon 2).",

        "Only commit to dates for work that is fully scoped.",
        "Discovery is a commitment to research, not to build.",

      "commonMistakes": "Committing to a launch date before the problem has been validated or the solution designed.",
      "quote": "We've gotten a lot better at making the commitments around the work that's right in front of us versus making a commitment around a project six months out.",
