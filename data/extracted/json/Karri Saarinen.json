  },
  "episodeSummary": "Karri Saarinen discusses how Linear defies conventional startup wisdom by operating with almost no product managers, ignoring A/B testing, and avoiding metrics-based goals. He details the 'Linear Method' of building opinionated software, their unique 'work trial' hiring process, and how they utilized a year-long private beta with cohort-based onboarding to achieve product-market fit.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Karri Saarinen 分享了 Linear 如何通过反传统的经营方式获得成功：极少聘用产品经理、不做 A/B 测试、不设定基于指标的功能目标。他详细阐述了构建“有观点”软件的“Linear 方法论”，其独特的“带薪试岗”招聘流程，以及如何利用长达一年的分批次内测策略来实现 PMF（产品市场匹配）。",

    "Design matters disproportionately more in mature, crowded markets as a differentiator.",
    "Avoid 'flexible' software; build 'opinionated' tools that define the workflow for the user.",

    "Hire engineers with strong product sensibility to reduce the need for dedicated PMs.",
    "Use 'Paid Work Trials' instead of standard interviews to test actual fit and output.",
    "Stay in private beta longer to fix issues via small user cohorts before scaling.",
    "Focus on the 'Main Quest' (core value) and ruthlessly cut 'Side Quests' (distractions)."
