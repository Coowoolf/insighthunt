  "episodeSummary": "Nikita Miller shares her evolution from focusing purely on outcomes to recognizing the vital importance of output and velocity. She details actionable frameworks for defining cross-functional roles, embedding data scientists into product teams, and managing distributed workforces effectively.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Nikita Miller 分享了她的管理理念演进：从单纯关注“结果（Outcome）”转变为重新重视“产出（Output）”和交付速度的重要性。她详细介绍了定义跨职能角色、将数据科学家嵌入产品团队以及有效管理分布式团队的实战框架。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "While outcomes are critical, output is a leading indicator; teams that don't ship frequently get fewer 'shots on goal'.",
    "Define clear 'social contracts' for roles and responsibilities between Product, Design, Engineering, and Data to prevent friction.",
    "Data scientists should be embedded in product teams (quads) rather than treated as a centralized service bureau.",
    "For distributed teams, solve 'gnarly' strategic problems by meeting in-person for intense 48-hour summits.",
    "The PM role is swinging back towards being more technical; understanding data and engineering constraints is increasingly required.",
    "Use the question 'What are you optimizing for?' to force alignment on trade-offs across short, medium, and long-term horizons."
