  "episodeSummary": "Howie Liu discusses the necessity of 'refounding' a decade-old SaaS company in the AI era, emphasizing the shift of CEOs back to 'Individual Contributor' (IC) roles. He details Airtable's organizational split into 'Fast Thinking' (AI innovation) and 'Slow Thinking' (infrastructure) groups, and explains why product leaders must prioritize 'vibes' and hands-on usage over rigid evaluations in the early stages of AI development.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Howie Liu 探讨了在 AI 时代对一家十年 SaaS 公司进行“二次创业”的必要性，强调 CEO 需回归“独立贡献者”（IC）角色的趋势。他详细介绍了 Airtable 如何将组织拆分为“快思考”（AI 创新）和“慢思考”（基础设施）两个团队，并解释了为何在 AI 开发早期，产品负责人必须优先考虑“体感”和亲手实践，而非依赖僵化的评估指标。",
