    "background": "Dylan Field is the co-founder and CEO of Figma, the collaborative interface design tool that revolutionized how product teams work. A former Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University, Dylan has led Figma from a browser-based experiment to a multi-billion dollar platform that is now the industry standard for UI/UX design.",
    "background_zh": "Dylan Field 是 Figma 的联合创始人兼 CEO，Figma 作为一款协作式界面设计工具，彻底颠覆了产品团队的协作模式。作为曾经的泰尔奖学金（Thiel Fellowship）得主及布朗大学辍学生，Dylan 带领 Figma 从一个基于浏览器的实验性项目，发展成为估值数十亿美元的平台，并确立了其作为 UI/UX 设计行业标准的地位。"

  "episodeSummary": "Recorded live at Figma Config, this episode explores the intersection of intuition, design, and operational rigor. Dylan Field deconstructs how he operationalizes 'product taste' not as magic, but as a hypothesis generation engine, and discusses the relentless battle against product entropy. He also shares the specific early-stage growth tactics used to bootstrap Figma's network effects and offers a pragmatic framework for balancing quality, features, and deadlines.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat product intuition as a hypothesis generator rather than a divine directive; use it to spawn ideas that must then be debated and validated with data.",
    "Fight product entropy by adhering to the principle of 'Irreducible Complexity': adding more features often reduces system coherence (1+1=1.5).",
    "Apply the 'Quality, Features, Deadline' constraint triangle for every launch—you can only pick two, and for software, you can iterate on features but should hesitate to compromise quality.",
    "Adopt the 'Minimally Awesome Product' mindset over MVP; early versions must meet a quality bar that inspires users, even if feature sets are limited.",
    "Use network analysis for early growth: identify the 'central nodes' (influencers) in your target market and approach them for feedback/mentorship rather than sales.",
    "Product management's core value is creating frameworks with a point of view that align cross-functional teams toward a shared destination.",
    "Design is defined as 'art applied to problem solving'—it must balance unique expression with utilitarian user needs to have soul."

        "Step 4: Winnowing - Narrow down the options to a single 'working hypothesis' based on the debate.",
