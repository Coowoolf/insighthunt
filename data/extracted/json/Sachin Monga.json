  "episodeSummary": "Sachin Monga discusses Substack's evolution from a simple tool for writers into a powerful subscription network, highlighting the legendary 'Recommendations' feature that drives 70% of growth. He contrasts product management at hyper-growth startups versus established giants like Facebook, emphasizing the importance of user agency over algorithmic feeds. The conversation covers how to build trust with founders, the 'Build with Writers' product philosophy, and the future of the creator economy.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Sachin Monga 探讨了 Substack 如何从单一写作工具进化为强大的订阅网络，重点解析了贡献了 70% 增长的传奇功能——“推荐机制”。他对照了 Facebook 等大厂与高速增长初创企业在产品管理上的差异，强调了“用户主权”优于算法推荐的产品哲学。对话还涵盖了如何与创始人建立信任、“与创作者共建”的产品开发模式，以及创作者经济的未来图景。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Prioritize user agency over algorithmic engagement to build long-term trust.",
    "In hyper-growth startups, any process you build will be obsolete in 6 months; focus on improvement velocity rather than perfect structure.",
    "Network effects can be engineered through human curation (Recommendations) rather than just black-box algorithms.",
    "Product leaders in founder-led startups should act as facilitators first to bridge the vision gap between founders and new teams.",
    "Facilitate growth by solving the 'cold start' problem for creators through peer-to-peer recommendations.",
    "Don't worry about audience perception; launch early and iterate, as subscribers are often more forgiving than creators expect."

      "summary": "Instead of a centralized 'People You May Know' algorithm, Substack enables writers to explicitly recommend other newsletters. This leverages the trust readers have in a specific writer to drive high-intent subscriptions to others, creating a viral loop based on human curation rather than machine optimization.",
