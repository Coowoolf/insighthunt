  "episodeSummary": "Andrew Wilkinson shares his evolution from a stressed founder starting 'cool' but difficult businesses to a 'lazy leader' who buys profitable companies and leverages AI. He discusses the 'fish where the fish are' philosophy for startup ideas, his specific AI agent workflows for automating personal and professional tasks, and his profound realization that money does not cure anxiety, advocating for medication and accepting one's nature (like ADHD).",

        "Identify Friction: Recognize tasks that cause procrastination or dread.",
        "Automate First: Use AI agents (e.g., Lindy) to handle repetitive logic (email sorting, scheduling, research).",

      "commonMistakes": "Hiring for potential hoping to 'mold' an employee, or trying to do everything yourself out of a Protestant work ethic.",
      "quote": "I think you really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?",
