  "episodeSummary": "Matt Dixon reveals that 40-60% of qualified deals are lost to 'no decision' rather than competitors, driven by the customer's fear of failure (FOMU) rather than satisfaction with the status quo. He introduces the JOLT framework, a methodology derived from analyzing 2.5 million sales calls, to help teams overcome customer indecision by shifting from dialing up fear (FOMO) to instilling confidence.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Matt Dixon 揭示了一个关键洞察：40-60% 的合格商机并非输给了竞争对手，而是输给了“不做决策”，其根源在于客户的“犯错恐惧”（FOMU）而非对现状的满意。他介绍了基于250万通销售电话分析得出的 JOLT 框架，指导团队如何从利用错失焦虑（FOMO）施压，转变为建立客户信心，从而克服决策瘫痪。",
