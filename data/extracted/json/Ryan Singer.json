  "episodeSummary": "Ryan Singer details the 'Shape Up' methodology, an alternative to traditional Scrum/Agile that focuses on shipping meaningful work by replacing estimates with fixed-time 'appetites'. He explains how to conduct collaborative 'shaping' sessions to de-risk projects before coding begins and how to empower engineering teams by handing over full projects rather than fragmented tickets. The discussion also covers adapting these Basecamp-originated practices to 'real life' companies with different constraints.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Ryan Singer 详细解析了“Shape Up”方法论，这是一种区别于传统 Scrum/Agile 的模式，主张用固定的时间“胃口（Appetites）”取代估算，以确保按时交付有价值的产品。他解释了如何通过协作式的“Shaping（塑造）”会议在代码编写前消除风险，以及如何通过移交完整项目而非零散工单来充分授权工程团队。对话还涵盖了如何将这些源自 Basecamp 的实践调整适应于“现实世界”中具有不同限制条件的公司。",
