  "episodeSummary": "Matt LeMay discusses the critical need for product teams to shift from output-focused 'best practices' to genuine business impact to survive the current layoff climate. He outlines the 'Low Impact Death Spiral' and provides a three-step framework for aligning team goals directly with company success, regardless of organizational dysfunction.",

  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Product teams are increasingly being laid off for doing 'work around the work' rather than driving business critical outcomes.",
    "The 'Low Impact Death Spiral' occurs when teams prioritize cosmetic features over core value, creating complexity that makes future high-impact work impossible.",
    "Team goals should be no more than one mathematical step away from company-level goals.",
    "PMs are not just 'mini-CEOs' responsible for decisions; they are responsible for helping the whole team think like a CEO.",
    "Following agile best practices or having perfect OKRs does not protect you if the company fails commercially.",
    "Constraints (regulations, B2B models, revenue targets) are not blockers; they are the guideposts for product strategy."
