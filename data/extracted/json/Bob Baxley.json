  "episodeSummary": "Bob Baxley discusses the evolution of design, arguing that software is a powerful medium akin to film or music that carries a moral obligation to respect user emotion. He challenges standard startup wisdom by advocating for design to report to engineering, delaying high-fidelity prototyping to avoid the 'Primal Mark' bias, and replacing generic design principles with opinionated 'Tenets' that drive hard decision-making.",
