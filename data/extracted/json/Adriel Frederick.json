    "Innovation teams in large companies must position themselves as core to the mission to avoid organizational rejection.",
    "Diverse teams drastically reduce product development cycles by internalizing global user perspectives, reducing the need for external research on basic cultural nuances.",
    "PMs act as a damping buffer during PR crises, focusing the team on valid product criticisms rather than external noise.",
    "Algorithms require human strategic oversight because they optimize for objectives but lack context on intent, constraints, and long-term effects.",
    "Growth is not just about 'hacks'; it requires grinding on core actions and occasionally investing in massive infrastructure changes ('cannonballs').",
    "Data reveals where a problem exists, but observing the 'marginal user' reveals why it exists."
