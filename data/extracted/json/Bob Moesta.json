  "episodeSummary": "Bob Moesta, co-creator of the Jobs to Be Done framework, joins Lenny to demystify the theory and application of JTBD. Moesta explains that products are hired to solve struggling moments rather than just based on demographics. He details the 'Four Forces of Progress' that drive or inhibit behavior change, outlines a specific 'Causal Interview Protocol' for uncovering deep insights, and breaks down the 'Demand-Side Buying Timeline' to align sales processes with customer psychology. The conversation covers practical examples from Snickers to software like Intercom and Autobooks, emphasizing that understanding the context and outcome is more critical than pain and gain.",
