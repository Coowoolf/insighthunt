    "background": "Elena is widely considered one of the world's leading experts in B2B growth and Product-Led Growth (PLG). She has held executive leadership roles at SurveyMonkey, Miro, Netlify, and Amplitude, specializing in bridging the gap between product self-service and enterprise sales motions.",

  "episodeSummary": "Elena Verna dissects the emerging discipline of Product-Led Sales (PLS), explaining how it acts as a critical bridge between Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Sales-Led Growth (SLG). She details the specific infrastructure, data signals, and organizational accountability required to transform individual user habits into enterprise-level contracts. The conversation moves beyond high-level theory into tactical execution, covering how to define Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs), why Product needs to own pipeline targets, and how to avoid the common trap of spamming users with irrelevant sales outreach.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Product-Led Sales (PLS) is the bridge that converts individual user value (<$10k cap) into enterprise organizational value (>$15k contracts).",
    "Do not confuse a user with a buyer; in PLS, the user usually lacks the permission or budget to buy enterprise plans, so Sales must find the separate economic buyer.",
    "Implement the 'Magic Number 7': A strong PQA signal is often when 7+ users within a single company domain join the platform, indicating network effects.",
    "Product teams must take accountability for pipeline generation (PQA targets), not just feature delivery or engagement metrics.",
    "Avoid 'The Shining' Ax Murderer approach: Do not treat a new sign-up as a sales lead immediately; they are in the 'individual job-to-be-done' phase, not the 'enterprise buying' phase.",
    "Use 'Data-Sales Fit' before automation: Manually verify your PQA logic with a pilot sales rep using spreadsheets before buying expensive PLS software.",
    "Monetization awareness is the lowest hanging fruit; 75% of freemium users are unaware of paid features because designs are rarely reviewed from the 'free user' perspective."

      "summary": "A framework for mapping the narrative journey from a single user's utility to an executive's ROI. It clarifies that Sales' role in PLS is not to explain features, but to translate aggregate individual usage into an organizational capability (e.g., 'better design' becomes 'faster time-to-market').",

        "Define the Enterprise Value Prop: What is the C-level outcome? (e.g., Miro: Increased organizational innovation and productivity).",

      "whenToUse": "When transitioning from pure self-serve PLG to adding a sales motion, or when valid leads are churning because they don't see the value of a 'Corporate' plan.",
