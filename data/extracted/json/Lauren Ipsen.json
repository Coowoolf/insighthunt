    "Don't hire a CPO when you need a 'Head of Product'; title inflation creates misalignment in early-stage startups.",
    "Founders should 'calibrate' what good looks like by networking with top talent even when they aren't actively hiring.",
    "For PM careers, breadth of experience (platform, growth, core product) is more valuable than hyper-specialization for future leadership roles.",
    "The 'Instagram vs. Tagged Photos' analogy: Official references are the curated feed; backchannels are the reality.",
