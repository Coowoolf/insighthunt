  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Melissa Perri breaks down the critical differences between feature shipping and true strategy deployment, highlighting the 'missing middle' that disconnects executives from product teams. She details exactly when scaling companies need to hire a Chief Product Officer (CPO) and defines the emerging role of Product Operations (Product Ops). The conversation provides actionable advice on crafting concrete product visions and restructuring teams to move from output-focused to outcome-focused.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Melissa Perri 深度解析了“堆砌功能”与“战略落地”之间的本质区别，并指出了导致高管层与产品团队脱节的“缺失的中间层”问题。她详细阐述了成长型公司何时应当聘请首席产品官（CPO），并定义了正在兴起的“产品运营（Product Ops）”职能。对话还提供了关于构建具象化产品愿景以及重组团队以从“产出导向”转向“结果导向”的实战建议。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Most organizational issues stem from poor strategy deployment, not lack of training.",
    "The 'Missing Middle' is the gap between high-level company vision and tactical team execution.",
    "A CPO is needed when you move to a multi-product portfolio or complex expansion (approx. $20M+ ARR).",
    "Good product vision defines what you will NOT do, not just what you will do.",
    "Product Ops is essential for scaling data access, user research enablement, and process standardization.",
    "Don't standardize team rituals (like standups); standardize interfaces (roadmaps, reporting)."
