  "episodeSummary": "Amjad Masad joins Lenny to demonstrate Replit's AI Agent, capable of building full-stack applications from simple prompts. They discuss the democratization of software creation, the emergence of AI Computer Interfaces (ACI), and the shifting role of Product Managers from specification-writers to 'Generative' creators who prototype ideas directly. Amjad argues that as execution costs plummet, the primary bottleneck moves from engineering capacity to idea generation.",

      "name": "Amjad's Law of Coding ROI",
      "category": "Strategic Framework",
      "summary": "A heuristic stating that the return on investment (ROI) for learning basic coding skills is doubling every six months. As AI models improve, a small amount of technical knowledge (debugging, reading code, prompting) grants exponentially more power and leverage to the user.",
      "principles": [
        "Learn basic structural understanding over deep syntax.",
        "Focus on debugging and reading code rather than writing from scratch.",
        "Treat AI as a force multiplier: 1 unit of skill × AI = 100 units of output.",
        "Update tooling and prompting techniques every 6 months as models evolve."
      ],
      "problemItSolves": "The hesitation non-technical founders or PMs feel about learning to code, fearing it requires years of study to be useful.",
      "whenToUse": "When deciding how much technical training to invest in or when upskilling a product team.",
      "commonMistakes": "Trying to learn traditional CS curriculums (Git, Algorithms) first instead of AI-native workflows; assuming AI makes coding skills obsolete rather than more leveraged.",
      "quote": "The return on investment for learn to code is doubling every six months... truly six months later, the model started to land that are capable of this.",
      "realWorldExample": "A PM learning enough SQL and Python to fix a database migration error generated by an AI agent, allowing them to ship a prototype without an engineer.",

      "category": "Role Evolution",
      "summary": "A shift in the Product Manager persona driven by AI tools. As the cost of software production drops to near zero, the bottleneck shifts from engineering execution to idea generation. PMs must transition from writing PRDs and managing backlogs to generating working prototypes and iterating on live software.",

      "commonMistakes": "Sticking to rigid roadmaps; relying solely on document-based handoffs; failing to utilize AI to build 'v0' of the product.",
      "quote": "Actually making things is a lot easier. Actually, you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas.",
