    "background": "Jonny Miller is a startup founder (Techstars alum) turned executive coach who specializes in helping high-performing tech professionals cultivate resilience. After experiencing burnout and a personal tragedy, he spent years researching breathwork and nervous system regulation to create evidence-based protocols for emotional mastery.",
    "background_zh": "Jonny Miller 是一位从创业者（Techstars 校友）转型的企业高管教练，专注于帮助科技行业的精英人士培养心理韧性。在经历职业倦怠和个人悲剧后，他投入数年时间研究呼吸法和神经系统调节，开发了一套基于实证的情绪掌控方案。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Jonny Miller deconstructs the physiological roots of anxiety and burnout, arguing that high performers must manage their nervous systems as rigorously as their products. He introduces somatic tools to shift mental states instantly and explains why emotional regulation is a competitive advantage in decision-making.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "在本期节目中，Jonny Miller 解构了焦虑和职业倦怠的生理根源，提出高绩效人士应像管理产品一样严谨地管理自己的神经系统。他介绍了一系列能瞬间转换心理状态的身心学（Somatic）工具，并解释了为何情绪调节能力是决策过程中的核心竞争优势。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Anxiety is often a physiological state first, and a mental narrative second; change the state to change the story.",
    "Burnout signals follow a progression: a feather (subtle), a brick (irritability), and a dump truck (crisis).",
    "Interoception (sensing internal body states) correlates with better decision-making and higher income in trading environments.",
    "Emotional debt accumulates like technical debt; you must complete stress cycles to avoid system failure.",
    "The 4-4-8 breathing technique is a rapid 'bottom-up' intervention to switch off the fight-or-flight response.",
    "High work ethic must be matched by an equally disciplined rest ethic (e.g., NSDR protocols)."

      "summary": "This framework visualizes the escalating feedback loops of the nervous system. The body signals distress in three stages: subtle whispers (feather), painful warnings (brick), and catastrophic failure (dump truck). The goal is to develop the sensitivity to pivot at the 'feather' stage.",
      "summary_zh": "该框架将神经系统的反馈循环可视化为三个升级阶段：身体首先会发出微弱信号（羽毛），接着是痛苦的警告（砖块），最后是灾难性的崩溃（卡车）。核心目标是培养敏锐度，在“羽毛”阶段就进行调整和干预。",
      "principles": [
        "The Feather: Recognize subtle fatigue, slight disengagement, or waking up tired (the feedback is gentle).",
        "The Brick: Acknowledge moderate consequences like snapping at a colleague, emotional volatility, or insomnia (the feedback hurts).",
        "The Dump Truck: Avoid the final stage of total collapse, such as a major health crisis, getting fired, or severe depression (the damage is severe)."
      ],
      "principles_zh": [
        "识别羽毛（Feather）：觉察微小的疲劳感、轻微的投入度下降或晨起时的疲惫（反馈是温和的）。",
        "正视砖块（Brick）：承认中度的后果，如对同事发火、情绪波动大或失眠（反馈是痛苦的）。",

      "summary": "Most professionals try to fix anxiety 'top-down' using logic, but the brain's afferent neurons send more signals from body-to-brain than vice versa.
