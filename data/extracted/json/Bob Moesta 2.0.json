  "episodeSummary": "Bob Moesta demystifies the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework, shifting the focus from product features to the 'struggling moments' that cause customers to hire products. He details the 'Forces of Progress' that drive behavior change, the six-stage timeline of buying (and hiring), and advanced interviewing techniques to uncover hidden causality. The conversation applies these principles to product innovation, sales, and career development, emphasizing that people don't buy products—they hire them to make progress under specific contexts.",
