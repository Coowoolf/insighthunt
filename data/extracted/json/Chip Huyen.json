  "episodeSummary": "In this technical yet practical episode, Chip Huyen dissects the reality of building AI products versus the hype. She argues that success comes not from chasing the newest models, but from mastering 'boring' engineering fundamentals like data preparation, reliable evaluations, and understanding user workflows. The conversation covers technical strategies for RAG and RLHF, organizational shifts required for AI teams, and how to identify high-leverage internal AI use cases.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Stop optimizing for the latest model; most performance gains come from data preparation, prompt engineering, and talking to users.",
    "For RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), data processing (chunking, metadata, hypothetical questions) is significantly more important than which vector database you use.",
    "Implement 'Component-Level Evals' rather than just end-to-end metrics; evaluate intermediate steps like search query generation and document retrieval separately.",
    "Organizational disconnect: Managers often prefer headcount (empire building), while executives prefer AI leverage (efficiency metrics)—you must align incentives to drive adoption.",
    "Senior engineers often get the highest leverage from AI coding tools because they have the 'system thinking' required to guide the AI, whereas juniors may rely on it too heavily without understanding architecture.",
    "Use the 'Frustration Audit' to find internal AI use cases: Look at the last week of work, identify friction points, and build micro-tools to solve them."
