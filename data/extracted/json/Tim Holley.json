    "background": "Tim has been with Etsy for over 10 years, helping grow the platform's Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) from $500 million to over $13 billion. He led the product team through the massive COVID-19 demand surge and the company's cultural pivot in 2017.",
    "background_zh": "Tim 在 Etsy 任职超过10年，曾带领团队将平台交易总额 (GMS) 从 5 亿美元增长至 130 亿美元。他主导了 Etsy 在新冠疫情期间应对需求激增的产品策略，并推动了公司 2017 年的关键文化转型。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Tim Holley discusses Etsy's transformation from a slow, consensus-driven culture to a high-velocity, metric-focused organization. He shares deep insights on managing a two-sided marketplace, including the evolution from supply-first to demand-first strategies, and frameworks for cross-functional collaboration known as the 'Five-Legged Stool'.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Tim Holley 深入探讨了 Etsy 如何从注重共识的慢节奏文化转型为以指标为导向的高效组织。他分享了管理双边市场的核心洞察，包括从“供给优先”到“需求优先”的战略演变，以及被称为“五足凳”的深度跨职能协作框架。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To change culture, establish a single North Star Metric (GMS) and repeat the narrative 6x more than you think is necessary.",
    "In a marketplace, start by obsessing over Supply (sellers), but shift focus to Demand (buyers) to ensure sellers actually make money.",
    "Use platform data to guide sellers: Encourage specific actions (e.g., better photos, instant booking) that mathematically improve conversion.",
    "Expand the traditional Product triad into a 'Five-Legged Stool' by adding Research and Marketing as core decision-makers.",
    "Drive retention by closing 'habit loops': Use user intent (like favoriting an item) to trigger high-value notifications (item on sale).",
    "Hire for curiosity and decisiveness: Look for PMs who can make calls with imperfect data and teach themselves new skills."
