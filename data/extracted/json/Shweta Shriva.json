    "company": "Waymo",
    "background": "Shweta is currently leading product management at Waymo, focusing on autonomous driving behavior, simulation tools, and ride-hailing commercialization. Previously, she was CPO at Nauto and held leadership roles at AWS and Cisco.",
    "background_zh": "Shweta 目前担任 Waymo 的高级产品总监，负责自动驾驶行为、仿真工具及网约车商业化落地。在此之前，她曾任 Nauto 的首席产品官（CPO），并在 AWS 和 Cisco 担任过领导职务。"

  "episodeSummary": "Shweta discusses the unique challenges of product management for autonomous vehicles, contrasting 'move fast and break things' with safety-critical systems. She details how Waymo builds trust through 'natural' driving behaviors and shares leadership lessons on communication efficiency and career growth from her time at Amazon and Waymo.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Shweta 探讨了自动驾驶领域产品管理的独特挑战，对比了传统的“快速迭代试错”模式与生命攸关的安全系统之间的差异。她详细介绍了 Waymo 如何通过“拟人化”的驾驶行为建立用户信任，并分享了她在 Amazon 和 Waymo 积累的高效沟通与职业成长方面的领导力经验。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "In safety-critical deep tech, the MVP bar is significantly higher; you cannot 'cut corners' on safety to iterate faster.",
    "Building trust in AI requires designing 'body language' and predictability into the system, not just following traffic rules.",
    "Autonomous vehicles must learn 'social norms' (unspoken rules) of driving, not just legal regulations, to feel natural.",
    "Use the 'Rule of Seven' to stop endless email threads and force synchronous resolution.",
    "To get promoted, focus obsessively on business impact rather than maneuvering for the title.",
    "Large companies must disrupt themselves before startups do (The Innovator's Dilemma)."
