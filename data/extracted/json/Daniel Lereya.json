    "company": "Monday.com",
    "background": "Daniel joined Monday.com when it had roughly 40 employees and $4M ARR, guiding the product and technology organization through hyper-growth to over 2,500 employees and $1B+ in ARR. He has overseen the transition from a single product to a multi-product platform.",
    "background_zh": "Daniel 加入 Monday.com 时，公司仅有约 40 名员工，ARR 为 400 万美元。他带领产研团队经历了爆发式增长，将团队规模扩充至 2,500 人以上，ARR 突破 10 亿美元。在此期间，他主导了公司从单一产品向多产品平台的战略转型。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Daniel Lereya shares the internal transformations Monday.com underwent to scale from a small startup to a multi-product public company. The conversation centers on a pivotal moment where competitor speed forced them to reinvent their engineering culture, the implementation of 'radical transparency' to turn employees into partners, and the necessity of shifting from feature-output to impact-outcomes. He also discusses the counterintuitive risks of not taking bold leaps and how to operationalize ambition.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat competitor speed as a 'gift' that proves what is possible, rather than a demoralizing factor.",
    "Set 'impossible goals' (e.g., 25 features in one month) not to burn people out, but to force a complete rethink of the 'how' behind execution.",
    "Radical transparency—sharing churn, revenue, and failures—creates deep partnership; shielding employees from bad news alienates them.",
    "Infrastructure challenges shouldn't just be patched; they should be reimagined as strategic competitive advantages (e.g., MondayDB).",
    "Use 'Time Traps' to force focus: set a strict deadline and cut scope to meet it, rather than extending timelines to perfect the scope.",
    "As a leader, the skills that got you to your current level (e.g., knowing every detail) become liabilities at the next level; you must let go of former superpowers.",
    "Don't build features to 'enhance' or 'augment'; build them to move specific numbers, and obsess over those numbers daily."
