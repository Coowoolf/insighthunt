He breaks down his 'Impact Career Equation' for evaluating roles, the 'Understand Work' operating model for de-risking product bets, and the 'Adjacent User Theory' for driving sustained growth. He also discusses the '5-Box Change Diagnostic' for managing team culture and the importance of leadership as a coaching practice.",
