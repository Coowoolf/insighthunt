  "episodeSummary": "This episode explores the emerging function of Product Operations (Product Ops) and why it is essential for scaling technology companies. Melissa and Denise breakdown the 'Three Pillars' of Product Ops, explain how it liberates Product Managers to focus on strategy rather than administrative tasks, and provide a roadmap for implementing this function without creating bureaucracy.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "本期节目探讨了新兴的“产品运营”（Product Ops）职能及其对扩展期科技公司的重要性。Melissa 和 Denise 拆解了产品运营的“三大支柱”，解释了该职能如何通过承担行政琐事来解放产品经理，使其专注于战略工作，并提供了在避免官僚主义的前提下落地该职能的路线图。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Product Ops does not take away decision-making rights; it informs better decisions by removing friction.",
    "If PMs are spending 30% of time on strategy and 70% on 'shadow work' (like SQL queries or scheduling), you need Product Ops.",
    "Start small: Don't hire a massive team. Start with one person solving the biggest pain point among the three pillars.",
    "Executive visibility is a key driver for Product Ops; standardize roadmaps so leadership isn't digging through Jira.",
    "Don't just hire Agile Coaches for this role; you need people who understand the product context and business strategy.",
    "Product Ops manages the system/process, but PMs still own the user research synthesis and strategic trade-offs."
