  "episodeSummary": "Madhavan Ramanujam dismantles the traditional 'build first, price later' approach, arguing that 72% of innovations fail due to a lack of monetization strategy. He outlines a comprehensive framework for determining willingness to pay before product development begins. The conversation covers advanced segmentation, packaging strategies like 'Leaders, Fillers, and Killers,' and behavioral pricing tactics.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Madhavan Ramanujam 拆解了传统的“先开发后定价”模式，指出72%的创新失败归因于缺乏商业化策略。他提出了一个在产品开发前确定支付意愿（WTP）的完整框架。对话涵盖了高级细分策略、“领头羊、填充物与杀手”的打包策略，以及行为经济学定价战术。",
