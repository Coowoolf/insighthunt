    "title": "Co-founder, Y Combinator & Author, Founders at Work",
    "company": "Y Combinator",
    "background": "Jessica Livingston is the co-founder of Y Combinator, the world's most successful startup accelerator. Known as the 'Social Radar,' she played a pivotal role in shaping YC's culture and selecting founders for unicorns like Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox based on character and interpersonal dynamics rather than just technical specs.",
    "background_zh": "Jessica Livingston 是全球最成功的创业加速器 Y Combinator 的联合创始人。作为 YC 的“社交雷达”，她在塑造 YC 文化以及挑选 Airbnb、Stripe 和 Dropbox 等独角兽企业的创始人方面发挥了关键作用，她更看重创业者的性格特征和人际互动，而非仅仅关注技术指标。"
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Jessica Livingston discusses her unique superpower dubbed 'The Social Radar,' which allowed her to identify successful founders in the earliest stages based on subtle behavioral cues. She breaks down the non-technical red flags that kill startups, the importance of founder earnestness, and shares behind-the-scenes stories of YC's most famous investments like Airbnb.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jessica Livingston 深入探讨了她被称为“社交雷达”的独特超能力，即通过微妙的行为线索在极早期识别成功创业者。她详细拆解了导致创业失败的非技术性危险信号（Red Flags）、创始人“真诚度”的重要性，并分享了 Airbnb 等 YC 明星项目背后的投资趣闻。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Technical skills matter, but co-founder dynamics are the single biggest predictor of early-stage survival.",
    "Defensiveness in an interview is a major red flag; adaptability and openness to feedback are critical for pivoting.",
    "Successful founders are 'relentlessly resourceful'—they must demonstrate the ability to make things happen (hustle) even with zero budget.",
    "Earnestness is a key differentiator; avoid founders who are building something just because it seems like a 'cool' trend.",
    "Founders must be willing to 'burn the boats' and quit their day jobs; part-time founders rarely succeed when things get tough."
