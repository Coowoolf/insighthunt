  "episodeSummary": "Elena Verna dismantles common growth myths by listing 10 tactics that consistently fail, ranging from premature hiring to futile redesigns. She shifts the conversation from \"growth hacking\" to sustainable growth strategy, emphasizing the importance of founder-led growth in early stages, the necessity of owned channels over rented algorithms, and the critical need to layer new growth loops every 18 months.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Do not hire a Head of Growth until you have strong product-market fit, data volume, and at least $1M-$5M ARR; early growth must be founder-led.",
    "A declining business cannot be fixed by a growth team; growth amplifies existing success but cannot fix core product or retention issues.",
    "Website redesigns and rebrands almost always result in an initial performance drop and rarely drive immediate acquisition improvements.",
    "Stop obsession over A/B testing low-volume pages; if you can't reach significance in one month, use a 'Pre vs. Post' analysis instead.",
    "Diversify away from 'rented' channels (SEO, Ads) where algorithms control your fate, and prioritize 'earned' channels (UGC, Viral Loops, Community).",
    "Dedicate 20-25% of the growth team's annual capacity to discovering the next growth horizon, as every loop eventually decays.",
    "Do not try to solve growth problems from scratch; assume your problem isn't unique and pattern-match against other companies or hire advisors for specific workshops."

        "Step 1: Verify PMF (Product Market Fit) via strong retention rates and a high 'Sean Ellis' disappointment score.",
        "Step 2: Ensure data maturity; you cannot have a growth team without sufficient data volume for analysis.",
        "Step 3: Confirm you are not hiring to 'fix' a decline; growth teams are for acceleration, not saving a sinking ship.",
