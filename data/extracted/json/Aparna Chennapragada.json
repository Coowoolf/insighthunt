    "background": "A veteran product leader who previously served as CPO at Robinhood and VP at Google (leading Google Lens, AR, and Assistant). She currently oversees AI product strategy for Microsoft 365 and their work on agents, blending deep technical expertise in computer vision/AI with consumer and enterprise product strategy."

  "episodeSummary": "Aparna Chennapragada dismantles the notion that AI makes product management obsolete, arguing instead that \"NLX is the new UX\" and that PMs must evolve into taste-makers and editors. She outlines specific frameworks for designing natural language interfaces, managing the \"chaos\" of zero-to-one innovation, and operationalizing a team that \"lives one year in the future.\" The conversation bridges the gap between high-level AI strategy and the tactical execution of building agents, prototyping with prompt sets, and evaluating market timing.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat prompt sets as the new PRDs; if you aren't prototyping to see what you want to build, you are moving too slow.",
    "Adopt the 'NLX' mindset: Conversation has grammar and UI elements (plans, showing work, follow-ups) that must be explicitly designed, not left to the model.",
    "For zero-to-one products, avoid 'Big Kid Metrics' like retention or CTR initially; focus purely on the qualitative success of the core utility (e.g., 'did the timer set?').",
    "Evaluate new product opportunities by looking for at least 2 of 3 inflection points: a tech step-function, a consumer behavior shift, or a business model shift.",
    "Operationalize 'living in the future' by forcing teams to use alpha-stage AI tools for daily work to develop instincts for where the market will be in 12 months.",
    "Update your priors constantly; AI capabilities evolve so fast (the baby becomes a teenager in a month) that relying on last quarter's constraints will kill your innovation.",
    "The PM role is shifting from 'gatherer of requirements' to 'editor and taste-maker'—the supply of ideas and prototypes will skyrocket, making curation the scarce resource."

        "Prompts as UI: Treat the initial prompt and suggested prompts as distinct navigation elements, like a menu.",
        "The 'Plan' Object: When a user gives a complex goal, the agent should return an editable 'plan' before execution, acting as a confirmation dialog.",
        "Show Your Work (Variable Visibility): Expose the agent's 'thinking' process to build trust, but tune the verbosity based on latency and user expertise.",
