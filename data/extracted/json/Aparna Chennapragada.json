  "episodeSummary": "Aparna Chennapragada, CPO at Microsoft, discusses the shift in product development driven by AI. She explores the transition from graphical interfaces to natural language experiences (NLX), the necessity of prototyping as a primary specification tool, and frameworks for evaluating the timing and viability of zero-to-one products. The conversation covers the balance between innovation and governance in enterprise AI, the evolving role of product managers, and the concept of collaborative intelligence between humans and agents.",

      "summary": "A framework defining the new principles and UI constructs required for Natural Language Interfaces, moving beyond simple chat to structured, designed conversations.",
      "principles": [
        "Prompt as UI: The prompt is a distinct UI element, similar to a dropdown or menu.",
        "Editable Plans: Agents should return structured, editable plans for complex goals, not just text.",
        "Show the Work: Visualize the agent's reasoning process (thinking aloud) to build trust, balancing verbosity with utility.",
        "Designed Follow-ups: Proactively suggest next steps to guide the user down a 'happy path'."

      "problemItSolves": "Prevents 'Frankenstein products' where AI is just a raw model attached to an app without design structure, ensuring usability and trust.",
      "whenToUse": "When designing AI agents, chatbots, or conversational interfaces to ensure they are intuitive and effective.",
      "commonMistakes": "Assuming 'the model is the product' and neglecting design; making the AI a black box without feedback; failing to guide the user after an output.",
      "quote": "NLX is the new UX... Conversations also have grammars. They have structures. They have UI elements. They're invisible.",
      "realWorldExample": "Designing a research agent that doesn't just answer but proposes a plan for how it will gather information, or an image generator suggesting logical stylistic follow-ups.",
