  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To be seen as strategic, you must both articulate a compelling 'why' and act as a change agent for hard, long-term decisions.",
    "Reframe difficult management challenges (like layoffs or conflict) as 'fun' learning opportunities to shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset.",
    "Summarization is a tactical superpower; summarizing meeting discussions makes people feel heard and positions you as a strategic thinker.",
    "Adopt the role of a 'historian' when joining a company: study past decisions and failures to understand organizational context and baggage.",
    "Make decisions with 70% of the information; committing to a decision generates higher fidelity data than staying in analysis paralysis.",
    "When dealing with difficult personalities, replace frustration with gratitude by asking what specific skill or trait you can learn from them.",
    "Breaking into product management is most effective via internal transfers from product-adjacent roles (support, sales, engineering) rather than applying externally without experience.",
    "To succeed in 'Founder Mode' as a product leader, you must deeply understand the business details to earn the right to make significant course corrections."
