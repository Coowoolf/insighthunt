  "episodeSummary": "Benjamin Mann discusses the trajectory of AI development, predicting a 50% chance of superintelligence by 2028. He details Anthropic's departure from OpenAI due to safety concerns, the mechanics of Constitutional AI (RLAIF), and how to build products for exponential technologies. He also introduces the 'Economic Turing Test' as a metric for AGI and offers advice on future-proofing careers.",
