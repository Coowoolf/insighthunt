  "episodeSummary": "Benjamin Mann discusses the trajectory of AI development, predicting a 50% chance of superintelligence by 2028. He details Anthropic's departure from OpenAI due to safety concerns, the mechanics of Constitutional AI (RLAIF), and how to build products for exponential technologies. He also introduces the 'Economic Turing Test' as a metric for AGI and offers advice on future-proofing careers.",

      "name": "The Exponential Puck Framework",
      "category": "Product Strategy",
      "summary": "A strategic approach to product development in rapidly accelerating fields. Instead of building for current model capabilities, teams should analyze exponential scaling laws to predict future capabilities (6-12 months out) and build products that rely on those future states, even if current success rates are low.",
      "principles": [
        "Internalize the exponential curve; progress looks flat until the knee of the curve.",
        "Don't build for today's model limitations.",
        "Identify capabilities working 20% of the time today; assume they will work 100% of the time soon.",
        "Design the product experience for the future capability state."
      ],
      "problemItSolves": "Prevents teams from building products that are obsolete by launch time or failing to leverage upcoming intelligence leaps.",
      "whenToUse": "When developing software on top of rapidly improving foundational technologies (like LLMs) where capabilities double frequently.",
      "commonMistakes": "treating new tools like old tools (e.g., just using autocomplete vs. ambitious coding agents); giving up when a prompt fails once.",
      "quote": "Don't build for today, build for six months from now... things that aren't quite working that are working 20% of the time, will start working 100% of the time.",
      "realWorldExample": "Anthropic's 'Claude Code' was built assuming users would move away from IDEs to terminals, even before the model was fully perfect at it.",

      "category": "AI Safety & Engineering",
      "summary": "A methodology for aligning AI behavior using RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) rather than human feedback. It involves baking a 'constitution' of values (e.g., UN Declaration of Human Rights) into the model, allowing it to critique and rewrite its own responses to ensure safety and character consistency.",

      "whenToUse": "When training large-scale models where human labeling is too slow or inconsistent, or when defining specific agent personas/values.",
      "commonMistakes": "Relying solely on user engagement metrics (sycophancy) rather than principled alignment.",
      "quote": "If the answer is no, actually I wasn't in compliance with the principle, then we ask the model itself to critique itself and rewrite its own response.",
