    "title": "Corporate Vice President of Product, AI Platform",
    "company": "Microsoft",
    "background": "Currently overseeing Microsoft's AI infrastructure and agent toolchains. Formerly COO at Instacart and VP of Product at Meta (Messenger, Instagram Direct). She serves on the boards of The Home Depot and Coupang."
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Asha Sharma discusses the seismic shift from static software to \"product as organism\" and the impending agentic society. She details how Microsoft adapts its product planning to the rapid pace of AI innovation using a \"Seasons\" framework and explains why the future of product differentiation lies in post-training loops and reinforcement learning rather than pre-training base models.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Move from 'Product as Artifact' to 'Product as Organism': KPIs should measure the metabolism of your product's ability to ingest data and improve via reward models, not just feature shipping velocity.",
    "Implement 'Seasonal Planning' instead of rigid roadmaps: Align teams around a thematic 'Season' (e.g., Season of Agents) driven by secular trends, with loose quarterly OKRs and 4-6 week execution sprints.",
    "Prioritize 'Invisible Work' in platform building: Like WhatsApp winning on reliability/privacy rather than stickers, AI platforms win on data residency, latency, and reliability, not just surface features.",
    "The 'Polymath' Product Builder: The lines between PM, engineering, and design are dissolving. The most valuable builders now manage the full loop—from system design to UI to fine-tuning.",
    "Post-Training is the new Pre-Training: Economic leverage now comes from fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL) on domain-specific data, rather than building massive base models.",
    "Prepare for the 'Work Chart': As agents proliferate, organizational hierarchy (the Org Chart) will be replaced by task-based flows (the Work Chart), reducing the need for middle-management layers.",
    "Design for Composability over GUIs: Future interfaces will likely be code-native or text-stream based to interact better with LLMs, moving away from complex graphical user interfaces."

      "problemItSolves": "Traditional 6-12 month roadmaps become obsolete instantly due to the rapid pace of AI model releases (e.g., a sudden GPT-5 launch).",
      "summary": "A dynamic planning framework that aligns teams around a current technological theme ('The Season') while maintaining flexibility for rapid industry shifts, ensuring the organization isn't locked into outdated strategies.",
      "principles": [
        "Identify the Season: Define the current 'Season' based on secular industry changes (e.g., 'The Season of Prototyping' or 'The Season of Agents').",
        "Set Loose Quarterly OKRs: Establish high-level objectives that put the team on the path to the Season's North Star, but avoid over-specifying solutions.",
        "Execute in 4-6 Week Squad Goals: Teams operate in small squads targeting specific problem areas with short time horizons.",
        "Leave Slack for the Slope: Intentionally leave capacity unplanned to accommodate 'unplanned' disruptions or new model capabilities (building for the slope, not the snapshot)."
      ],
      "whenToUse": "In hyper-growth or rapidly changing technology sectors (specifically AI) where underlying infrastructure changes faster than product cycles.",
      "commonMistakes": "Locking in a 'Season' for too long (e.g., a year) without re-evaluating external tech shifts, or failing to communicate the 'North Star' metric that defines the season's success.",
      "quote": "We think about it as what season are we in? Season one might've been prototyping of AI... and now it's the advent of agents.",
      "realWorldExample": "Microsoft's AI team shifted from a 'Season of Reasoning Models' to a 'Season of Agents,' adjusting their entire roadmap to focus on tool-calling and agentic behaviors rather than just model performance."

      "summary": "A framework for treating products as living systems that ingest data and 'metabolize' it into better outcomes through continuous fine-tuning and reward modeling.",
      "principles": [
        "Define the Reward Model: Clearly identify what outcome the model should optimize for (e.g., acceptance rate, speed, price).",
        "Establish the Data Loop: Create mechanisms to capture high-quality feedback (implicit or explicit) from usage.",
        "Integrate Expert Annotation: Don't rely solely on synthetic data; inject human expert labeling to guide the model (The 'Human-in-the-Loop' necessity).",
        "Measure Product Metabolism: Track how quickly the system can ingest new data, re-train/fine-tune, and deploy the improved version to users."
      ],
      "whenToUse": "When building AI-native applications where the core value proposition is dependent on the model getting smarter over time (e.g., coding assistants, medical scribes).",
      "commonMistakes": "Treating the AI model as a static API call rather than a component that needs constant 'feeding' and tuning based on user interaction.",
      "quote": "All of a sudden, the whole KPI is what is the metabolism of a product team to be able to ingest data and then digest the rewards model and then create some sort of outcome?",
      "realWorldExample": "Microsoft's 'Dragon' product for physicians improved acceptance rates from 30-60% to 83% by annotating 600,000 patient-physician interactions and feeding that expert data back into the model loop."

      "realWorldExample": "Porch Group succeeded not by building flashy home design tools initially, but by creating a matching platform that mapped 6 million professionals to 37,000 zip codes—optimizing the 'invisible work' of lead matching."
