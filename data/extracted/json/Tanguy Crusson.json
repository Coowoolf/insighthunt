    "company": "Atlassian",
    "background": "A veteran product leader with over 10 years at Atlassian, Tanguy has worked on major initiatives including HipChat, Stride, and Statuspage. He most recently led Jira Product Discovery from a zero-to-one internal idea to one of Atlassian's fastest-growing products.",
    "background_zh": "Atlassian拥有超过10年经验的资深产品领袖，曾负责HipChat、Stride和Statuspage等核心项目。最近，他带领Jira Product Discovery从内部孵化的0到1创意，发展成为Atlassian历史上增长最快的产品之一。"

  "episodeSummary": "Tanguy Crusson shares the brutal realities and strategic frameworks for building zero-to-one products inside a massive enterprise like Atlassian. He dissects the failures of HipChat (competing with Slack) and the success of Jira Product Discovery, offering a blueprint for internal incubation, protecting early ideas from corporate bureaucracy, and validating product-market fit.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Tanguy Crusson分享了在Atlassian这样的大型企业内部进行0到1产品创新的残酷现实与战略框架。他深度剖析了HipChat（与Slack竞争）的失败教训以及Jira Product Discovery的成功经验，为内部孵化、保护早期创意免受大公司官僚主义影响以及验证PMF（产品市场匹配）提供了实战蓝图。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Position internal bets as 'likely to fail' to secure autonomy and prevent the wider organization from over-investing or meddling too early.",
    "Avoid 'Competitive Myopia'; focusing too much on competitors (like HipChat vs. Slack) leads to feature parity chasing rather than solving unique user problems.",
    "Do not rewrite a product while trying to compete with a fast-moving startup; you cannot fix the plane while flying it against a faster opponent.",
    "Use internal communications (demos, customer snippets) to create 'High-Speed Train' momentum that stakeholders are afraid to block.",
    "Create scarcity deliberately; large companies tend to over-resourcing, but innovation requires the 'starvation' mindset of a startup.",
    "The 'Why Now' is as important as the idea itself; good ideas get shelved if you cannot articulate the urgency of the market timing."
