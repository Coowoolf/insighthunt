He discusses the importance of utility curves, why \"work-like activities\" kill productivity, and how to apply empathy and taste to build software that doesn't make users feel stupid.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Stewart Butterfield 分享了深刻的产品智慧，挑战了关于阻力（Friction）和效率的传统观念。他探讨了效用曲线的重要性，解释了为什么“类工作活动”会扼杀生产力，以及如何运用同理心和品味来构建真正以用户为中心的软件，避免让用户感到愚蠢。",
