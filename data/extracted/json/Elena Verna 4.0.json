    "background_zh": "Elena 是一位享誉业界的增长专家，曾主导 Miro、Dropbox、SurveyMonkey、Amplitude 和 Netlify 的增长业务。作为 Lovable 现任增长负责人，她助力公司在全员不足 100 人的规模下，仅耗时不到一年便实现了 2 亿美元 ARR。"

  "episodeSummary": "Elena Verna discusses the unprecedented growth of Lovable (0 to $200M ARR in <1 year) and how the traditional growth playbook has been upended by the AI revolution. She details why optimization is dead, why 'Minimum Lovable Product' has replaced MVP, and how AI companies must recapture product-market fit every three months due to rapidly evolving technology and consumer expectations.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Viability is obsolete; shift from Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) where emotional connection and delight are table stakes.",
    "Throw out the 80/20 optimization rule; in fast-moving AI markets, spend 95% of time innovating on new features and only 5% optimizing existing funnels.",
    "Treat high variable costs (like LLM tokens) as Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) rather than COGS; aggressively give the product away to fuel word-of-mouth.",
    "Product-Market Fit is no longer a destination but a treadmill; expect to lose and need to recapture PMF every 3 months as model capabilities and user expectations shift.",
    "Move activation ownership from the Growth team to the Core Product team; in AI, the 'agent' determines activation quality, not the onboarding UI.",
    "Marketing is now synonymous with shipping velocity; ship daily to maintain 'noise' in the market and use feature releases as the primary retention and resurrection mechanism.",
    "Hire for 'vibe coding' skills—the ability to use AI to rapidly prototype and build fully functional internal tools or marketing assets without traditional engineering resources."

      "summary": "A strategic stance accepting that Product-Market Fit is perishable. Instead of scaling a static PMF for years, teams must pivot and reinvent their core value proposition quarterly to match step-function changes in LLM capabilities.",
      "principles": [
        "Monitor the underlying tech cycle: LLM capabilities jump roughly every 3 months; your product roadmap must anticipate these jumps rather than react to them.",
        "Recalibrate for the 'Pioneer' users constantly: In the early AI wave, you cannot afford to settle for the 'Latent Majority' yet; you must satisfy the power users to stay relevant.",
        "Accept high churn as natural: If the market moves fast, users will churn; focus on recapturing them with new capabilities rather than traditional retention tactics.",
