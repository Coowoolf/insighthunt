  "episodeSummary": "Itamar Gilad challenges the traditional \"opinion-based\" product development model, advocating for an \"evidence-guided\" approach. Drawing from his experiences with the failure of Google+ and the success of Gmail's tabbed inbox, he introduces practical frameworks like GIST, the Confidence Meter, and Metrics Trees to help teams validate ideas cheaply and align on outcomes.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Itamar Gilad 对传统的“基于观点（Opinion-based）”的产品开发模式提出挑战，倡导“证据驱动（Evidence-guided）”的方法。结合 Google+ 的失败教训和 Gmail 分类收件箱的成功经验，他介绍了 GIST、置信度仪表盘（Confidence Meter）和指标树（Metrics Trees）等实用框架，帮助团队以低成本验证创意并以此达成结果对齐。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Replace opinion-based roadmaps with evidence-guided validation loops.",
