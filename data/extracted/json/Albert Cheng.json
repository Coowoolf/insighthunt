  "episodeSummary": "Albert Cheng discusses his growth philosophies honed at three major consumer subscription companies. He covers the Explore and Exploit framework for managing experimentation, the Gamification Triad for retention, and his unique approach to hiring high-agency talent. The conversation delves into practical tactics for monetization, the integration of AI in growth workflows, and the cultural shift required to scale experimentation from zero to 1,000 tests per year.",

      "whenToUse": "When managing a portfolio of growth experiments or when a product area faces diminishing returns.",
      "commonMistakes": "Staying in exploit mode too long leading to saturation, or exploring without a strategy to scale wins.",
      "quote": "When done right, you can oscillate between the two until you saturate out of exploitation mode and then you encourage the teams to brainstorm and get more creative again.",
      "realWorldExample": "At Chess.com, they 'explored' why users reviewed games (finding they did it after wins, not losses) and 'exploited' this by redesigning the flow to celebrate wins, increasing engagement by 25%.",
