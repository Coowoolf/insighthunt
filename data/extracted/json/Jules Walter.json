  "episodeSummary": "Jules Walter discusses the evolution of Product Management skills, distinguishing between 'IQ skills' (execution, product sense) needed for early career and 'EQ skills' (communication, leadership) required for seniority. He provides a tactical masterclass on outcome-based learning, how to build mentorship relationships from scratch, and leveraging strengths to accelerate career growth.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Jules Walter 探讨了产品经理技能的演进，区分了职业生涯早期所需的“IQ类技能”（执行力、产品感）和晋升所需的“EQ类技能”（沟通、领导力）。他详细讲解了基于结果的学习法、如何从零构建导师关系网，以及如何利用个人优势加速职业发展。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Early career PM success relies on IQ skills (execution, product sense), while leadership requires EQ skills (communication, influence).",
    "To learn a new domain, define a specific business outcome first, then work backward to identify the necessary questions and mentors.",
    "When seeking mentorship, start with a 'low friction' specific question via email rather than asking for a generic coffee chat.",
    "The key to maintaining mentors is 'closing the loop': always report back on how you applied their advice and the results achieved.",
    "Identify your superpowers by asking: 'What do people compliment me on that I feel is easy or obvious?'",
    "Every strength has a 'shadow side'—a context where it becomes a weakness (e.g., curiosity can look like lack of knowledge without context)."
