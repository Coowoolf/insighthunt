    "background": "Former Director of Product at Slack, GM at Zynga, and VP of Product at Runkeeper. He began his career at Pixar working on simulation and rigging for films like Finding Nemo and Up, giving him a unique background in blending technical execution with creative storytelling.",
    "background_zh": "前 Slack 产品总监、Zynga 总经理及 Runkeeper 产品副总裁。职业生涯始于皮克斯，曾负责《海底总动员》和《飞屋环游记》等电影的仿真与骨骼绑定工作。这段经历赋予了他将技术落地与创意叙事完美融合的独特背景。"

  "episodeSummary": "Fareed Mosavat deconstructs the non-linear career path of a Product Manager, focusing specifically on the difficult transition from Individual Contributor (IC) to Product Leader. He argues that PMs cannot learn through theory alone but require a specific 'Learning Loop' of execution and generalization. The conversation details how to cross the 'Product Leader Canyon,' avoid the 'Manager Death Spiral,' and categorize product work to build a balanced strategic portfolio.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "To accelerate your career, move from 'Execution' to 'Generalization'—don't just ship a feature; abstract the principle behind why it worked to apply it elsewhere.",
    "Practice 'Strategic Curiosity' by understanding the business two levels up (strategy/board), two levels down (technical/data), and across functions (sales/marketing).",
    "Seek sponsorship over mentorship; sponsorship creates opportunities and is earned by solving the organization's most critical problems.",
    "Avoid the 'Manager Death Spiral' by shifting your mindset from 'doing the work' to 'editing the work' and trusting your team with high-leverage problems.",
    "Stop acting like a victim of resource constraints; explicitly map the required resources to the desired business outcome and ask for them.",
    "Audit your roadmap against the 'Four Types of Product Work' to ensure you aren't over-indexing on your personal strengths (e.g., a Growth PM ignoring technical scaling)."

      "problemItSolves": "PMs often plateau because they treat every project as an isolated task rather than a career-building step.",
      "summary": "A cyclical process for accelerating product mastery. It moves beyond simple execution to ensuring that every project builds intellectual capital and organizational trust, allowing the PM to tackle increasingly ambiguous problems.",
      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Execute - Work on real products with real data (no fake homework).",
        "Step 2: Generalize - Abstract the specific win into a broader mental model (e.g., 'High friction onboarding works for high-intent products').",
        "Step 3: Communicate - explicitly share both the work and the generalized learning to the org.",
        "Step 4: Scale - Leverage the trust gained from communication to acquire larger, more ambiguous problem sets."
