  "episodeSummary": "Richard Rumelt deconstructs the misconceptions surrounding corporate strategy, arguing that true strategy is problem-solving rather than goal-setting. He introduces his 'Kernel' framework and the concept of 'The Crux' to help leaders cut through 'fluff' and focus on actionable solutions to their most critical, solvable challenges.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Richard Rumelt 深度拆解了围绕企业战略的常见误区，主张真正的战略本质是解决问题，而非单纯设定目标。他介绍了“战略核心（The Kernel）”框架和“关键症结（The Crux）”概念，帮助领导者剔除“虚词空话”，聚焦于那些最关键且可解决的挑战，并制定可落地的行动方案。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Strategy is not a list of ambitions or goals; it is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge.",
    "Stop calling it 'strategy' and call it an 'Action Agenda' to force concrete steps.",
    "The 'Kernel' of good strategy consists of a Diagnosis, a Guiding Policy, and Coherent Actions.",
    "Bad strategy often stems from a refusal to choose—having 17 priorities means you have none.",
    "The 'Crux' is the intersection of what is critically important and what is actually addressable right now.",
    "Power in strategy comes from leverage and asymmetry—applying focused strength against a weakness.",
    "For startups, strategy is a bet; you must commit to a hypothesis but remain agile enough to pivot when reality reveals itself."
