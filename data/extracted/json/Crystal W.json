  "episodeSummary": "Crystal Widjaja shares her playbook for scaling Southeast Asia's biggest startups, focusing on the transition from intuition to rigorous data science. She details how to execute 'Wizard of Oz' experiments to validate features without code, establishes concrete benchmarks for retention, and explains why most analytics implementations fail to generate actual insights.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Run experiments even with small sample sizes (N=30); the precision changes, but the directional trend rarely does.",
    "For free consumer products, aim for 60% Week 1 retention that flattens immediately; if early adopters drop off, mass market users definitely will.",
    "Stop treating 'retention' as a goal; it is a result. Focus on the 'setup moment'—the step immediately preceding the conversion event.",
    "Most analytics fail because they track observations (events), not context. You must track the state of the world (properties) at the time of the event to derive insight.",
    "Utilize 'Physics vs. Levers' thinking: Understand the immutable constraints of your market (Physics) before trying to optimize your growth loops (Levers).",
    "When hiring growth roles, prioritize statistical intuition and 'first principles' thinking over tool proficiency.",
    "Use 'Wizard of Oz' testing (e.g., manual WhatsApp groups, static screenshots) to validate complex features like subscriptions before engineering builds them."

        "第三步：基于场景上下文进行细分。在分析转化率时，不要局限于用户类型，而要基于用户所处的具体场景进行拆解（例如：“当界面仅显示 2 位司机时，用户转化率下降了 50%”）。"
