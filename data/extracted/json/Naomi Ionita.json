  "episodeSummary": "Naomi Ionita joins Lenny to dismantle common misconceptions about monetization, arguing that startups often wait too long to charge and fail to iterate on pricing. She introduces the 'Day 1 vs. Day 100' framework for feature packaging and discusses the 'Modern Growth Stack'—a suite of tools enabling growth teams to drive revenue without heavy engineering dependencies. The conversation covers practical survey methods for pricing and lessons from Evernote's missed opportunities.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Naomi Ionita 在本期节目中拆解了关于商业化的常见误区，指出初创公司往往太晚开始收费且缺乏对定价策略的迭代。她提出了用于功能权益打包的“第一天 vs. 第百天”框架，并介绍了“现代增长技术栈”——一套能让增长团队在不依赖繁重工程资源的情况下推动营收的工具体系。对话涵盖了实用的定价调研方法以及 Evernote 错失良机的经验教训。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Treat pricing like a product roadmap: revisit and iterate every 6-12 months.",
    "Monetization is a stronger growth lever than acquisition; a 1% improvement in monetization yields 4x the impact to the bottom line compared to acquisition.",
    "Don't rely on 'guilt' for conversion; if users pay because they feel bad using it for free, your free tier is too generous.",
    "Use the 'Day 1 vs. Day 100' framework to decide what goes into Freemium vs. Paid plans.",
    "Establish a cross-functional pricing committee (Product, Sales, Finance) rather than letting it sit in one silo.",
    "In enterprise sales negotiations, keep doubling or 10x-ing the price until you hit resistance to find the true willingness to pay.",
    "The Modern Growth Stack leverages reverse ETL and specialized tools to decouple business logic from engineering bottlenecks."
