    "PMs should start as engineers, designers, or salespeople to understand the 'potential energy' of a team before managing it.",

    "Use 'Decision Logs' to build product sense by documenting rationale and reviewing outcomes later.",
    "Send an 'Unsell Email' at the offer stage to be radically transparent about the job's downsides.",
    "Automate user research by triggering workflows from sales call transcripts (Gong) to schedule interviews.",
    "PMs define the constraints (perimeter), allowing engineers and designers to be creative within the box."
