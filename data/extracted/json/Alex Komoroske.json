    "LLMs act as 'magical duct tape,' fundamentally changing the cost structure of software by making code generation cheap but reliability variable.",
    "In an era of AI-generated content, human 'taste' and a unique perspective become the primary differentiators.",
    "Large organizations often operate under 'Kayfabe'—a shared pretense that a strategy is working even when individuals know it isn't.",
    "Product leaders should shift from a 'Builder' mindset (high effort, linear output) to a 'Gardener' mindset (planting seeds, compounding growth).",
    "Organizations function like 'slime molds' where coordination costs increase with the square of the number of people; leaders must navigate this rather than fight it.",
    "Productivity requires creating space for deep reflection to turn raw notes into synthesized insights."

      "category": "product-strategy",
      "summary": "A strategic approach that prioritizes creating self-sustaining ecosystems and compounding loops over linear building and direct manipulation.",
      "principles": [
        "Plant 'acorns' (low-cost experiments) that have the potential to grow into 'oak trees'.",
        "Look for systems with network effects or accelerating rates of return.",
        "Dedicate 70% of effort to legible value to buy 'cover fire' for the 30% of experimental gardening.",
        "Don't try to predict the winner beforehand; farm for miracles."

      "quote": "What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over."

        "Acknowledge that optimism (Kayfabe) is necessary for organizational lubrication.",
        "Recognize that challenging the 'fake' reality can be dangerous to one's career.",
        "Introduce disconfirming evidence gently or through 'ugly baby' ideas that don't threaten the core narrative immediately.",

      "quote": "The core dynamic that makes organizations hard to navigate as they get larger... is this emergent force or coordination... finding this coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people."
