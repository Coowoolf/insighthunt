  "episodeSummary": "Alex Komoroske joins Lenny to discuss the shift from industrial 'builder' mindsets to complexity-aware 'gardening' mindsets. He explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) act as 'magical duct tape,' how to navigate 'Organizational Kayfabe' (the shared illusions within companies), and how to generate emergent strategy through 'Nerd Clubs.' The conversation focuses on adapting to uncertainty, leveraging bottom-up emergence, and maintaining agency in large systems.",
