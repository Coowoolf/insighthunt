  "episodeSummary": "Ben Williams discusses Snyk's evolution from a niche developer tool to an $8.6B security giant. He details the transition from pure product-led growth (PLG) to a hybrid model with product-led sales (PLS), emphasizing the importance of starting narrow and deep. The conversation covers structuring growth teams, creating effective loops, defining activation milestones, and frameworks for crafting vision and mission statements.",
