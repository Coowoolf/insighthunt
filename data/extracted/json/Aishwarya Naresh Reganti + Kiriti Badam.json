    "background": "Keith Coleman and Jay Baxter lead the Community Notes team at X (formerly Twitter). Keith, a former product leader, and Jay, a machine learning engineer, developed the open-source, crowd-sourced context system that uses bridging algorithms to combat misinformation."

  "episodeSummary": "Keith Coleman and Jay Baxter discuss the origins, principles, and engineering behind Community Notes. They reveal how a small, 'thermal' team used dynamic goal-setting and a unique bridging-based algorithm to build a decentralized fact-checking system that scales effectively where traditional methods failed. The conversation covers the transition from Birdwatch, the impact of open-sourcing the algorithm, and the operational philosophy of 'Continuous Calibration' that allows them to move rapidly.",

      "summary": "A dynamic operational model that rejects rigid long-term planning (like quarterly OKRs) in favor of high-frequency goal setting and execution. The team aligns daily via a simple shared document and recalibrates their roadmap as often as bi-weekly based on immediate data feedback.",

        "Dynamic Goal Setting: Set milestones based on current data, not calendar quarters.",
