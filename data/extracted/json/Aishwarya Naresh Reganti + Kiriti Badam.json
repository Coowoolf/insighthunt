  "episodeSummary": "Keith Coleman and Jay Baxter discuss the origins, principles, and engineering behind Community Notes. They reveal how a small, 'thermal' team used dynamic goal-setting and a unique bridging-based algorithm to build a decentralized fact-checking system that scales effectively where traditional methods failed. The conversation covers the transition from Birdwatch, the impact of open-sourcing the algorithm, and the operational philosophy of 'Continuous Calibration' that allows them to move rapidly.",
