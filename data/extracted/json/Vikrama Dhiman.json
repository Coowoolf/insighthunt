  "episodeSummary": "In this episode, Vikrama Dhiman breaks down his \"3 W's\" framework for product manager career growth, emphasizing the balance between execution (output) and influence (operating model). He discusses the specific skills required to transition into product management, how to audit one's own career stagnation, and the art of managing stakeholders without being difficult.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "本期节目中，Vikrama Dhiman 详细拆解了他为产品经理职业成长创立的“3 W”框架，强调了执行力（产出）与影响力（运作模式）之间的平衡。他探讨了转型做产品所需的具体技能、如何自查职业瓶颈，以及如何在不在此过程中成为“刺头”的前提下有效管理利益相关者。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Early career PMs should obsess over 'Output' (execution) rather than Strategy; earn the right to strategize by delivering reliably.",
    "The '3 W's' of career growth are: What you produce, What you bring to the table, and What's your operating model.",
    "Product artifacts (PRDs, memos) are your resume; their quality demonstrates your depth in data, design, and tech.",
    "Effective collaboration means raising difficult issues without being a difficult person to work with.",
    "When transitioning to PM, focus on mastering two out of three hard skills first: Data, Tech, or Design/Research.",
    "Career stagnation often comes from telling yourself limiting stories (e.g., 'I am high agency' as an excuse for being rude).",
    "Benchmark your skills against the best in the industry, not just the best in your current team, to maintain a high rate of learning."
