  "episodeSummary": "Sarah Tavel breaks down two definitive frameworks for building enduring companies: the Hierarchy of Engagement for consumer apps and the Hierarchy of Marketplaces. She challenges common industry fixations on vanity metrics like MAU and raw GMV, arguing instead for a focus on \"Core Actions\" and \"Happy GMV\" to ensure long-term retention and market dominance.",
  "episodeSummary_zh": "Sarah Tavel 深度解析了构建基业长青公司的两大核心框架：针对消费级应用的“参与度层级”和针对交易平台的“市场层级”。她挑战了行业内对 MAU（月活）和粗放 GMV（交易总额）等虚荣指标的盲目追求，主张通过聚焦“核心行为”和“快乐GMV（Happy GMV）”来实现长期留存和市场主导地位。",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Identify your product's 'Core Action'—the specific user behavior that correlates with retention, not just app opens.",
    "Great consumer products must get better the more you use them (accruing benefits) and harder to leave (mounting loss).",
    "For marketplaces, not all GMV is equal; focus on 'Happy GMV' where customer satisfaction ensures retention.",
    "Start by boiling a thimble, not the ocean: constrain your marketplace initially (geography or category) to achieve liquidity.",
    "Think of markets as currents (momentum/timing), not just bodies of water (size).",
    "Anonymity in social products often fails because it prevents the accumulation of social capital and mounting loss."
