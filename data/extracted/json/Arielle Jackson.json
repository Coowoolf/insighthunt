    "background": "Arielle spent nine years at Google helping grow Gmail, was one of the first marketers at Square launching the Square Stand, and has since advised over 100 early-stage companies including Patreon, Loom, and Sprig on brand and marketing strategy."
  },
  "episodeSummary": "Arielle Jackson deconstructs the often amorphous concept of \"brand\" into a rigorous, step-by-step engineering process. She covers how to scientifically name a product, how to define a brand's purpose and personality, and why positioning must precede product development. The conversation provides specific frameworks for translating high-level company goals into concrete messaging that passes the \"human test.\"",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Positioning must happen before writing code; it dictates the product roadmap and marketing strategy.",
    "A brand is not a logo or color palette; it is strictly defined as 'who people think you are'.",
    "When naming, use a 'code name' so ridiculous you would never launch with it, preventing premature attachment to a mediocre placeholder.",
    "Avoid 'empty vessel' names (like Yahoo or Eero) unless you have a massive budget to educate the market; suggestive names (like Seesaw) do the marketing work for you.",
    "Use the 'Bar Test' to validate copy: if you wouldn't say the sentence to a friend at a bar, it shouldn't be on your website.",
    "Start with a highly specific 'Model Persona' (e.g., a specific dad in St. Louis) to capture a broader target audience (e.g., tech-savvy dads).",
    "Brands need tension to be interesting; define personality attributes as 'We are X, but not Y' (e.g., Playful but not silly).",
    "For PR, stop doing straight funding announcements; use funding only as a hook to tell a larger story about product momentum or customer success."

      "principles": [
        "Step 1: Write a Naming Brief. Define what the name must communicate, what to avoid, and competitive landscape.",
        "Step 2: Conduct two specific brainstorms: one based on synonyms/antonyms of positioning words, and a second 'Thematic' brainstorm (e.g., if naming an AI farm tool, brainstorm 'History of Botany').",
        "Step 3: Filter the shortlist (10-25 names) through a Red/Yellow/Green analysis against 7 criteria: Trademark, Domain, Distinctiveness, Timelessness, Reflection of Messaging, Sound/Pronunciation, and Appearance.",
        "Step 4: Select 3-5 top contenders for legal review (never fall in love with just one)."

      "realWorldExample": "Naming the ed-tech company 'Seesaw' because it evokes the back-and-forth between teacher, parent, and student, and taps into childhood nostalgia."

        "Step 4: Execute the Bar Test. Imagine saying this statement to a friend at a bar. If it sounds robotic (e.g., 'We leverage AI to empower...'), rewrite it until it sounds like natural speech (e.g., 'It turns your iPad into a cash register')."
