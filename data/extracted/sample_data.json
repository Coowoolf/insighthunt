He details his 'Reference Customer' technique for guaranteeing product-market fit before launch and offers a masterclass on leadership coaching.

      "For B2B products, do not launch until you have 6-8 reference customers who love the same version of the product.",
      "For B2C products, aim for 15-25 reference customers who are willing to stake their reputation on your product.",
      "Build trust with executives by asking the most influential person in the company to 'teach you' or let you 'intern' for them.",
      "To get promoted, do the job before you have the title; practice leadership in low-risk environments like non-profits or side projects.",
