She introduces a structured narrative framework that guides customers through market context rather than feature lists, helping them navigate purchasing anxiety. The conversation covers how to define differentiated value, why FOMO backfires on indecisive buyers, and how product and sales teams must collaborate to arm the internal champion. April Dunford dismantles common misconceptions about product positioning, arguing that it is not merely marketing fluff but the foundational context that makes a product's value obvious to buyers. She outlines a rigorous, step-by-step methodology for defining positioning based on competitive alternatives rather than abstract benefits. The conversation covers how to align cross-functional teams, the difference between early-stage 'loose' positioning and growth-stage 'tight' positioning, and why traditional B2B personas often lead teams astray.",
