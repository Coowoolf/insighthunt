  "en": "Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):\nToday I am excited to bring you a very special episode, which was recorded live at Figma Config with Figma CEO and co-founder, Dylan Field, in front of a live audience at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. This is the first ever live recording of this podcast and it was so much fun. If you watch this on YouTube, you can see the epic stage that they built specifically for us to recreate my podcast studio. I could not be more thankful to the Config team for making this happen.\n\n(00:28):\nIn my conversation with Dylan, we dig into how he builds and refines his product taste and intuition, how intuition is a hypothesis generator, the future of product management. How Dylan attempts to operationalize keeping Figma simple and to continue simplifying the experience. A bunch of stories from the early days of Figma that I've never heard before. Also, he shares his favorite AI tool called websim, which is wild. And if you wait till the very end, you can see a very young child actor Dylan Field in a clip that I found online that was hilarious.\n\n(01:00):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Dylan Field.\n\n(01:12):\nDylan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.\n\nDylan Field (01:16):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18):\nHi all.\n\nDylan Field (01:22):\nIs this your first live podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24):\nThis is my first ever live podcast. Also, a big thank you to the Config team who set up this crazy studio. I had no idea this was going to happen. I feel like I'm in my studio here with a thousand people watching us. It's very impressive. I very much dig the background and also the mics that may or may not be wired.\n\nDylan Field (01:40):\nThat's right. Don't say that. Don't tell people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42):\nOh, sorry.\n\nDylan Field (01:44):\nThere's no wires coming out of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45):\nThere's no one behind the curtain either. Okay, so Dylan, I want to start by just checking in on how you're doing. So Config is about to wrap up. We've been at it for two days now. I know how much lift goes into doing these sorts of things. I imagine you've been thinking about this for a long time now. I'm just curious how you're doing, any surprises, any highlights, any low lights?\n\nDylan Field (02:06):\nThe highlight is the community and just the incredible, incredible people here at Config. Y'all are awesome. I don't know why I keep talking in the mic like this. It's instinctual. But seriously, it's just the most amazing community to be part of and I feel so lucky. And then in terms of how I'm doing at this exact moment, exhausted, but riding on caffeine and whatever this really cool probiotic drink is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:36):\nAny surprises from the past couple of days? Anything that's like, \"Oh wow, that went a lot better than I thought, maybe less well.\"\n\nDylan Field (02:44):\nDemo, definitely things I would've improved. But also Emil and Mihika were phenomenal, and it was just so awesome to see them do their demos and present materials. I was just really pleased with the conversation, I think, that's getting started at Config around AI. I was looking online on social media and I think people are already zeroing in the right conversation, which is, okay, in a world of more software being created by AI, what does that mean and the impact on craft and the impact on quality and the need to have more unique design and how design is a differentiator.\n\n(03:37):\nAnd I think some people are saying, \"I agree with that.\" Some people are saying, \"That I disagree with that\", and that's exactly the bounds of what the conversation I imagined would emerge from yesterday. It was funny, the make design feature, I think that I said on the keynote, I was like, \"This is going to give you the most obvious thing in the most obvious form possible.\" And then people online are like, \"It's just going to give you some obvious thing.\" I agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:10):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versal, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(05:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their Document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one Document SDK.\n\n(06:03):\nMost product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's Document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered Webform styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's Drag and Drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil.

You once said that the definition of design is art applied to problem solving. Can you just add a bit more to that? What do you mean by that? Because that's an amazing line.\n\nDylan Field (07:09):\nWell, I don't think it's my original line. I think someone else said it, but there's a lot of definitions of design out there too. There's also 'design is dialogue' or 'design is problem solving'. You just go straight there. I could go with 10 more. But I like art applied to problem solving because I think that design is often... There is some component of creativity to it and unique expression that you're trying to provide and create and put out into the world. But you are also trying to do it and match it to a user need, a problem that needs to be solved. And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul. And so the combination of those two things is to me really beautiful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (08:03):\nI'm going to pivot to a very hard hitting question. I hope your PR people don't kill me for asking this. Many people asked me to ask you this question. Very important. Please explain a Figma tradition called raccoon feet and muffin hands.\n\nDylan Field (08:21):\nI should probably just leave this interview now. So this is a conversation, I'm not sure exactly where it started, but it started in early Figma. And basically we had these lunch tables at Figma where we would just all gather and have very long, interesting meandering conversations before we got back to work. And one of the questions that, was a 'would you rather', was would you rather have raccoons for feet or muffins for hands? And I think this is a deeply philosophical question. I have pondered it since I've heard it. I still don't have one answer. If you've got an answer, I'm curious what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:02):\nI've got follow up questions. Can you control where the raccoon take you or are they just deciding on their own what's happening?\n\nDylan Field (09:09):\nI think that raccoons probably wouldn't even agree with each other where to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:14):\nOkay, that's complicated.\n\nDylan Field (09:16):\nIf you had raccoons for feet right now, do you think that it would interfere with this podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:21):\nBut muffin hands would also interfere with my newsletter and I feel like I'd be out of work.\n\nDylan Field (09:25):\nI don't know if you can type.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:26):\nI'd need a special keyboard. This is very difficult.\n\nDylan Field (09:29):\nYou haven't even thought about the upsides of this yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:33):\nWhat are the upsides?\n\nDylan Field (09:34):\nWe can get there, it's all-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:36):\nMaybe I could eat some of the muffins.\n\nDylan Field (09:36):\nIt's the case for optimism.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:37):\nCupcakes?\n\nDylan Field (09:38):\nIf you have muffins for hands, maybe if you're hungry...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:41):\nDo they regenerate as you you eat them?\n\nDylan Field (09:43):\nThat's a good question. There's no answers here, just questions. Do your nails grow?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:49):\nYes.\n\nDylan Field (09:50):\nOh, okay. Interesting. It's deeper than you might think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:58):\nI'm going to play a short clip with Rick Rubin and then I have a question about it. So we'll see if that plays.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:06):\nBut exactly what he does and how is difficult to describe. Do you play instruments?\n\nRick Rubin (10:12):\nBarely.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:13):\nDo you know how to work a soundboard?\n\nRick Rubin (10:15):\nNo. I have no technical ability and I know nothing about music.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:21):\nThen you must know something.\n\nRick Rubin (10:22):\nWell, I know what I like and what I don't like. And I'm decisive about what I like and what I don't like.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:29):\nSo what are you being paid for?\n\nRick Rubin (10:31):\nThe confidence that I have in my taste and my ability to express what I feel has proven helpful for artists.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (10:45):\nSo I'm not going to say this is you. You need to grow the beard. But I think this is a little bit you because what I've heard from a number of your colleagues is that one of your superpowers is intuition and product taste. And someone said that you have the sixth sense for what's going to work, when you're designing Figma and you're making decisions in the product. So I'm curious how you've built and refined your intuition and product taste when it comes to Figma and then even broadly.\n\nDylan Field (11:13):\nThat's a lot kinder than I thought you were going to be. I thought you're going to be like, \"You don't know how to code and you don't know how to design.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:17):\nNo.\n\nDylan Field (11:19):\nBut no, here's my framework for it. I think intuition is like a hypothesis generator and you're constantly generating these hypotheses and others are generating hypotheses as well. And you then take these hypotheses and you put them forward and you debate them and you try to find data to support them or negate them. And then you winnow it down into what is our working hypothesis? And from that you move forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:48):\nI heard that you read every tweet that mentions Figma and share them with folks. There's a Slack channel where you paste them. I imagine that is a part of this where you're just constantly watching what people are saying about Figma, what people are complaining about.\n\nDylan Field (12:00):\nI definitely look everywhere trying to constantly ingest information about Figma, and it's not just Twitter/X, whatever that's called now, but anywhere on the internet, support channels, et cetera. And I'm always trying to understand. I also ask a lot of questions and I try to get to root problems and understand where people are coming from and what are they actually trying to solve. Sometimes people are saying, \"Hey, I need X\", but they really want Y or Z. And trying to do that myself and engage and dive deeper there, but also to encourage our team to do that, I think leads to really good outcomes in terms of what we ship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:51):\nIs there something you've changed your mind about, building on that, either based on customer feedback or some employee just making a case and like, \"Okay, you're right.\" Is there something that comes to mind of something you've changed your mind about recently? Somebody said Flides.\n\nDylan Field (13:09):\nFor when we started out Flides. I have not. It's Figma Slides. Well, it's not recent, but one good example of me changing my mind is that you all have Pages in Figma, you're welcome. But I think I have deep skepticism of Pages still. I'm not sure they're... If you could freeze time and I could just go in with my team, work on Figma for a very long time, I'm not sure we'd come to the same implementation of Pages that we are at today. I just don't think it's the most elegant solution in the context of the entire system of product design that you could create. The world told me and our team that that did not matter and they needed Pages. And don't worry, we're not shipping Pages. But I am still very skeptical of them and I think that in general, probably my team would tell you that I don't always change my mind, but I also build trust with people in deep ways.\n\n(14:22):\nAnd I think across our organization, if things are not going to be fatal, then if I hear from someone, \"Hey, I really think we should do X\", then I'll say, \"Okay, just go with it. And here's my feedback, here's what I'm skeptical of, let's see what happens.\" And then sometimes they come back to me and they're like, \"See I was right.\" But usually they're pretty polite about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:49):\nJust to build on that, something a lot of people try to work on is being good at influencing leadership execs, CEOs. What do you find works to change your mind? What do people come to you with that helps you like, \"Okay, you're actually right?\"\n\nDylan Field (15:05):\nI think the more concrete an artifact is or the more you can debate something, the better. I ask for examples a lot, I try to ask follow up questions about things and make sure I fully understand it. And I think where I get stuck sometimes is if I ask follow up questions and we don't have answers yet, and then my response might be, \"Let's go find the answer to these questions and then let's go back to this conversation\", if I think it's something that's really important. And I think for some people they might go, \"Okay, this is actually really obvious. I can't believe you're so dense and you don't get it yet.\" And sometimes they're right and they come back and they're like, \"Okay, here's the data now, can we move on?\" And we do, we move on and they're right. And I just think that it's important though to just really understand something from first principles for a lot of decisions. And maybe it's just a perfectionist quality repeated over time, I think it leads to good outcomes as long as you make sure it's not bottle-necking the organization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:15):\nSo following up on that, let's talk about product management. So last year you had Brian Chesky here, I think maybe on this stage, maybe a bigger stage. And he said that they got rid of product management at Airbnb and everyone cheered and all the PMs were very sad. And he didn't actually mean they got rid of product management, they changed the function and evolved it. I'm curious just to get your take.\n\nDylan Field (16:38):\nIt's funny. This year we have you here Lenny, so that's your answer. No...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:43):\nI had him on the-\n\nDylan Field (16:45):\nBefore and after, all. Surprise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:45):\nWe're still here. We're still here. I want to get your take on product management. You all have amazing product managers at Figma. I've had three of them on the podcast already. I'm curious just what value you find the best product managers bring to Figma?\n\nDylan Field (17:00):\nIt was really funny last year after that interview, so Yuhki, our chief product officer, had invited me to a dinner for our PM team. And it took a while to get out of Config at the end of the day, and I eventually made the dinner but I was 40 minutes late. And I walk in and Mihika who was on stage yesterday, presenting Figma Slides, Flides, she was standing up and doing a mock Brian Chesky impersonation. And she's standing up in front of the entire product team and she goes, \"And then Brian Chesky's like, 'There don't need to be any PMs.' And Dylan's like... Ooh.\" And I'm like, \"Hi, Mihika.\" And I'd never seen her so red. And then I gave a quick, \"Hey PM team, I believe in you. Thank you for your hard work.\"\n\n(18:08):\nSeriously, I think that if you zoom out, it's always tricky whenever you're asked to formally define, what is the separation between a product manager, a designer, and an engineer? It's always hard to actually create those clear lines. And I think in many organizations they're blurry. But at the end of the day, a PM and designer, they need to have some technical expertise or at least understand how some systems work to probably create the best things they can possibly make. A designer, engineer, they should probably have some sense of the business objectives. They should have some sense of what users want. An engineer and a product manager, they should have taste and craft and some sense of the option space, and some desire to care about the visual implementation.\n\n(19:08):\nAnd I think you can include research in there too, if you want to make it four legs of the stool rather than the trio. And you can talk about all three probably should have exposure to users and be talking in dialogue with users. So I think that if you think about that group holistically, each is important. If you think about a team, there's all these qualities that you have to have to make a great product. And that said, I think for product managers and the product function... I think sometimes when you see people that fall down in that function is because they treat it too much like process. Which is very important too, don't me wrong. Good process can help support good outcomes. But I think that you can't lose sight of the problems that you're solving. You have to go talk to users and you have to actually have a strategy. And if you're really good, you should have a point of view. And some point of views are going to lead to good outcomes and some point of views aren't. And there's some tense sense of taste.\n\n(20:16):\nAnd you also have to bring everyone together and make sure that they get to the objective, that it's celebrated, and that at the end of the project or when you complete a milestone, everyone's stoked. Otherwise, it's not going to be a team that gels, you're not going to get to the next outcome. Even if you get to an outcome and it's a milestone, but if everyone's unhappy, you failed. And so somehow good product people are able to do all this and they're able to create great frameworks that bring everyone along with them. And so everyone's able to have a shared head space around what it is they're trying to get to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:54):\nSomeone once said that if PMs disappeared or if a PM goes on vacation, everything's okay for a week or two or three and then things start to crumble a little bit because they glue everything together. Do you find that sort of thing? Let me actually ask a different question along those lines, are you bearish or bullish on the future of product management? Do you think PMs will continue the way they are? Do you think PMs will dwindle any sense of the future of product management?\n\nDylan Field (21:23):\nI think probably everyone's learning to do a bit more of everyone else's job in this current moment. That said, I definitely think there's still immense value in product, immense value in design, immense value in engineering. And so I think those roles will continue to exist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (21:43):\nSo maybe I just want to come back to the question of just, with the best PMs that you work with, do you find, what value do they most bring? I guess is there anything that's like, \"Here's what would be gone if we didn't have these PMs\"?\n\nDylan Field (21:57):\nThe best PMs, I think again, create those frameworks that bring everyone else along and those frameworks also have a point of view and a strategy associated with them. So you're able to take the strategy, take the point of view, wrap it all up in a framework, and then make it so that everyone knows what the destination is and how to get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:20):\nSo along these lines, something I've heard you're really big on is simplification. Somebody told me that when you're in a designer view and things just feel too complex to you, quote, \"You furrow your brow and insist there must be something simpler.\" Why is simplification so top of mind for you, why is it so important for you and just why is it so hard to do?\n\nDylan Field (22:41):\nOh, gosh. Well, I think probably anyone here who's worked on product knows how hard it is. I think the more that you add, the harder it is to create something that's coherent. One essay that Evan, my co-founder, introduced me to early on in famous history, I think from Stevie's [inaudible 00:23:06] grants or something like that, contains the term irreducible complexity. And it's basically this idea that one plus one does not equal three, it sometimes equals one and a half. And the more that you add and the more that you continue to put in something, the more complex it gets and the worse it gets. And I think this is definitely true for tools.\n\n(23:28):\nSo in the context of Figma, we can make it more powerful, but to do that in a way that's not making it more complex at the same time is extremely hard. And we have to always be paying attention to how complex or how simple things are because if we don't, it just becomes a monstrosity really fast. And there's parts of our product that, I don't want to dive into that part of the conversation, the self-critique, but definitely as I'm in conversation with a bunch of our product leaders at Figma, there's parts where it's like, \"Okay, this thing is too complex as a system and we made all the right local decisions and yet together they're too complex and they're not working anymore. And let's go revisit the system now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by UserTesting. Transform how you build products and experiences with UserTesting.

Is there anything that's been bugging you in the old Figma but like, \"Oh, this is way too complicated, I really want to simplify this thing\"?\n\nDylan Field (25:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:11):\nWhat's that?\n\nDylan Field (25:12):\nWe'll move on, but many things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:18):\nSounds good. And in terms of how to keep things simple, so I had Dharmesh Shah on the podcast, he's the co-founder of HubSpot, and the way he described it is that you're always fighting the second loft through more dynamics of entropy, just the product getting more complicated. And he sees himself as part of the solution, of top down, you have to be on top of that. Is that the way you see it? That's your role, to keep things simple. Do you think people further down the ladder can do that?\n\nDylan Field (25:46):\nAbsolutely, everyone's responsible for simplicity. And I think another quote that is not mine but is a really a good one is \"Keep the simple things simple. Make the complex things possible.\" And I think that's a really important principle to hold as you're designing tools. And I'd say that it's really easy to make the simple things complex, unfortunately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:10):\nI want to pivot to talking about early days Figma. So I don't know how many people know this, but it took three and a half years to launch Figma from when you were beginning to work on it.\n\nDylan Field (26:19):\nWay too long, don't do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:22):\nThis is my question. So it took three and a half years to launch and then five years to get your first customer. Dylan, what the hell were you doing all that time?\n\nDylan Field (26:28):\nI don't think it took five years for a first... Well okay-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:32):\nPaying.\n\nDylan Field (26:33):\nFirst paying customer, sure. Okay, fine. Slightly less but approximately five years, it gets to be round up. I think that if I had been probably better at hiring and recruiting... I see Nadia in the audience, making eye contact with her the entire time, for some reason. She's our chief people officer. If she had been at Figma from day one, we would've hired probably faster and we would've gotten to market faster. But I think that it was a hard product to build and to get everything to come together with. I also see Sho. And I think for... Sho's joined us as a director of engineering. He's a VP of product now. Again, people can wear many hats. And he was someone that joined Figma and said, \"Hey, y'all need to ship this thing, you're really close.\" And he really helped catalyze us to ship in that moment. And I think, in week one, he gave a presentation. It was like, \"Here's what we got to do, here's the gap. Everyone agrees on it. Let's go.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:45):\nYou already said that you wish you shipped earlier. Is there any advice there for just people building something today of-\n\nDylan Field (27:49):\nGet it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build. And FigJam's a great example of that, we shipped it incredibly fast and it helped us get to market and get feedback faster. Figma Slides, great example of that too. Dev Mode, for what it's worth, it took us longer. We just had to keep iterating and building it and building it again. Certain directions we tried didn't work out and we really had to get to a place where we were able to really believe that we were adding value and really understood the developer's user, and it just didn't happen for a long time. So it's interesting because I think people look at Dev Mode and sometimes they go, \"Oh, this is quite simple\", to the point about simplicity.\n\n(28:53):\nFigma, is this simpler than FigJam? And the reality was it took at least three times as long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:04):\nSo your advice is ship quickly. There's also this push the-\n\nDylan Field (29:09):\nI'd hold the bar, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:11):\nThat's the question I have, is there's also a lot of talk of just the bar has risen. You need, especially B2B software, craft is really important. Linear talks a lot about this, just the bar is very high for people to switch from something out there. Is there anything... I don't think you'll have, \"Here's the answer. When you're ready to ship...\", but just any advice of just like, \"Here's good enough\" versus \"No, you should probably wait.\"\n\nDylan Field (29:32):\nWell, another thing that Evan taught me was that for a new launch, you got quality, features, deadline, choose two. And I think that the beautiful thing about software is you can keep iterating on it. So it's not like a physical product where you have to always have quality in there, otherwise it's never going to have quality. You can ship it with features and deadline and then improve it iteratively over time. I'm not saying you should always do that. Sometimes you need to at least have a minimum bar of quality for the things you have and you're going to ship less features maybe.\n\n(30:04):\nSo you choose quality and deadline and sometimes you say, \"Actually here's the minimum feature set and we're going to have this quality bar and you're willing to push it out.\" But I think you have to know when you're introducing a new thing, what it's going to take and then to make that minimally awesome product. But also I think that when you're iteratively improving it, you shouldn't just be focused on the features, you have to focus on the quality too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:33):\nI like this term you use, 'minimally awesome product'. Love it. So the way you got your early users for Figma is quite fascinating. I don't know how many people know this story, but you basically wrote a script to scrape Twitter and create a graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and then you made it your mission to convince them to use Figma and make them evangelists. Is there anything more to the story there? And then I have a question along those lines.\n\nDylan Field (31:01):\nYou can't do this anymore, first of all, because the Twitter API doesn't exist anymore. Rest in peace, Twitter API. But look, I was an intern at LinkedIn and when I was there I saw some really cool work people had done with Gephi, which was a network visualization tool. And based on that I thought it'd be interesting to try to, like you said, look at who the design network was, who the central nodes were, which you can just run [inaudible 00:31:31] on and see. And you could do that for other communities too, which I have done in the past just because I'm curious about social network dynamics and social network analysis.\n\n(31:42):\nAnd you could just do those things back in 2012, 2013 when Figma started. So I constructed this list of, \"Here are the most central designers in the graph\", but also then I looked at their work. And the ones that I was really inspired by as a total fanboy, and someone who wanted to learn as much as I could about design, was inspired by these folks, the ones I was inspired by I reached out to and said, \"Hey, can I buy you a coffee?\" And most of them are really kind. The design community is amazing. And they said yes and then from there was able to learn from them, show them Figma, get their feedback. And I think it started honestly more as me fanboy and me getting feedback.\n\n(32:29):\nOne example is Tim Van Damme. I saw him on Dribble. Max [inaudible 00:32:35], I'm like, \"Oh, my God, this guy is just genius. These icons are incredible.\" I think the first time I met Tim was at Dropbox and think I had this total fanboy moment. I'm like, \"I've been tracing your icons.\" He's like, \"Hi.\"\n\n(32:54):\nAnd I had been working on vector networks with a team, and my test cases were a lot of his icons. Because they were just beautiful and I liked looking at them and studying them. And to now have Tim on the team and have him doing the icons for UI 3 is such an honor, and privileged to work with someone of that craft. So reaching out to your hero sometimes works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:24):\nIt's interesting because when people hear that story, when I've heard that story many times, it was always like, \"Here's a growth hack. Find the most influential people in your field, go try to convince them to use your product.\" And the way you're describing it is you were using it more as feedback. \"I just want to show you the product, get your feedback, make this better\", and then it ended up working. They're like, \"Oh, I love Figma, I'm going to use it.\"\n\nDylan Field (33:43):\nWell, I think it especially works for designers that way, because designers are really good at giving feedback. It turns out that not everyone is good at giving feedback, but designers are awesome at that. So we're really lucky. And literally early on in Figma's existence, folks... I think Payam [inaudible 00:34:00] is here somewhere. I'm not sure if he's in this room, but I was hoping to see him before the end of Config. Payam wrote a very long doc for us about all the things that he wanted to see in Figma after we did a user research study with him. With a bottle of wine because our text editing didn't work very well then. So I ran him through the user study, I knew we'd need a bottle of wine to finish and it took hours. The type of sentence in Figma was so slow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:27):\nThat reminds me of a story I've heard where... One of your first customers was Coda, sponsor I think of Config. It used to be called Krypton. And there's a story where you installed Figma, you helped them get set up, you drove home and then they called you like, \"Hey, Figma is not working anymore.\" And you drove back yourself to help fix them and it ended up their wifi was down or there was a wifi issue. Is that the story?\n\nDylan Field (34:53):\nI don't remember what the solution was, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:54):\nThat's what I heard.\n\nDylan Field (34:56):\n... we were halfway home and somehow I saw... I'm sure I was not looking at my email while driving, definitely is not something anyone here should do. But somehow found out that they had an issue and we turned the car around. Shishir is amazing by the way, and has been a mentor for a long time to me and many people on our team. And he, I think, at the time did not know he was the first customer.\n\n(35:27):\nAnd later on he came over to Figma's office and I introduced him without really thinking about that. And I was like, \"This is Shishir, he's team was really the first user of Figma as a team.\" And he goes, \"Wait a second, I am?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:48):\nI want to talk about something totally different. Something I've noticed you are good at is you spot trends ahead of other people. So obviously WebGL you were on early and that's what allowed Figma to exist, to link it in the browser. I saw you tweeting about CryptoPunks way before they were worth millions of dollars. You're just like, \"Look, CryptoPunks. Look, I got a few, they're really cool. They're super cool, little pipe.\" I'm curious if there's anything these days you're really excited about that might become bigger in the future?\n\nDylan Field (36:15):\nWell, we talked about websim. We were just talking about them backstage and I think before this conversation too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:23):\nTalk about websim.\n\nDylan Field (36:24):\nAnd that's an example of something where it's so interesting because there's a generative UI component and yet it's not what we're going for, for Figma, it's totally different. So we actually invested in websim with Figma Ventures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:39):\nMaybe explain what websim is for folks.\n\nDylan Field (36:41):\nWebsim is a hallucinated internet basically. If you go to websim.ai, you can use different models like Claude or GPT-4o, and you can do that either through their defaults or you can use open router to get a bigger context window. And the more that you use it, the more you construct this context window of this almost universe that you're building up in websim. And as you do it, it's almost like you're world building. And I just have gone deep and geeked out on this when I've had time, and they've evolved the platform a lot.\n\n(37:21):\nSo we were back there and they were showing me some new functionality that's really cool too. But I think it's so interesting to see it as this almost lean forward entertainment tool using the internet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (37:36):\nSo I thought you would answer this and so we're going to have a picture come up here, that I tried websim and played around with it. And hopefully a photo comes up somewhere. So all I typed here was gmail.com/dylanfield. So this is in an invented Gmail. Just came up with this using AI of what your inbox should look like and it looks pretty accurate. There's Adobe stuff-\n\nDylan Field (38:00):\nDOJ, not FTC.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:02):\n... financial. This is not actual information. Nobody buy stock based on this. So it's pretty-\n\nDylan Field (38:09):\nNo comment on 75% year over year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:13):\nSo the way it work-\n\nDylan Field (38:14):\nI hadn't ever tried Gmail before. Did you try you? What was your inbox?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:18):\nI didn't do me. I don't think it would have anything. It'd be like, if it does-\n\nDylan Field (38:21):\nWho are you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:22):\nSo the way it works is just you type a URL or a prompt in the URL field and it'll just invent what that website looks like. It's hilarious.\n\nDylan Field (38:29):\nIt's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:30):\nIt's awesome. So I think they're going to get a lot of traffic right now.\n\nDylan Field (38:32):\nOne time someone posted in our random channel on Slack, they said, \"I had a dream last night.\" It's always a good start for the random channel. \"I had a dream last night that I was working on FigJam, but it wasn't FigJam, it was Frog Jam.\n\n(38:52):\nAnd websim was like figma.com/frogjam and it came up with a whole marketing website complete with toad puns for Frog Jam. The sticky notes were lily pads and you were supposed to... It had this whole metaphor of hopping from lily pad to lily pad to generate new ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:17):\nThis is genius. Interestingly, before Figma, your only other job was an intern at three different companies and now you're leading this juggernaut of a business, a thousand plus people. I imagine there's a lot you've had to learn over this time. So I'm not going to ask you what you've learned because I think it's probably a lot. I'm curious just what has most helped you scale and learn? Is it exec coaches, is it co friends? Is it hiring execs? What's most helped you scale with the business and become the leader you are today?\n\nDylan Field (39:51):\nI think all the above. And also just having a mindset of, you have to constantly adapt and grow and change and adapt. But I would say that mentors can come from anywhere. It can come from the community, all of you. Mentorship can come from the people you hire. It can come from folks that you actively seek out as investors or explicit mentorship and mentors. It can come from people that call themselves coaches. And what's interesting too is it can come from people you mentor as well. There have been plenty of people where they ask me a question at some point and I give them an answer and they think it's insightful for whatever reason. And then years later where we're talking again and I ask them a question and they're like, \"Well, years ago you told me...\" And they repeat back what I told them like, \"That's a really good point.\"\n\n(40:45):\nOr they've grown and they've changed and they've learned and they tell me something completely different. They give me a new framework. And so I think that when you're... A lot of times when I talk with new founders, they teach me things that are totally things that I've just never thought about. Or interns at Figma have been mentors to me, in many ways. So you really have to have a ready mindset and just always be ready to absorb new information, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (41:09):\nWhen you were just tinkering around with Figma 12 years ago, I think at this point, did you ever imagine you'd be running a thousand person company and audience just spell bound by what you're building? There's people lining up to take photos with your logo in the lobby. That doesn't happen. That's very rare. Just to give you a chance to reflect on just how it feels to have built that over time, how does that feel? I'm sitting here right now.\n\nDylan Field (41:32):\nI feel very, very lucky, but also very humbled by just the community that is around Figma. I mentioned in the keynote, but just the people that are in the Figma community are the people that are shaping the world's technology. And the chance to serve them and to make software for them and hopefully improve their life in some little way is such a privilege. It's a responsibility and one I don't take lightly, but also I try not to carry that as a weight, but rather as pump me up and get me excited to go build for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:10):\nWhen we were talking about this idea earlier... The first thing you said is it's a responsibility, which I didn't expect. Is there anything more there just like, \"Wow, I really have to help make...\"?\n\nDylan Field (42:19):\nWell, again, going back to the simplification point, it's very important that we continue to make Figma more and more simple. We make Figma as powerful as we can for the people that are in our community. That we figure out what people's needs truly are and that we advance the state of the craft, make it so that we do that in a responsible way. And that we champion design and champion quality. So we're trying to do all those things. We sometimes mess up, but people have been very patient with us and we're very thankful for that. And thankful for the support of just everyone here and in our community that are giving us a chance to make this impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:06):\nIs there anything else you want to... Oh, there's some applause. Love that.\n\nDylan Field (43:11):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:15):\nApplause break. Is there anything else you want to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very quick lightning round?\n\nDylan Field (43:24):\nWell, no, one thing I'll share is I think we're so early on this journey of computing in general. And in our lifetimes, we're going to have the chance to just build such incredible technology and incredible products. And I'm really excited to see what everyone in this room builds, but also everyone on the internet that [inaudible 00:43:48] maybe also builds and send me cool stuff. If you build something cool, message me somewhere and share it with me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:56):\nWhat's the best way to message you?\n\nDylan Field (43:59):\nEmail's good. You can probably figure out my email if you-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:59):\nJust use websim.\n\nDylan Field (44:03):\n... [inaudible 00:44:03] for five seconds or use websim. Twitter/X is good. Those are two places at least you can find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:12):\nDylan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We only have a couple of minutes left. It's a very short one. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love other than websim?\n\nDylan Field (44:28):\nWell, I'll say that, and it's not like a favorite product, but I will say that if you get... Hesitate if I should say this or not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:45):\nWe'll cut it out in post, don't worry about it.\n\nDylan Field (44:52):\nI'll say this, it's so fascinating to look at all the different LMs out there right now and what each one is uniquely good at. And it's really fun if you can hack them the right way and get them in the right mood, what they'll do. That's what I'll say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:07):\nWhoa, what does that mean?\n\nDylan Field (45:11):\nIt's my diplomatic answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:13):\nInteresting. Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to, repeat to yourself, share with friends or family, that you find really useful?\n\nDylan Field (45:22):\nI don't know if I've got a life motto, but one piece of advice I've always appreciated is when people give you advice, they're not giving you advice, they're giving themselves advice in your shoes. I think that's an interesting one. So if I gave you advice here, I'm giving myself advice in your shoes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:41):\nFinal question. Not many people know this, but you were a child actor when you were five years old. Do you think you made the right career move? Do you feel like you sometimes regret acting?\n\nDylan Field (45:54):\nYes, definitely. That's my mom. My mom's in the audience and she says yes. No. We've been talking about product. If you're an actor, you're a product in some way. And that's not to disparage actors, actors are awesome. Acting is awesome. I loved it. But my differentiators when I was five, five and a half I think, was that I could read and I could sit still and I was decently cute. And I hit puberty and those things were no longer differentiators. And then it was like, let's do some computer science.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:38):\nSo to close, we're going to play a... Oh, applause. We're going to play a clip, something I found on YouTube to close and enjoy. 30 seconds clip.\n\nSpeaker 5 (47:09):\nWhere will you find a world of ideas for your child? Only at eToys. From Barbie to Brio to SwimWays. eToys, where great ideas come to you.\n\nDylan Field (47:22):\nThat was a good find. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 5 (47:27):\nDylan, thank you so much for doing this.\n\nDylan Field (47:28):\nThank you. Can I make one comment about that commercial?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:31):\nOkay, one comment.\n\nDylan Field (47:32):\nOne comment before we end. That commercial made that company go bankrupt. Thank you all for joining. Thank you for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:40):\nGood luck. Thanks Dylan. Bye everyone.\n\n(47:44):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "你的指甲会长吗?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:49):\n会的。\n\nDylan Field (09:50):\n哦,好的。有意思。这个问题比你想的要深刻。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:58):\n我要播放一段 Rick Rubin 的短视频,然后我有个相关的问题。我们看看能不能播放。\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:06):\n但他具体做什么、怎么做的,很难描述。你会演奏乐器吗?\n\nRick Rubin (10:12):\n勉强会一点。\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:13):\n你知道怎么操作调音台吗?\n\nRick Rubin (10:15):\n不会。我没有任何技术能力,对音乐也一窍不通。\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:21):\n那你肯定知道点什么。\n\nRick Rubin (10:22):\n嗯,我知道自己喜欢什么、不喜欢什么。而且对于喜欢和不喜欢的东西,我很果断。\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:29):\n那别人付钱让你做什么?\n\nRick Rubin (10:31):\n我对自己品味的信心,以及表达自己感受的能力,事实证明对艺术家们很有帮助。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (10:45):\n我不是说这就是你。你需要留胡子。但我觉得这有点像你,因为我从你的很多同事那里听说,你的超能力之一就是直觉和产品品味。有人说,当你在设计 Figma 和做产品决策时,你对什么能行有第六感。所以我很好奇,你是如何培养和提升自己在 Figma 方面的直觉和产品品味的,甚至更广泛地说。\n\nDylan Field (11:13):\n这比我想象的要友善多了。我以为你会说,\"你不会写代码,也不会设计。\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:17):\n不会的。\n\nDylan Field (11:19):\n不过,我是这么理解的。我认为直觉就像一个假设生成器,你不断生成这些假设,其他人也在生成假设。然后你把这些假设提出来,进行辩论,试图找到数据来支持或否定它们。然后你把范围缩小到:我们的工作假设是什么?从那里开始往前推进。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:48):\n我听说你会阅读每一条提到 Figma 的推文,并分享给大家。有一个 Slack 频道,你会把它们粘贴在那里。我想这也是其中的一部分,你只是不断关注人们对 Figma 的评价,人们在抱怨什么。\n\nDylan Field (12:00):\n我确实无处不在地寻找信息,试图不断吸收关于 Figma 的信息,不仅仅是 Twitter/X,不管现在叫什么,而是互联网上的任何地方,支持渠道等等。我总是试图去理解。我也会问很多问题,试图找到根本问题,理解人们的出发点,以及他们实际想要解决什么问题。有时候人们会说,\"嘿,我需要 X\",但他们真正想要的是 Y 或 Z。我自己试图做到这一点,参与并深入挖掘,同时也鼓励我们的团队这样做,我认为这会在我们交付的产品上带来非常好的结果。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:51):\n在此基础上,有没有什么事情让你改变了想法,要么是基于客户反馈,要么是某个员工提出了理由,然后你说,\"好吧,你是对的。\" 最近有什么让你改变想法的事情吗?有人说 Flides。\n\nDylan Field (13:09):\n关于我们刚开始做 Flides 的时候。我没有。是 Figma Slides。嗯,这不是最近的事,但我改变想法的一个好例子是,你们现在在 Figma 里有 Pages 功能,不用谢。但我认为我对 Pages 仍然持深深的怀疑态度。我不确定它们是否......如果你能冻结时间,我可以和我的团队一起,花很长时间研究 Figma,我不确定我们会得出今天这样的 Pages 实现方案。我只是不认为在整个产品设计系统的背景下,这是你能创造的最优雅的解决方案。但这个世界和我们的团队告诉我,那不重要,他们需要 Pages。别担心,我们不会取消 Pages。但我对它们仍然持非常怀疑的态度,我认为总的来说,我的团队可能会告诉你,我并不总是改变主意,但我也会以深刻的方式与人建立信任。\n\n(14:22):\n我认为在整个组织中,如果事情不会是致命的,那么如果我听到有人说,\"嘿,我真的认为我们应该做 X\",那么我会说,\"好吧,就这么做吧。这是我的反馈,这是我怀疑的地方,让我们看看会发生什么。\" 然后有时他们会回来对我说,\"看,我是对的。\" 但通常他们都很礼貌。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:49):\n在此基础上,很多人试图做好的一件事就是影响领导层、高管、CEO。你发现什么方法能改变你的想法?人们带着什么来找你,能让你觉得,\"好吧,你确实是对的?\"\n\nDylan Field (15:05):\n我认为一个东西越具体,或者你越能辩论某件事,就越好。我经常要求举例,我试图就事情提出后续问题,确保我完全理解它。我认为有时我卡住的地方是,如果我提出后续问题而我们还没有答案,那么我的回应可能是,\"让我们去找这些问题的答案,然后再回到这个对话\",如果我认为这是真正重要的事情。我认为对某些人来说,他们可能会想,\"好吧,这实际上真的很明显。我不敢相信你这么迟钝,还不明白。\" 有时他们是对的,他们回来说,\"好吧,现在这是数据,我们能继续了吗?\" 然后我们就继续,他们是对的。我只是认为,对于很多决策来说,从第一性原理真正理解某件事是很重要的。也许这只是一种完美主义的品质,随着时间推移,我认为它会带来好的结果,只要你确保它不会成为组织的瓶颈。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:15):\n那么继续这个话题,我们来谈谈产品管理。去年你请 Brian Chesky 来这里,我想可能就在这个舞台上,也可能是更大的舞台。他说他们在 Airbnb 取消了产品管理,每个人都欢呼,所有的 PM 都很伤心。但他实际上不是说他们取消了产品管理,而是改变了这个职能并让它进化。我很好奇你的看法。\n\nDylan Field (16:38):\n有意思。今年我们请你来这里,Lenny,所以这就是你的答案。不...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:43):\n我在播客上采访了他...\n\nDylan Field (16:45):\n前后对比。惊喜。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:45):\n我们还在。我们还在。我想听听你对产品管理的看法。你们在 Figma 有很棒的产品经理。我已经在播客上采访了其中三位。我很好奇,你觉得最好的产品经理能给 Figma 带来什么价值?\n\nDylan Field (17:00):\n去年那次采访后真的很有趣,我们的首席产品官 Yuhki 邀请我参加 PM 团队的晚餐。Config 结束后花了一段时间才出来,我最终赶到了晚餐,但迟到了 40 分钟。我走进去,昨天在台上展示 Figma Slides,Flides 的 Mihika 站了起来,在模仿 Brian Chesky。她站在整个产品团队面前说,\"然后 Brian Chesky 说,'不需要任何 PM。'Dylan 就像...哦。\" 我说,\"嗨,Mihika。\" 我从没见过她那么红。然后我快速说了句,\"嘿,PM 团队,我相信你们。感谢你们的辛勤工作。\"\n\n(18:08):\n说真的,我认为如果你放大来看,当你被要求正式定义产品经理、设计师和工程师之间的区别时,总是很棘手。实际上很难划出那些清晰的界限。我认为在许多组织中,它们是模糊的。但归根结底,PM 和设计师,他们需要有一些技术专长,或者至少了解一些系统是如何工作的,才能创造出他们可能做出的最好的东西。设计师、工程师,他们可能应该对业务目标有所了解。他们应该对用户想要什么有所了解。工程师和产品经理,他们应该有品味和工艺,对选项空间有所感知,并且渴望关心视觉实现。\n\n(19:08):\n我认为你也可以把研究包括进去,如果你想让它成为四条腿的凳子而不是三人组。你可以说这三者都应该接触用户,与用户对话。所以我认为如果你整体考虑这个群体,每个都很重要。话虽如此,我认为对于产品经理和产品职能......我认为有时你看到人们在这个职能上失败,是因为他们把它太当成流程了。这也很重要,别误会我的意思。好的流程可以帮助支持好的结果。但我认为你不能忽视你要解决的问题。你必须与用户交谈,你必须真正有策略。如果你真的很优秀,你应该有观点。有些观点会带来好的结果,有些则不会。这其中有某种品味的感觉。\n\n(20:16):\n你还必须把每个人聚集在一起,确保他们达到目标,庆祝成果,并且在项目结束或完成一个里程碑时,每个人都很兴奋。否则,就不会是一个融洽的团队,你无法达到下一个成果。即使你达到了一个成果,完成了一个里程碑,但如果每个人都不开心,你就失败了。所以优秀的产品人能够做到这一切,他们能够创建出色的框架,把每个人都带上。\n\n所以每个人都能对他们想要达成的目标有一个共同的认知空间。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:54):\n有人曾经说过,如果PM消失了,或者一个PM去度假,一两周或三周内一切都还好,但之后事情就会开始有点崩溃,因为是他们把所有事情粘合在一起。你有这种感觉吗?让我换个角度问这个问题,你对产品管理的未来是看空还是看好?你觉得PM会继续保持现在的方式吗?你觉得PM会逐渐减少吗?对产品管理的未来有什么看法?\n\nDylan Field (21:23):\n我觉得在当下这个时刻,可能每个人都在学习做更多其他人的工作。话虽如此,我绝对认为产品、设计、工程仍然有巨大的价值。所以我认为这些角色会继续存在。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (21:43):\n那也许我想回到这个问题,就是跟你共事过的最优秀的PM,你觉得他们最大的价值是什么?有没有什么是\"如果没有这些PM,我们就会失去的东西\"?\n\nDylan Field (21:57):\n我认为最优秀的PM,再说一次,他们会创建那些能让所有人跟上节奏的框架,而这些框架也包含了观点和与之相关的策略。所以你能够整合策略、观点,把它们都包装在一个框架里,然后让每个人都知道目标是什么以及如何到达那里。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:20):\n说到这个,我听说你非常重视简化。有人告诉我,当你在设计师视图中看到东西感觉太复杂时,引用原话是\"你会皱起眉头,坚持认为一定有更简单的方法\"。为什么简化对你来说这么重要?为什么它对你如此关键?还有为什么做到这一点这么难?\n\nDylan Field (22:41):\n天哪。我想在座任何做过产品的人都知道这有多难。我认为你添加的东西越多,就越难创造出连贯的东西。我记得早期Evan,我的联合创始人,向我介绍了一篇著名的文章,我记得是Stevie的[听不清 00:23:06]之类的,里面包含了\"不可简化的复杂性\"这个术语。基本上就是说一加一不等于三,有时候等于一点五。你添加的越多,放进去的越多,就会变得越复杂,越糟糕。我认为对于工具来说这绝对是真的。\n\n(23:28):\n所以在Figma的语境下,我们可以让它更强大,但要在不让它同时变得更复杂的情况下做到这一点是极其困难的。我们必须始终关注事物的复杂程度或简单程度,因为如果我们不这样做,它会很快变成一个怪物。我们的产品有些部分...我不想深入自我批评的那部分对话,但在我和Figma的许多产品负责人交流时,确实有些部分让人觉得,\"好吧,这个东西作为一个系统太复杂了,我们所有的局部决策都是对的,但放在一起就太复杂了,不再工作了。现在让我们重新审视这个系统。\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:14):\n本期节目由UserTesting赞助。通过UserTesting改变你构建产品和体验的方式。在整个开发过程中获得快速反馈,这样你就能第一次就构建出正确的东西。做出更好的决策,带来更好的业务成果。公司被要求用更少的资源做更多的事。他们需要快速行动,构建满足不断变化的客户期望的体验,而且要比以往更快,同时最小化风险和昂贵的返工。有了UserTesting,你在体验研究方面有了一个值得信赖的合作伙伴。他们赋能用户研究、产品和设计团队通过人类洞察做出更高信心的决策。今天就访问usertesting.com/lenny了解更多。\n\n(24:59):\n我知道你们刚刚重新设计了Figma。我猜这部分原因是事情变得太复杂了,不像我们想要的那么简单。在旧版Figma中有什么一直困扰着你,让你觉得\"哦,这太复杂了,我真的想简化这个东西\"?\n\nDylan Field (25:09):\n有的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:11):\n是什么?\n\nDylan Field (25:12):\n我们跳过这个话题吧,但有很多东西。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:18):\n好的。关于如何保持简单,我采访过Dharmesh Shah,他是HubSpot的联合创始人,他描述的方式是你总是在对抗第二定律,也就是熵增,产品会变得越来越复杂。他认为自己是解决方案的一部分,自上而下,你必须关注这一点。你也这么看吗?这是你的角色,保持简单?还是说组织下层的人也能做到这一点?\n\nDylan Field (25:46):\n当然,每个人都对简洁性负责。我想引用另一句不是我说的但非常好的话:\"让简单的事情保持简单。让复杂的事情成为可能。\"我认为这是你在设计工具时要坚持的一个非常重要的原则。我想说的是,不幸的是,让简单的事情变复杂真的很容易。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:10):\n我想转到谈谈Figma的早期。我不知道有多少人知道这一点,但从你们开始做到发布Figma,花了三年半的时间。\n\nDylan Field (26:19):\n太长了,别这么做。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:22):\n这就是我的问题。发布花了三年半,然后又花了五年才有第一个客户。Dylan,这段时间你到底在干什么?\n\nDylan Field (26:28):\n我觉得获得第一个客户没花五年...好吧-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:32):\n付费客户。\n\nDylan Field (26:33):\n第一个付费客户,没错。好吧。稍微少一点但大约五年,可以四舍五入。我想如果我在招聘和招募方面做得更好...我看到观众席的Nadia,不知为何整个过程都在和她眼神交流。她是我们的首席人力官。如果她从第一天就在Figma,我们可能会招得更快,上市也会更快。但我认为这是一个很难构建的产品,要让所有东西整合在一起很难。我也看到Sho了。我想对于...Sho以工程总监的身份加入我们。他现在是产品副总裁。再说一次,人们可以身兼多职。他加入Figma后说,\"嘿,你们需要发布这个东西,已经很接近了。\"他真的帮助催化了我们在那个时刻的发布。我记得第一周,他做了个演示。就像,\"这是我们要做的,这是差距。大家都同意。我们开始吧。\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:45):\n你已经说过你希望早点发布。对于今天正在构建产品的人,有什么建议吗-\n\nDylan Field (27:49):\n尽可能快地推出。他们告诉你的关于确保快速推出产品的一切都是完全正确的。你推出得越快,得到的反馈就越多。这是积极的事情。现在我们在构建时会优先考虑这一点。FigJam就是一个很好的例子,我们发布得非常快,这帮助我们更快地进入市场并获得反馈。Figma Slides也是很好的例子。顺便说一下,Dev Mode花了我们更长时间。我们必须不断迭代和构建。我们尝试的某些方向没有成功,我们真的需要达到一个我们能够真正相信我们在增加价值、真正理解开发者用户的地步,而这在很长一段时间内都没有发生。所以这很有趣,因为我认为人们看Dev Mode时,有时会说,\"哦,这挺简单的\",就像简洁性那一点。\n\n(28:53):\nFigma,这比FigJam简单吗?而现实是它至少花了三倍的时间。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:04):\n所以你的建议是快速发布。但也有一种说法-\n\nDylan Field (29:09):\n我肯定会保持标准。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:11):\n这就是我的问题,现在也有很多关于标准提高的讨论。特别是B2B软件,工艺真的很重要。Linear经常谈论这一点,人们从现有产品切换过来的门槛非常高。有没有什么...我不认为你会有\"这就是答案。当你准备好发布时...\"这样的答案,但关于\"这已经足够好了\"和\"不,你可能应该再等等\",有什么建议吗?\n\nDylan Field (29:32):\n嗯,Evan教给我的另一件事是,对于一个新发布,你有质量、功能、截止日期,选两个。我认为软件的美妙之处在于你可以不断迭代它。所以它不像实体产品,你必须始终保证质量,否则它永远不会有质量。你可以选择功能和截止日期发布,然后随着时间推移逐步改进它。我不是说你应该总是这样做。有时你需要至少有一个最低的质量标准,那你可能会发布更少的功能。\n\n(30:04):\n所以你选择质量和截止日期,有时你会说,\"实际上这是最小功能集,我们要有这个质量标准,你愿意推迟发布。\"但我认为当你推出新东西时,你必须知道需要什么,然后做出那个最小化的优秀产品。但我也认为当你在迭代改进时,你不应该只关注功能,你也必须关注质量。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:33):\n我喜欢你用的这个词,'最小化的优秀产品'(minimally awesome product)。很棒。那么你为Figma获得早期用户的方式相当有趣。",
