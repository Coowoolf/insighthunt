And so the trap there is that you leave yourself right for disruption in your core because someone else can out invests you in that core. And so if you are the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invests everyone else in that core and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.\nLenny (00:40):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Vijay Iyengar. Vijay is currently head of product at Mixpanel. He actually has a very similar career trajectory to myself where he started as an eng intern at Amazon. Then he was an engineer for a while at Uber, then he became an eng manager at Mixpanel. But then he shifted from an ENG manager to director of product, and now head of product at Mixpanel. You don't often see people moving from an leadership role straight to director of product, so it was really interesting to hear what he took from his eng experience and brought into his approach to product leadership. But we spent the bulk of our time talking about what he's learned from the journey that Mixpanel has been on, where they started with a simple product, then scaled to a number of different products, solving many problems for customers, and then made the hard decision to scale back to just a single core focused analytics product.\n(01:33):\nWe talk about why they made that choice, what they learned about when it makes sense to expand a new product and when you probably shouldn't, and how they approach that organizationally. We also talk about how Mixpanel builds product, how they think about products philosophy, how they prioritize, and also what you're probably doing wrong in how you set up your analytics for your own product. With that, I bring you Vijay Iyengar after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n(01:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming subjective bias, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards, resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. Vijay, welcome to the podcast.\nVijay Iyengar (03:52):\nThank you, Lenny. Great to be here. Huge fan of the pod, and so glad I can contribute.\nLenny (03:57):\nI definitely want to talk about Mixpanel's journey both as a product team and a product. But before we get there, as an engineer, you were in a longtime engineer and then you became a product leader, is there anything you had to unlearn as an engineer in the way you thought about leadership and product and business?\nVijay Iyengar (04:13):\nOne of the things after you've been in engineering for a while is that develop this tendency to immediately respond with no to new ideas. And I think from the engineering perspective, this is because you spend a lot of your time building and maintaining ideas that maybe are half thought out or didn't really go anywhere, and you just feel like the full brunt of the maintenance cost of that. And so you build up the scar tissue and this immune response to say no to new ideas, and it's a hard no, like no, we're definitely not going to do it. And I think I had to unlearn that moving into product because you get a lot of ideas coming from a lot more places in the organization, and ideas are fragile in their agency and it's a hard no can really kill a whole direction that you could potentially go.\n(04:55):\nThey could be very high reach and high impact. So, one thing that I've found is the best way to get to a no, if you ultimately need to get there, is to try to make it work. Start trying to make yes work and document how you've tried to make yes work. And do that earnestly, not as an exercise of just an alternative that you're considering. Try to do it sincerely and get to know after trying to make yes work. And so that's one thing I've been trying to just apply my engineer problem solving brain to do that instead of thinking about how it might not work and saying no.\nLenny (05:25):\nIs that something that you recommend engineers work on looking back? I know as a PM, it's like, oh, I love when engineers say yes. This is awesome. I'm going to actually help everyone learn to say yes. But as an engineer, obviously that's a challenge often. What do you recommend to folks that are engineers currently that maybe want to improve on this or shift in how they think about saying yes, saying no when they're asked about something new?\nVijay Iyengar (05:48):\nI think some of the best engineers that I've worked with actually already do this, but [inaudible 00:05:53] they're able to balance both in their head. So, ultimately this balancing act, you just want on-call, you were woken up three times at 3:00 AM due to various bad ideas, and the next morning you wake up and then stand up, it's like, \"Hey, can we do this new thing?\" You kind of have to have that empathy and do that. So yeah, I think the exercise is just take 10 minutes to consider the idea and just sincerely consider how might we make it work. And if at the end of those 10 minutes, it's like futile and there's no path, it's fine to say no. And it's a good instinct to say no, actually in a lot of cases. But yeah, I would recommend that to engineers. I think it would've been better in my career, for sure, if I had learned that sooner.\nLenny (06:26):\nI want to spend some time on the Mixpanel product journey. It's been an interesting rollercoaster. I think the company's been around for how many years? Since 2010? 2009?\nVijay Iyengar (06:34):\n20009, yeah.\nLenny (06:35):\nSo, I know it started as kind of a very simple product analytics product back in the day. And then as you do with ambitious companies, you look for more problems to solve. You look for more problems to solve from your customers. So as I understand it, you guys added a lot more products to the suite of Mixpanel products. And then I know that there are some challenges with scaling that, and maybe the products didn't stick as much as you're hoping. And what I understand is recently, you moved back to just the single core analytics product. And so I'd love to just hear that journey of what that process was like, what you learned as a product leader and as a company about scaling, expanding, trying to solve a lot of problems, and then coming back to one core straightforward problem.\nVijay Iyengar (07:15):\nMixpanel started in 2009 as provide product analytics to EPD teams. And I think early on, it saw a lot of success because it built this in-house database called Arb, which stands for arbitrary segmentation. And that was necessary because events data, which is the fuel for product analytics, is few orders of magnitude larger than most other types of data that people collect, and so you need a specialized approach to deal with it. And so that I think spurred the first wave of explosive growth, because product analytics was a really burning problem at the time. People were shipping mobile apps like crazy and they needed a solution that could scale, and that was kind of a durable mode for Mixpanel for a while. And I think because we had this SDK that was installed in so many apps and we had this really scalable event collection and analytic interface, it was just natural to expand into a few adjacencies that would leverage those same technologies.\n(08:04):\nSo, the first one was messaging, being able to send targeted messages to users, which is something that's fairly natural, you might want to do, especially if you have an SDK already installed. Yeah. The other aspect that we've added into was data infrastructure and trying to be the single source of truth of data in companies. And what ended up happening was that by 2018, we had this big churn problem. We had something like 40% churn, revenue churn, our core product. And when we dug into, it wasn't that people were churning because they didn't need product analytics anymore. They had the need. They were just churning to competition because we were just not up to the market in terms of the features we had in our core. And when we dug into why that was, it was just that we had a 50% engineering team that was building products across three domains, product analytics, messaging, and data engineering stuff.\n(08:52):\nOur engineering team was just spread too thin to address all of those core gaps in functionality. And so we made a really hard call at the time. We said the hard no to those two other categories and decided to focus our entire engineering team on closing the gap on product analytics and innovating there. And from a process standpoint, how we operationalize this was we threw away all our planning and all the execution and that we work that we'd planned to do so far, and we did something very simple. We took all the churn reasons that our customer success and sales teams had been painstakingly collecting for years, grouped them by category, which was roughly product features we needed to build, sorted descending by ARR, took the top 10 things and made that our roadmap, just give every engineer direct access to customers and give them a bucket to go work on, which I think goes against about a million product best practices out there of just doing that.\n(09:41):\nBut I think given the context at the time, we needed to optimize for speed, and speed comes when you have extreme clarity on what you want to do and focus. And so we really just optimize for speed in that time. And so in that first year we moved really quickly and we shipped something like a hundred features in that year and closed a lot of gaps. Again, these are all vanity metrics. Measuring number of features doesn't mean anything.\nLenny (10:04):\nAnd what year was this by the way?\nVijay Iyengar (10:06):\nThis is 2018 to 2019.\nLenny (10:09):\nGot it.\nVijay Iyengar (10:09):\nYeah. So, we moved really fast shipping all these features and instantly saw the improvements to win rate and to retention. But one of the cracks that started to emerge was we neglected the holistic design of our product at the time, right? And if you're shipping features that quick leads, you don't have time to stop and think, where does this go, and how does this fit into our overall system architecture? And what started to happen was that we were hitting diminishing returns with some of these features. And not considering the holistic design and consistency meant the reach of every feature was low. You had to rebuild it for every part of the product that we were in. And so at the time we made... We spun up the second stream that was very design led. And I think this was also coincided around the time we adopted Figma, and it's a really broad design at seat at the table of the company, and we just set up this goal to make design one of our key differentiators.\n(10:53):\nSo, this design driven initiative was really about how can we think about the system architecture of our product? What are the key building blocks of Mixpanel? Where do they need to fit? How few of them can we have, which is a really important step? And then how will users discover them and how do they relate to each other? But I think this realization was born out of the fact that so many great products win or lose based on their architecture. I think Notion, for example, that pages in blocks architecture is so strong, and you can hang so many features off of those core building blocks in a way that has such high impact on region and discovery of those features.\n(11:26):\nSo anyway, we did that in parallel with the.... And continued that grind on core jabs. And so the end result of that phase, which is from 2018 to maybe late 2021, 2022, was our retention went from about 60% to 90%, and our NPS went from 16 to 50. So I think, yeah, there's a lot in there to unpack, but refocusing on the core really helped us achieve those results.\nLenny (11:52):\nGot it. Yeah. I have a lot of questions about this. So interesting. So, that phase that you went through where you sorted things by potential ARR, was that the phase of expanding to multiple products or that was post we're going to focus on analytics and go all in there?\nVijay Iyengar (12:06):\nOh, that was post focusing on analytics.\nLenny (12:08):\nOkay.\nVijay Iyengar (12:08):\nYeah. Yeah.\nLenny (12:09):\nAnd you're saying that you had a stream of just builds all the features that were lacking that are causing customers to churn, and in parallel, there was a track of let's build this product, such that it all connects and works together well and it's really well thought through long term?\nVijay Iyengar (12:24):\nThe first thing, I might have made it seem like it was just the buckets were features. We did take the step of turning them into problems and being clear, exposing engineers directly to the customers that had those problems and then invent a solution to solve them. So I mean, loosely there were features involved, but a lot of them were kind of core problems we needed to solve.\nLenny (12:40):\nThat first approach is so interesting. It's kind of like, yes, we will make more money if we focus on these features. To your point, it ends up being just a bunch of features and products that kind of maybe don't synergize. Looking back, was that a good idea to approach it that way, at least for a while?\nVijay Iyengar (12:54):\nIt highly depends on your context. In a very competitive context where there are just table stakes features that customers need and that it's been validated by the market, you need to optimize for speed more so than anything else. But it is an approach that outlives it's usefulness pretty fast, and we've put that approach behind us relatively quickly after that phase. And I would actually say that design driven phase was the next phase, where it was, okay, we're not bleeding on the table stakes anymore, but we want to make a holistic product that has high reach, high impact on the features and is actually usable. And so that was I think a follow-on phase that's necessary. Obviously, depending on your particular circumstances and competitive dynamics, you can sequence them differently, but I think it was the right call to just... Sort of the on-call thing again where when you're in trouble, you got to get out of trouble. You can't mow your lawn while your house is on fire. You kind of put out the fire and then deal with everything else.\nLenny (13:47):\nYeah.\nVijay Iyengar (13:47):\nSo, that's kind of the approach we took.\nLenny (13:49):\nWhat's an example of a feature or product that you launched within that first track? And then what's an example of something that came out of the designer led approach, if anything comes to mind?\nVijay Iyengar (14:00):\nI think out of the first track, oh man, there's so many that were just core. We didn't have a good cohorts product at the time, just being able to create behavioral cohorts users and create them from any report that we built, right? And I think that, I mean it's just table stakes and analytics to be able to do that. So, that was one of the first things we built, and it was fairly obvious. There's a lot of other things in more advanced types of funnel analytics and a flows and visualization that was really interactive. I think on the design-led phase, the biggest thing I think was visualization consistency and making our charts interactive in a consistent way across our entire product. And so there's two things that enabled. One was that every time we added a new visualization or a new enhancement to a visualization or how something is sorted in one report, it just instantly applied everywhere.\n(14:46):\nSo, just the reach was multiplied for everything we added. And the other thing is it just made the product more accessible, let us add dark mode. So, it made our visualizations really stunning and really easy to see what the takeaways were. And then every new visualization we added inherited all those benefits.\nLenny (14:59):\nI'm trying to think about being at a company that goes through this phase of, \"Hey, we're just going to build a bunch of stuff that we know we need.\" And it feels like hearing it, it's like, \"Oh yeah, and then we're just going to make it all look great and connect and work well.\" I imagine that wasn't planned, and I imagine that wasn't easy to get people to maybe slow down on just building more products and features or push it in a direction where it's all going to make sense. Can you talk at all about what that process was, how hard it was to shift from we're just going to knock through all this checklist of things to let's just bigger, let's slow down, let's spend a lot of time designing?\nVijay Iyengar (15:35):\nIt was definitely more messy internally than I described it. One of the key junctures was when we had this really talented design team and we were putting them on these very tactical projects that was, frankly, that was very engineering led, right? And design would often come in at the end and be asked like, \"Hey, can you just make this look nice and put some pixels on it?\" And it's just such a waste of your design team to have them do that. But at the same time, the pace was so high that they didn't have time to come up for air and do anything else. And so there's actually this moment where I was an engineering manager at part of this.\n(16:05):\nAnd had a meeting with our BM and our head of design at the time, and we said, \"Hey, we can actually do the next three months of projects about any design,\" which was a kind of controversial thing to say, \"but we're doing this so that you can take three months with a set of designers and go think about the system architecture of the product, and we'll wait for that to be done before we do any architectural things that might impact the architecture.\" And I think that gave designers a bit of breathing room to go do that, just separating them for a bit from the tactical fire. Because what was happening instead was we would get towards the end of the project, bring design in, and they would use each project as an opportunity to squeeze in like, oh, and we can simplify here. And that's just a classic way to blow up scope at the end of the project because there wasn't a dedicated space for design led projects.\n(16:48):\nAnd I think that that was kind of a key friction point that we ultimately had to decouple for a bit, and then regroup and say, \"Okay, now we'll look what's our strategy,\" and just take on projects purely for the sake of improving consistency, reach depth of our UX.\nLenny (17:02):\nAlso, looking back, the process you went through adding a bunch of products to solve more customer problems, something every founder and product team thinks about, when should we add new product lines? When should we expand beyond the core? I'm curious what you take away as a lesson and what you'd advise other founders and companies when it comes to when is the time to expand and think about a new product and a third product and a fourth product?\nVijay Iyengar (17:28):\nI don't know if there's a hard and fast rule here. I can just maybe say what made sense and didn't make sense in our context. The issue for us at the time was that we took people away from the investment in our core product to go do those other things. We moved people, right? And so the trap there is that you leave yourself ripe for disruption in your core because someone else can out invest you in that core. And so if you, you're the leader in some core product, our takeaway here is you should continue to out invest everyone else in that core, and then invest the profits that come out of that core into the next venture. Invest profits and not people, or venture capital, which is maybe net present value of profits or something to that effect. But don't take people away from the core to go to these other things because then you end up distracted.\n(18:10):\nAnd the other aspect of that is that those secondary products we took on were in categories of their own. And it's really tempting and you'll often get dragged into accidentally entering another category, and then you'll end up building these bolt-on products that are the best in their category, right? And the adjacent categories for analytics are CDPs or message targeting or feature flagging or something, but there's not that many people that need the sixth best CDP or the eighth best feature flagging or the 10th best message targeting tool. And it ends up being, in aggregate will contribute five to 10% to your revenue, won't seriously accelerate your growth rate, and then takes engineers away from the core product. And so those were the circumstances that we were.\n(18:50):\nAnd I think if you're seeing churn to your competitor on your core product and you're not best in class on any of the other ones, then maybe it's time to reevaluate. And then the last thing I'll say there is that it's also 10x more painful than you think to cut mild successes than anything else, and just organizationally painful. And there's teams that have whole roadmaps, and it's a really painful experience, so you have to think really hard before you kick those off.\nLenny (19:18):\nThat is really, really insightful advice, makes me think about if you bundle good enough solutions, there needs to be kind of this anchored tenant that I will not give this thing up and I'll use the third best version of something else, if you have it. But if you're not that valuable and important, you're not going to convince people to use something because they're competing against the best in every category.\nVijay Iyengar (19:39):\nExactly. Yeah.\nLenny (19:40):\nThat is really interesting. I've been doing this kind of series on how different companies approach building product and I have a few questions I'd love to ask around the product development process and Mixpanel.\nVijay Iyengar (19:50):\nSure.\nLenny (19:51):\nThe first is just like, how do you plan? How do you plan? I know it evolves, but just how do you plan currently? How long are your planning cycles? How far ahead do you plan in detail? Do you use OKRs? Maybe let's start there, those three kind of sub-questions.\nVijay Iyengar (20:04):\nWe have these unsolved problems and analytics that we're going after. For us that’s like, people always want more power, more simplicity, better data trust, faster onboarding, better collaboration, better price performance. And so we largely organize our teams around those problems and those missions. One quick aside there is that some of those problems have attention with each other. Power and simplicity, there's a trade off there, right? And we want one team to own both, so that they're kind of forced to confront that tension and beat that trade off. And so that's kind of how we think about generally our product team, is these cross-functional EPD teams, each of which that's focused on solving these long-lived paired problems for customers [inaudible 00:20:41] our core analysis team focused on that power, simplicity, trade off problem. In terms of planning, the way it works is that we plan on a six month time horizon. And I can talk about our most recent planning cycle actually, because we're just completing it.\nLenny (20:53):\nYeah, let's do it.\nVijay Iyengar (20:54):\nYeah, basically it started out with this strategy memo that our leadership team wrote that basically just conveys this is where we want to go as a company in the next year, and here's how the product team can contribute most of that and just established these key pillars. We shared that with the teams, and they took that and also combined that with all the quantitative and qualitative context they're constantly consuming about the problem they're working on and our customers, and ideated and developed the series of bets for the next six months, which I think are some extent similar to OKRs, where ABET... The anatomy of ABET is that it's problem we want to solve, our hypothesis on the solution, and then some plan to win, some plan to actually get there and a way to measure that you got there.\n(21:32):\nAnd I think one of the unique things that we did relative to other companies that do planning is... I think it usually is sort of this W process of there's the strategy memo, and then teams generate bets and there's a review, and then they go back and I iterate and then they finalize. And we kind of collapsed the middle part of the W where myself and our head of design actually spend time with each of the teams actually ideating on the bets and participating in the solution discovery process, going into the jam sessions and adding fig must keys ourselves with ideas and thoughts on things, which we did because we aren't a huge product team, and we are not going to do 50 things and a half. We're going to do maybe 10 to 12 things.\n(22:12):\nAnd so that's enough that we don't... We can do something that doesn't scale if that enables high bandwidth communication between us and the teams. And it ends up being more messy and unstructured ABET in that phase because we're in there contributing ideas as well. But by the end of it, I think the team leaves feeling both more competent in their bets because there's more thought that's gone into it, and then more aligned top to bottom line why we made certain decisions. And so I think that that's one thing that's different. And then we conclude that process with the roadshow where we presented the rest of the company, and then get their feedback as well.\nLenny (22:41):\nHow long is this process generally?\nVijay Iyengar (22:43):\nThe teams did pre-work for a couple of weeks, like two weeks in December, and then we did a two week sort of sprint on solutioning and ideation in January, the first two weeks of January.\nLenny (22:53):\nAwesome. And what's the end result of planning for each team? Did they deliver a document with, here's our strategy, here's the big bets, here's a roadmap? Is there a template you pass around? How do you get to a thing that people share and present and comment on?\nVijay Iyengar (23:10):\nYeah, I think there's basically three artifacts that are kind of linked to each other. So, the first is we use Notion, and so we have a database in notion called bets, which is where each page in the database is [inaudible 00:23:22]. And that has a template, yeah. So, it's kind of roughly what I described with a few more sections of what problem we're solving? What's the evidence of demand? What's the region impact of this problem? How do we know we're successful? And then what's the key driving hypothesis behind the solution? And then a rough line. And then that's tied with a presentation that's kind of like a tight summary of that that has one slide per bet, and then is also tied with more of an execution focused, how do we sequence and staff this thing and eliminate dependencies, which the engineering team contributes to. So, I think those are the three artifacts that are linked together.\nLenny (23:54):\nThis episode is brought to you by lemon.io.

Can you talk a bit about that and how you advise your product teams to prioritize?\nVijay Iyengar (25:17):\nOne really common framework in prioritization is RICE, reach, impact, confidence, effort. And I think it's simple and fairly robust, which is generally good qualities of a framework. But one of the traps with RICE that we observed is that the C and E, the confidence and effort tends to cause you to prematurely deprioritize potentially high reach, high impact bets, really innovative things. And we encountered this on one of our teams early last year were we just RICE'd everything, all the ideas, and a lot of the high reach, high impact things ended up at the bottom because confidence and effort were just so murky for them, as they should be typically for high reach, high impact ideas.\n(25:55):\nAnd so one exercise that we push our teams on is just ignore the C and E for a little longer than it's comfortable, and just sit with those high reach, high impact ideas with engineers and designers in the room committed to actually trying to solve them. Give it a fair shot. And you'll often find if you spend a week on that set of ideas, you can get pretty far in understanding the confidence and the effort. You can probably find a higher confident lower effort way to do them. Then add the C and E back in, and then RICE as usual. And the goal is to end up with a reasonable mix of innovative bets, incremental bets, and then ones that are technical debt or product debt that you need to address.\nLenny (26:31):\nI usually just cut out the C myself. I find that it's not that powerful. Do you do this in a Google Sheet? Do you use this in Notion? How do you actually recommend teams do this prioritization, or just eyeball it?\nVijay Iyengar (26:43):\nI'm not super opinionated on the exact tools that teams use. I think this is a team local exercise typically, but most teams use Notion and just simple tables or databases in Notion-\nLenny (26:51):\nSweet.\nVijay Iyengar (26:52):\n... work fine for this. I think the other thing on prioritization that's always tricky is estimation. And every engineer will value you estimates are all lies, and if you say it'll take eight weeks, it'll take eight months. But I think the core problem with estimation is you're asked to estimate things before what the thing is, and it's just a strange output to be expected to produce. And one approach that I found really interesting is from this book called Shape Up by Basecamp, which this idea of appetite overestimates, where instead of making the estimate an output of planning, you make the time box or an appetite the input, and you say, \"We want to solve X problem and we're willing to invest six weeks solving that problem.\"\n(27:31):\nThe obvious question there is how do you pick that time window? It just seems arbitrary. And so the base camp people suggest just pick six weeks for everything, and they're really austere about if you can't scope hammer something down to six weeks, you're doing it wrong, which I think is... It can work and has a lot of benefits if you creates a rhythm in your company, but one approach I found that works better is pick a reasonable sounding appetite and just explore the two to three options around it. Pick six weeks, and then say, \"What would we do differently if we only had four weeks or eight weeks?\" And you'll kind of naturally find the efficient frontier of cost and impact, and then align on that. And the important thing is that you check in after that time period and say, \"Is there any new information that's just we should continue? Did we uncover the biggest risks, and are we just on the long tail of things?\" And actually be honest with yourself about that. I think that's important regardless of what framework you use.\nLenny (28:23):\nI really like that. So, is that how you actually operate, you create a time box, we have four weeks for this project, whatever we get done, we ship whatever we don't, we push out?\nVijay Iyengar (28:30):\nWe operated that way in engineering, particularly on the infrastructure side, because we have this series of projects that would just take forever, and the longer it takes, the longer it's going to take. And so we've done that exercise quite a bit. I'd say more on the more engineering heavy projects than others, but we're starting to adopt it more in the product side as well. The main exercise we've taken on the product side is more the consider, what would you do differently with different time boxes approach?\nLenny (28:56):\nJust a thought exercise.\nVijay Iyengar (28:58):\nYeah, it's a good thought exercise. Then it just forces everyone to truly score the requirements. Critical, nice to have, is nice, but really if in two weeks, you're going to get pulled off to do something completely different, what would be a complete solution that addresses the core problem. And it forces you to peel the meat of the problem in first, as opposed to just doing the things that are surrounding it.\nLenny (29:17):\nThat's cool. I really like that. I've done that myself. I'm curious if anyone ever does the shape up process for real or it's just like we will ship anything that is ready within six weeks and not actually have specific deadlines or kind of concrete goals of products they need to ship in specific ways.\nVijay Iyengar (29:32):\nYeah. Well, I think the shape up process, if you run it all the way. They do... Their idea is that you can actually predict on a six week time horizon. So, you can just hammer down scope to something that is complete. It needs to be complete. It can't be milestone one that's like a half baked thing in six weeks, which I think that rigor... The rigor they applied to that across the board, you need to do it all the way. You can't adopt the process halfway. I think the is the challenge. Otherwise you end up with people shipping milestone one and then moving on, which is not the complete product.\nLenny (30:01):\nMakes sense. A couple more questions around how you build product. You mentioned that you have a unique approach to keeping product teams close to customers. And I'm curious what you've learned there, what you found to be helpful and just kind of keeping product teams close to your customers.\nVijay Iyengar (30:15):\nI think this is one thing that is something we invested in pretty early on at Mixpanel. Actually around that time, in 2018, when we refocused on our core product, one of our sales engineers, Aaron, built this automation where he piped all these customer gaps that we got that were reported by our customer success and sales teams, piped that into Slack and just a feed. And what this created was this culture where all engineers and designers could consume that raw feed of direct points of customer with no gatekeeper, no process to access it, no pre-aggregation, right? And I think this scale's pretty far. At a product team of our scale and with our reach of customers, we don't get so much feedback that someone couldn't read it in 20 minutes every day. And for four or five years in engineering, every day I would read all the gaps that we got, and many engineers would do that.\n(31:04):\nAnd one of the rituals that it's enabled is we'll find that engineers will go into that channel and react with a message with an email emoji, which means I'm going to email this customer and find out more, right? And they'll just email the customer and say, \"Hey, I'm the engineer that built this feature. I saw you said this specific thing. Can you tell me more? I'd love to understand.\" They ask the five why's, and then they improve the product on their own. And I think that culture is just so important, and it just empowers all engineers and designers to think a PM a little bit, which I think takes a little bit of a load off on the PM to be the gatekeeper of all that information.\n(31:39):\nAnd then over time, we've evolved it quite a bit as our data stack stack's involved. So, we now not just take customer requests, but we take things that are posted on Twitter and NPS survey feedback and win loss notes from our competitive deals and pipe them both into Slack and into Notion so that we can both get the realtime feed, and then we can sort and aggregate and tag things accordingly. But the key artifact of this is that it's all open. There's no gatekeeper behind that process.\nLenny (32:04):\nThat sounds both amazing and wild. Do you still allow engineers just to email customers and ask them questions about this stuff, or is that harder to do it as you've grown?\nVijay Iyengar (32:12):\nOh no, we still allow that. Yeah.\nLenny (32:14):\nWow, that's awesome.\nVijay Iyengar (32:15):\nOne nice thing about the stack actually, the data stack, is that... So, basically all these feeds information land in our data warehouse, which is BigQuery. And from there, they're pushed out via a reverse CTL tool we use called Census to Slack and Notion that make the note code. But one of the benefits of that is that we can enrich all of these feeds with who's the account? What's their ARR? Who's the CSM? And all that other contact information. So, it's usually not an engineer's blindly reaching out to a customer without letting a CSM know if it's a million dollar account or something. The idea is just trust them with that context, and they can tag the right people and make the right call on that.\nLenny (32:50):\nI'm so curious how that gets prioritized and how PMs are looped into all that, but we don't have to get too deep in that. That's a really cool process. I haven't seen that before. Our engineers were just emailing customers, digging into questions and problems.\nVijay Iyengar (33:01):\nThe trap of course is what you just called out is you can't be reacting to everything all the time. And certainly if you ship a redesign, the first two weeks of that, there's going to be a bunch of feedback that's like, I hate this. Go back. And I think that's sort of an organizational muscle you have to build, balance the reaction, and that's just a thing we've had to practice doing, but I think the trade offs are worth it.\nLenny (33:20):\nAwesome. One last question along these lines, can you just talk about the tools you use, the SaaS products you use to run your product team for collaboration, communication, notes, docs. You mentioned Notion as an example.\nVijay Iyengar (33:31):\nI think our stack is actually fairly standard these days. So, we have Slack, Zoom for communication, Notion for docs and any long form writing, and it's a [inaudible 00:33:42] database, and Figma and FigJam for design and whiteboarding. I think what's actually more interesting is our data stack and the productivity we get out of that. I briefly touched on this, where basically all of our data gets EPL'd out of all the systems we have, lands in BigQuery, gets joined and modeled, and then pushed out via census to all the other tools in our stack. And I think that's been a huge productivity unlock because you can build internal tools with very little code. If you can write SQL, you can build an internal tool basically, and that pushes information to the teams that need it. And so that, I think, just has unlocked a lot of these types of things like automating qualitative signals with no code in a reliable way.\n(34:22):\nAnd then if someone like, \"Oh, can I get ARR on this?\" Yeah, sure it takes two seconds to do that. So, I think that data stack has been a huge productivity unlock for us.\nLenny (34:29):\nAwesome. Have you guys shared that anywhere online, just to show kind of the stack you guys have built?\nVijay Iyengar (34:33):\nWe have a couple blog posts that talks about our stack for... We use this both for our PLG infrastructure and our product, let sales, defining a PQL and alerting a new user who fits that criteria, but then we also use it for internal tools. We have a few blog posts on that topic.\nLenny (34:48):\nSweet. We'll follow up and include some of that in the show notes.\nVijay Iyengar (34:51):\nYeah, definitely.\nLenny (34:53):\nFinal line of questioning, you're one of the smartest people in the world on product analytics heading product for Mixpanel. I'm curious what you think most people get wrong when they're setting up product analytics for their site, their product, their company.\nVijay Iyengar (35:08):\nIt's maybe a bit of a hot take because I think so many people-\nLenny (35:11):\nThere we go.\nVijay Iyengar (35:12):\nYeah, so many people still do this, but I think the biggest mistake is setting up analytics using client side SDKs, client side tracking. So, web and mobile SDKs, putting a mixpanel.track or segment.track in your web app or your mobile apps. And reason it's a hot take is that for many people that's product analytics and SDK tracking are synonymous. They're like, \"All right, Mixpanel means SDK, I have to put an SDK in my web and mobile app. But that's a mistake because it... We've just seen time and time again, it leads to poor data quality and difficulty to maintain that data. So, the problem on web is, just due to app blockers and other unreliable things, in the JavaScript world, you end up dropping 20 to 30% of your events, and so it just doesn't match your internal databases.\n(35:55):\nAnd then on mobile there's two problems. The first is that you have to reinvent tracking for both iOS and Android because it's two different languages and two different platforms, generally speaking. And so you end up with many duplicate events that semantically mean the same thing, but are just different because of the two platforms, and you might have two teams owning that. And the second issue, which is I think even worse, is that you are kind of beholden to clients updating their mobile app to get to the latest version that has your latest tracking. So if you want to add new tracking, it'll only apply to people at the latest version and beyond. Whereas yet all of your old tracking, whether it's broken or you made a mistake, is still out there in the wild, and so you're constantly getting events that are old and broken.\n(36:32):\nAnd so what we recommend instead, and that we've seen a lot more customers adopt recently is just track events from your servers instead of your clients. And that has three benefits. One, it's instantly cross platform. Web and mobile and TV and whatever other platform, they're all going to go through your servers, so you instantly get a hundred percent reach. The second is it's in an environment you control. So if you want to update tracking, you can update it and updates for a hundred percent of users. And then the third thing is that... And this is I think maybe unintuitive, but it's true, is that engineers have been tracking events from servers forever. It's called logs, right? And events are just logs where they user ID in them. And so they don't need to deal with learning a new SDK and dealing with all of that. They just have to track logs that have some structure and a user ID in them. They're tracking events.\n(37:18):\nAnd so if it's easier for the developer, it'll get done in a higher quality way. So, I think the really simple advice there is just start tracking events from your servers instead of from your clients. And if you need to supplement it later on with context that's only on the client, you can add that on later, but server side should be the default.\nLenny (37:34):\nMaybe a last question is just what's changed most and how companies work with analytics in the past few years? And then just where do you think things are going in the space of analytics?\nVijay Iyengar (37:43):\nYeah, so I think one huge trend is the rise of the data warehouse. So these are Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and they're really scalable and they speak this SQL standard, which has led to this explosion of tools that have emerged around them and make it really easy and cheap to load data into the data warehouse, and then also easy to push data out of the data warehouse by tools that can just do that. And this has a few implications. So, the first is that the data warehouse becomes the center of gravity for all data in your company. Whether it's product marketing and sales data, they all land there. And I think that's really valuable today in this product led growth world, and a lot of incus filled my bad. But from a data standpoint, that means all these teams need to be operating off of the same version of the truth, and that version of the truth is sitting in the warehouse, and it just needs to be joined correctly.\n(38:33):\nThe second thing in terms of where things are going is the events, a time series of users at this action at this time, are the universal data model for analytics. And the reason for that is every action, every interaction a customer has, whether it's with your sales team, like a gong call, or with your marketing team, they clicked on that or viewed marketing article or their product, which is more well known, those are all events. They can all be modeled as events. And it's super granular, super intuitive as a way to understand what people are doing. And it's really powerful, because oftentimes you want to ask questions about sequences of events, right? Which user has spent this much time on my pricing page and then looked at three developer docs? That's probably a user I want to reach out to. So many things can be modeled off of that.\n(39:17):\nAnd so I think data warehouse is becoming the loading dock for all this data, which can be very easily modeled this events, but it's not a very great analytical tool for events because SQL is optimized for rows and tables and joints, and not events and sequences of events and segmentations of events. And so one of the things that we're spending a lot of time thinking about is how do we get that really rich, trusted, comprehensive dataset from the data warehouse into a tool that's optimized from the UI down to the data model for events, because that unlocks really fast intuitive exploration of data on dataset that people already have in trust? So, that's, I think, one of the big trends we're excited about and what we see as the future.\nLenny (39:56):\nInteresting. And you think Mixpanel is in a good place to help people do that? Is that how see this, there's something that companies like yours will help people solve, or is this something everyone's going to have to figure out for themselves, or there's like a whole new class of startups launching to help them make the mess out of data warehouses?\nVijay Iyengar (40:11):\nNo, there's always a new class of startups joining in the analytics space. It's never dull moment. Yeah, I think this is something that we are looking to solve, because I mean, analytics only as good as the data. And if people are already collecting great data in the warehouse, I mean we integrate with the warehouse really well, then we get access to that good data. Increasingly, what we've been seeing is that companies like in the reverse ETL phase, like Census and Hightouch are effectively reinventing the CDP reinventing, data movement tool like segment on top of the data warehouse. And so really our strategy there is just tightening our integration with those tools. And we've seen just huge growth and people using their data warehouse as the source for events, not adding SDK tracking anywhere, and just saying, \"I already have events sitting here. I trust all of them. They're from all parts of my business. Why can't I do analytics on my support tickets and my gong calls just as easily as I can do it about my user behavior.\" And so I think that's something we're seeing and we're investing in.\nLenny (41:04):\nAwesome. Anything else you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\nVijay Iyengar (41:09):\nYeah, we opened talking about the transition from engineering to product, and I think one of the things that's just been really fruitful in my career, both on the engineering side and product side, is just adopting that product mindset and getting closer to customers, consuming the raw feed of customer context, taking every opportunity to talk to them. And I'm really excited to see things like this podcast and your newsletter and other forums for engineers to also develop that product mindset then and get closer to customers, because I think long term, that just means better products and services at lower and lower prices, which is just innovation. So, I'm really excited to see more of that in the world.\nLenny (41:45):\nHere, here. With that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got six quick questions for you. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast. Whatever comes to mind, just share, and we'll see how it all goes. Sound good?\nVijay Iyengar (41:57):\nSure. Let's do it.\nLenny (41:58):\nOkay. What are couple books that you recommend most to other people?\nVijay Iyengar (42:02):\nOn the business book standpoint, there's this book called The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. And it's kind of an old book, but I like it because it's sort of written in this fast-paced thriller model. It's like a fiction book, but it's about this idea of the theory of constraints, finding constraints in a system and how you can remove them to improve productivity. So, I found it's just a fun read, and also really insightful non-technical books that I recommend to folks, particularly those that live in SF, which is Cool Gray City of Love by Gary Kamiya, who is a longtime SF president. And it just goes into the history and the communities, and even the geography of San Francisco, and I've just discovered so many little pockets in the city from reading that book, so it's something I recommend to people who live in San Francisco.\nLenny (42:46):\nWhat's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than this podcast?\nVijay Iyengar (42:50):\nI'll do non-tech one for this. So, I'm a huge fan of the show The West Wing, and so there's this podcast called The West Wing Weekly that goes into each episode of the West Wing and brings in actors from the show, as well as folks from government to talk about each episode, and it's just a delight to listen to if you love The West Wing.\nLenny (43:06):\nWait, so they go back to the old show, The West Wing and talk about old episodes with politicians?\nVijay Iyengar (43:11):\nYeah.\nLenny (43:12):\nThat's cool.\nVijay Iyengar (43:12):\nYeah.\nLenny (43:13):\nWow.\nVijay Iyengar (43:14):\nExactly. So, the show's over. The podcast is over.\nLenny (43:18):\nOh, okay.\nVijay Iyengar (43:18):\nYou have all seven seasons, but I think it started in 2016 or 2015 or something.\nLenny (43:22):\nGot it. So cool. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\nVijay Iyengar (43:27):\nPretty mainstream TV tastes. So, I really enjoyed We Crushed and Severance. Those are two good shows I really enjoyed last year.\nLenny (43:35):\nAwesome. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you're interviewing?\nVijay Iyengar (43:39):\nI'm a big fan of open-ended questions, and so one of the questions I ask in the behavioral interview at the start is, walk me through the story of you from college to now, or high school to now, if they're a more junior candidate. And couple interesting things here, interesting to see where people spend most of their time talking and where they don't, and also how they describe the other people on that journey. And do they use a standard framework to describe everyone, or do they go into each person uniquely? So, just tons of follow up questions from that.\nLenny (44:09):\nFinal question is, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?\nVijay Iyengar (44:14):\nGot a lot of inspiration from Gibson Biddle and his product strategy medium thing. And in particular, there's a piece on proxy metrics and the shape of metrics you should use, which I found is a really... The way he frames it is a really elegant way to measure, reach and impact at the same time of your metrics. And then also a big fan of Shishir from Coda, specifically his essays liaison on [inaudible 00:44:37] questions, framing problems, and the one on marginal churn contribution. It's really interesting.\nLenny (44:42):\nAmazing. Both guests of this podcast and people I love. Great choices. Vijay, this was awesome. Thank you so much for joining me. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more about what you're up to? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\nVijay Iyengar (44:57):\nI'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. I think my handles will be in the show notes. Not super active there, but I definitely check DMs and would love to connect on either of those. And then how can listeners be useful to me? Yeah, I mean, ultimately at Mixpanel, we're building a product for product teams. So, two things. If you haven't used Mixpanel in the last four years, we've changed a lot, as I've described on the pod, so check it out, and happy to take any feedback to help us improve the product.\nLenny (45:23):\nAwesome, Vijay, thank you so much.\nVijay Iyengar (45:26):\nThanks, Lenny. It's been great.\nLenny (45:29):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "Vijay Iyengar (00:00):\n当时我们遇到的问题是，我们把人手从核心产品的投资中抽离出来，去做那些其他事情。我们调走了人手，对吧？所以那里的陷阱是，你在核心业务中为自己留下了被颠覆的可能，因为其他人可以在那个核心上投入更多。因此，如果你是某个核心产品的领导者，我们的经验是，你应该继续在核心产品上投入超过所有其他人，然后将核心产品产生的利润投资到下一个项目中。投资利润而非人手，或者说是风险投资（venture capital），这可能相当于利润的净现值（net present value of profits）或其他类似的东西。但不要把人手从核心业务中抽离出来去做其他事情，因为那样你会变得分心。\n\nLenny (00:40):\n欢迎来到Lenny's Podcast，在这里我采访世界一流的产品负责人和增长专家，帮助你在构建和发展产品的技艺上变得更出色。今天的嘉宾是Vijay Iyengar。Vijay目前是Mixpanel的产品负责人。他实际上有着与我非常相似的职业轨迹，他从亚马逊的工程实习生开始，然后在Uber担任了一段时间的工程师，之后在Mixpanel成为一名工程经理。但后来他从工程经理转变为产品总监，现在是Mixpanel的产品负责人。你很少看到有人从工程领导岗位直接转到产品总监，所以听他从工程经验中学到了什么，并将其带入产品领导方法中，这真的很有趣。但我们大部分时间都在讨论他从Mixpanel的旅程中学到了什么，Mixpanel最初是一个简单的产品，然后扩展到多个不同的产品，为客户解决了许多问题，然后做出了艰难的决定，缩减回只专注于一个核心分析产品。\n\n(01:33):\n我们讨论了他们为什么做出这个选择，他们学到了什么关于何时适合扩展新产品以及何时不应该扩展，以及他们是如何在组织上处理这个问题的。我们还谈到了Mixpanel如何构建产品，他们如何思考产品理念（product philosophy），如何进行优先级排序（prioritize），以及你在为自己的产品设置分析时可能做错了什么。接下来，在我们的精彩赞助商进行简短介绍之后，我将带大家认识Vijay Iyengar。\n\n(01:56):\n本期节目由Pando赞助，Pando是一个持续在线的员工绩效平台。你有多喜欢绩效评估流程？是的，它耗时、主观、存在偏见，而且很少有透明度。随着向分布式工作的快速转变，要创建你想要的结构和透明度来帮助员工在职业生涯中发挥最大影响力并获得成长，这是一项挑战。Pando正在颠覆旧的绩效管理模式，采用一种以员工为中心的持续方法，让员工保持投入，实时看到自己的进步，并确切知道何时以及如何提升。有了Pando，经理可以利用基于能力的框架，有效地指导和发展他们的团队，并统一一致的成长标准，从而获得更高质量的反馈和更高绩效的团队。访问pando.com/lenny了解更多信息，注册并提及本播客可获得特别折扣。网址是pando.com/lenny。\n\n(02:54):\n本期节目由Notion赞助。如果你还没听说过Notion，那你真是out了。我用Notion来协调这个播客，包括我的内容日历、赞助商，以及为每一集发布做嘉宾准备。Notion是一款一体化的团队协作工具，它将笔记、文档共享、维基（wikis）、项目管理以及更多功能整合到一个简单、强大且设计精美的空间中。它不仅能让你在工作中更高效，而且你可以轻松地将其应用于个人生活，这是Notion真正与众不同的另一个特点。前几天，我开始了一个家庭项目，立刻打开Notion来帮助我整理一切。访问notion.com/lennyspod了解更多并免费开始使用。今天就迈出组织有序、快乐团队的第一步，再次提醒是notion.com/lennyspod。Vijay，欢迎来到播客。\n\nVijay Iyengar (03:52):\n谢谢你，Lenny。很高兴来到这里。我是这个播客的忠实粉丝，很高兴能有所贡献。\n\nLenny (03:57):\n我当然想谈谈Mixpanel作为一个产品团队和产品的旅程。但在那之前，作为一名工程师，你长期担任工程师，然后成为了产品负责人，你是否需要“忘却”（unlearn）一些作为工程师时对领导力、产品和业务的看法？\n\nVijay Iyengar (04:13):\n在工程领域待了一段时间后，你会形成一种倾向，对新想法立即回应“不”。我认为从工程角度来看，这是因为你花费大量时间构建和维护那些可能考虑不周或没有真正成功的想法，你完全承受着维护这些想法的成本。所以你会积累“创伤组织”（scar tissue）和这种免疫反应，对新想法说“不”，而且是坚定的“不”，比如“不，我们绝对不会做”。我认为我必须在转向产品后忘掉这一点，因为你会从组织中更多的地方获得大量想法，而想法在形成过程中是脆弱的，一个坚定的“不”可能会扼杀一个你潜在可能走的方向。\n\n(04:55):\n它们可能具有非常高的影响力和覆盖面（high reach and high impact）。所以，我发现一种最好的方法，如果你最终需要说“不”，那就是尝试让它可行。开始尝试让“是”可行，并记录下你是如何尝试让“是”可行的。真诚地去做，而不是仅仅把它当作一个你正在考虑的替代方案。真诚地尝试，在努力让“是”可行之后再得到“不”。所以，这就是我一直在尝试的，运用我的工程师解决问题的思维来做这件事，而不是去思考它可能行不通的地方，然后说“不”。\n\nLenny (05:25):\n你是否建议工程师们回顾一下并在这方面努力？我知道作为一名产品经理，我喜欢工程师说“是”，这太棒了。我实际上会帮助每个人学会说“是”。但作为一名工程师，这通常是一个挑战。你对那些目前是工程师，也许想在这方面改进或改变他们对新事物说“是”或“不”的方式的人有什么建议？\n\nVijay Iyengar (05:48):\n我认为我合作过的一些最优秀的工程师实际上已经这样做了，但[听不清 00:05:53]他们能够在大脑中同时平衡这两者。所以，最终这种平衡行为，你刚刚值完班，凌晨3点被各种糟糕的想法吵醒了三次，第二天早上醒来，站起来，然后有人说：“嘿，我们能做这个新事情吗？”你多少必须要有那种同理心，并做到这一点。所以，是的，我认为这个练习就是花10分钟考虑这个想法，并真诚地考虑我们如何才能让它奏效。如果在10分钟结束时，它仍然是徒劳的，没有可行的路径，那么说“不”也没关系。在很多情况下，说“不”是一种很好的直觉。但是，是的，我会向工程师推荐这一点。我想如果我早点学会，我的职业生涯肯定会更好。\n\nLenny (06:26):\n我想花点时间谈谈Mixpanel的产品历程。这是一个有趣的过山车。我想这家公司成立多久了？2010年？2009年？\n\nVijay Iyengar (06:34):\n2009年，是的。\n\nLenny (06:35):\n我知道它最初是一个非常简单的产品分析产品。然后，就像所有有抱负的公司一样，你们寻找更多的问题来解决。你们寻找更多客户的问题。据我所知，你们在Mixpanel的产品套件中增加了更多产品。然后我知道在扩展方面遇到了一些挑战，也许这些产品并没有像你们希望的那样受欢迎。据我了解，最近你们又回到了只专注于一个核心分析产品。所以我想听听这个过程是怎样的，作为产品负责人和一家公司，你们从扩展、尝试解决许多问题，然后回到一个核心简单问题中学到了什么？\n\nVijay Iyengar (07:15):\nMixpanel于2009年成立，旨在为EPD团队提供产品分析。我认为早期它取得了很大的成功，因为它构建了一个内部数据库，名为Arb，代表任意细分（arbitrary segmentation）。这在当时是必要的，因为事件数据（event data），也就是产品分析的燃料，比大多数其他类型的数据要大几个数量级，所以你需要一种专门的方法来处理它。我认为这激发了第一波爆发式增长，因为产品分析在当时是一个非常紧迫的问题。人们疯狂地发布移动应用程序，他们需要一个能够扩展的解决方案，这在一段时间内是Mixpanel持久的护城河（durable mode）。我认为，由于我们的SDK安装在如此多的应用程序中，我们拥有高度可扩展的事件收集和分析界面，自然而然地就扩展到了几个邻近领域，这些领域可以利用相同的技术。\n\n(08:04):\n第一个是消息传递，能够向用户发送有针对性的消息，这是一件很自然的事情，你可能想做，特别是如果你已经安装了SDK。是的。我们添加的另一个方面是数据基础设施（data infrastructure），并试图成为公司数据单一事实来源（single source of truth）。最终发生的是，到2018年，我们遇到了一个很大的流失问题。我们的核心产品有大约40%的收入流失（revenue churn）。当我们深入调查时，并不是因为人们不再需要产品分析而流失。他们有这个需求。他们只是流失到竞争对手那里，因为我们在核心产品的功能方面无法满足市场需求。当我们深入了解原因时，发现我们的工程团队有50%的人员分布在三个领域，产品分析、消息传递和数据工程方面。\n\n(08:52):\n我们的工程团队人手太少，无法解决所有这些核心功能上的差距。所以我们当时做了一个非常艰难的决定。我们对其他两个类别说“不”，并决定将整个工程团队集中在弥补产品分析的差距并在那里进行创新。从流程角度来看，我们如何操作这一点是，我们抛弃了我们迄今为止计划进行的所有规划、执行和工作，我们做了一些非常简单的事情。我们收集了我们的客户成功和销售团队多年来辛辛苦苦收集的所有流失原因，按类别分组，大致就是我们需要构建的产品功能，然后按ARR（Annual Recurring Revenue，年度经常性收入）降序排列，取出前10项，将其作为我们的路线图，让每位工程师直接接触客户，并给他们一个去做工作的桶，这我认为与现有的数百万产品最佳实践背道而驰。\n\n(09:41):\n但我认为，考虑到当时的情况，我们需要优化速度，而速度来自于你对想做什么和重点有极端的清晰度。所以我们在那时真的只是优化了速度。所以在第一年，我们行动非常迅速，在那一年发布了大约一百个功能，弥补了许多差距。再说一次，这些都是虚荣指标。衡量功能数量没有任何意义。\n\nLenny (10:04):\n顺便问一下，这是哪一年？\n\nVijay Iyengar (10:06):\n这是2018年到2019年。\n\nLenny (10:09):\n明白了。\n\nVijay Iyengar (10:09):\n是的。所以我们非常快地发布了所有这些功能，并立即看到了胜率（win rate）和留存率（retention）的提升。但开始出现的一个裂缝是，我们当时忽略了产品的整体设计，对吧？如果你以如此快的速度发布功能，你没有时间停下来思考，这应该放在哪里，以及它如何融入我们的整体系统架构？开始发生的是，我们对其中一些功能的回报递减（diminishing returns）。不考虑整体设计和一致性意味着每个功能的覆盖面都很低。我们必须为我们产品中的每个部分重新构建它。所以当时我们做出了……我们启动了第二个流（stream），这个流是设计主导的。我认为这也恰逢我们采用Figma的时候，它在公司中拥有非常广泛的设计话语权（seat at the table），我们只是设定了一个目标，让设计成为我们关键的差异化因素之一。\n\n(10:53):\n所以这个设计驱动的倡议实际上是关于我们如何思考我们产品的系统架构？Mixpanel的关键构建模块是什么？它们需要放在哪里？我们可以有多少个（这是一个非常重要的步骤）？然后用户将如何发现它们以及它们之间如何关联？但我认为这种认识源于这样一个事实，即许多优秀的产品成败取决于它们的架构。例如，我认为Notion的页面和区块架构非常强大，你可以在这些核心构建模块上挂载如此多的功能，以至于对这些功能的覆盖面和发现性产生了如此高的影响。\n\n(11:26):\n所以，无论如何，我们与……并行地做到了这一点，并继续在核心任务上努力。所以那个阶段，从2018年到大约2021年末、2022年，结果是我们的留存率（retention）从大约60%上升到90%，我们的NPS（Net Promoter Score，净推荐值）从16分上升到50分。所以我想，是的，这里有很多值得探讨的地方，但重新聚焦于核心确实帮助我们取得了这些成果。\n\nLenny (11:52):\n明白了。是的。我有很多关于这个的问题。太有趣了。那么，你经历的那个阶段，你们按潜在ARR（年度经常性收入）排序事物，那是在扩展到多个产品的阶段，还是在决定专注于分析并全力以赴之后？\n\nVijay Iyengar (12:06):\n哦，那是在专注于分析之后。\n\nLenny (12:08):\n好的。\n\nVijay Iyengar (12:08):\n是的。是的。\n\nLenny (12:09):\n你是说，你们有一条线是专门用来构建所有缺失的、导致客户流失的功能，同时还有一条线是用来构建这个产品，以便它能够很好地连接和协同工作，并且经过深思熟虑的长期规划？\n\nVijay Iyengar (12:24):\n第一件事，我可能说得好像那些只是功能。我们确实采取了将它们转化为问题并明确地将工程师直接暴露给遇到这些问题的客户的步骤，然后设计出解决这些问题的方案。所以我的意思是，粗略地说，这其中涉及一些功能，但很多都是我们需要解决的核心问题。\n\nLenny (12:40):\n第一个方法太有趣了。这有点像，是的，如果我们专注于这些功能，我们会赚更多的钱。正如你所说，结果只是一堆可能没有协同作用的功能和产品。回顾过去，至少在一段时间内，以这种方式处理是个好主意吗？\n\nVijay Iyengar (12:54):\n这很大程度上取决于你的具体情况。在竞争非常激烈的环境中，客户需要一些基本功能（table stakes features），并且市场已经验证了这些功能，那么你需要优先考虑速度，而不是其他任何事情。但这种方法很快就会失去其效用，我们在那个阶段之后相对迅速地抛弃了这种方法。我实际上会说，设计驱动阶段是下一个阶段，当时的情况是，好吧，我们不再在基本功能上失血了，但我们想制作一个具有高覆盖面、高影响力的全面产品，并且确实可用。所以我认为这是一个必要的后续阶段。显然，根据你的具体情况和竞争动态，你可以以不同的方式安排它们的顺序，但我认为做出这个决定是正确的……这有点像值班的情况，当你遇到麻烦时，你必须摆脱麻烦。你的房子着火了，你不能去修剪草坪。你必须先扑灭火，然后处理其他一切。\n\nLenny (13:47):\n是的。\n\nVijay Iyengar (13:47):\n所以这就是我们采取的方法。\n\nLenny (13:49):\n你能举一个在第一个阶段发布的功能或产品的例子吗？然后，如果能想到的话，再举一个设计主导方法带来的例子。\n\nVijay Iyengar (14:00):\n我想在第一个阶段，天哪，有很多核心功能。我们当时没有一个好的用户群（cohorts）产品，无法创建行为用户群（behavioral cohorts），也无法从我们构建的任何报告中创建它们，对吧？我认为这只是分析中的基本功能。所以，这是我们构建的第一批东西之一，而且相当明显。还有很多其他更高级的漏斗分析（funnel analytics）、流程（flows）和交互式可视化（interactive visualization）。我认为在设计主导阶段，最大的亮点是可视化的一致性，并使我们的图表在整个产品中以一致的方式进行交互。这实现了两件事。第一是，每当我们添加新的可视化或对可视化进行新的增强，或者在某个报告中进行排序时，它都会立即应用到所有地方。\n\n(14:46):\n所以，我们添加的所有内容的覆盖面都增加了。第二点是，它让产品更容易访问，让我们能够添加深色模式（dark mode）。这让我们的可视化效果非常惊艳，并且非常容易看到其核心要点。然后，我们添加的每一个新可视化都继承了所有这些优点。\n\nLenny (14:59):\n我正在试着想象一家公司经历这个阶段，即“嘿，我们只是要构建一堆我们知道我们需要的东西。”听起来像是，“哦，是的，然后我们只需让它们看起来都很棒，并连接起来，运行良好。”我想这并非计划好的，我想让人们放慢构建更多产品和功能的速度，或者将其推向一个使其都合理的方向，这并非易事。你能谈谈这个过程是怎样的吗？从“我们只需完成所有待办事项”到“让我们放慢脚步，花大量时间进行设计”的转变有多难？\n\nVijay Iyengar (15:35):\n它在内部肯定比我描述的要混乱得多。一个关键的转折点是，我们拥有一个非常有才华的设计团队，但我们让他们从事这些非常战术性的项目，坦率地说，这些项目是由工程主导的，对吧？设计团队通常在项目末期才被要求加入，并被问到：“嘿，你能让它看起来漂亮一点，并添加一些像素吗？”让你的设计团队做这些事情简直是浪费。但与此同时，节奏又如此之快，他们没有时间停下来做其他事情。所以实际上有这样一个时刻，我当时是其中的一名工程经理。\n\n(16:05):\n当时我和我们的BM以及设计主管开会，我们说：“嘿，我们实际上可以在没有任何设计的情况下完成接下来的三个月的项目，”这是一种颇具争议的说法，“但我们这样做是为了让你们可以与一组设计师花三个月的时间去思考产品的系统架构，我们会在完成之后再进行任何可能影响架构的架构性工作。”我认为这给了设计师一些喘息的空间去做这件事，让他们暂时脱离战术性的“火灾”。因为之前的情况是，我们会在项目快结束时引入设计团队，他们会利用每个项目机会来“挤”进去，比如“哦，我们可以在这里简化一下。”而这正是在项目末期扩大范围的典型方式，因为当时没有为设计主导的项目留出专门的空间。\n\n(16:48):\n我认为这曾是一个关键的摩擦点，我们最终不得不暂时将其分离，然后重新组合并说：“好吧，现在我们来看看我们的策略是什么？”然后仅仅为了改善我们用户体验的一致性、覆盖面和深度而开展项目。\n\nLenny (17:02):\n回顾过去，你们通过添加一系列产品来解决更多客户问题的过程，是每个创始人（founder）和产品团队都在思考的问题：我们什么时候应该增加新的产品线？我们什么时候应该超越核心业务进行扩展？我很好奇你从中吸取了什么教训，以及你会给其他创始人（founder）和公司什么建议，关于什么时候是扩展并考虑新产品、第三个产品和第四个产品的时机？\n\nVijay Iyengar (17:28):\n我不知道这里是否有硬性规定。我只能说在我们当时的环境下，什么是有意义的，什么是没有意义的。我们当时的问题是，我们把人手从核心产品的投资中抽离出来，去做那些其他事情。我们调走了人手，对吧？所以那里的陷阱是，你在核心业务中为自己留下了被颠覆的可能，因为其他人可以在那个核心上投入更多。因此，如果你是某个核心产品的领导者，我们的经验是，你应该继续在核心产品上投入超过所有其他人，然后将核心产品产生的利润投资到下一个项目中。投资利润而非人手，或者说是风险投资（venture capital），这可能相当于利润的净现值（net present value of profits）或其他类似的东西。但不要把人手从核心业务中抽离出来去做其他事情，因为那样你会变得分心。\n\n(18:10):\n另一方面，我们承担的那些次要产品（secondary products）都有各自的类别。这真的很诱人，你经常会不经意间进入另一个类别，然后你最终会构建出这些“附加”（bolt-on）产品，它们在自己的类别中并不是最好的。分析的邻近类别有CDP（Customer Data Platform，客户数据平台）或消息定位（message targeting）或功能切换（feature flagging）等，但很少有人需要第六好的CDP，第八好的功能切换，或第十好的消息定位工具。最终结果是，这些产品总共只贡献你收入的5%到10%，不会严重加速你的增长率，反而会把工程师从核心产品中抽走。所以，当时我们所处的情况就是这样。\n\n(18:50):\n我认为，如果你看到核心产品有客户流失到竞争对手那里，而你又不是任何其他产品中的佼佼者，那么也许是时候重新评估了。我要说的最后一点是，削减“温和的成功”（mild successes）比其他任何事情都要痛苦十倍，而且组织上也很痛苦。有些团队有完整的路线图，这是一个非常痛苦的经历，所以你在启动这些项目之前必须非常仔细地考虑。\n\nLenny (19:18):\n这真是非常非常富有洞察力的建议，让我想到了，如果你捆绑提供“足够好”（good enough）的解决方案，那么需要有一个“核心支柱”（anchored tenant），即我绝不会放弃这个东西，我宁愿使用其他东西的第三好版本，如果你有的话。但如果你没有那么有价值和重要，你就不会说服人们使用某个东西，因为他们正在与每个类别中最好的产品竞争。\n\nVijay Iyengar (19:39):\n没错。是的。\n\nLenny (19:40):\n这真的很有趣。我一直在做关于不同公司如何构建产品系列的节目，我有一些问题想问，关于Mixpanel的产品开发流程。\n\nVijay Iyengar (19:50):\n当然。\n\nLenny (19:51):\n首先是，你们如何规划？你们如何规划？我知道它会演变，但你们目前是如何规划的？你们的规划周期多长？你们提前多久进行详细规划？你们使用OKR（Objectives and Key Results，目标与关键成果）吗？我们从这三个子问题开始吧。\n\nVijay Iyengar (20:04):\n我们正在解决分析领域中尚未解决的问题。对我们来说，这意味着人们总是想要更强大的功能、更高的简洁性、更好的数据信任、更快的入职流程、更好的协作以及更好的性价比。因此，我们主要围绕这些问题和使命来组织我们的团队。这里有一个小插曲，其中一些问题相互之间存在张力。强大的功能和简洁性之间存在权衡，对吧？我们希望一个团队同时拥有这两者，这样他们就被迫面对这种张力并克服这种权衡。所以，这就是我们对产品团队的总体思考方式，即这些跨职能的EPD团队，每个团队都专注于为客户解决这些长期存在的、相互关联的问题[听不清 00:20:41]，我们的核心分析团队专注于强大的功能、简洁性、权衡问题。在规划方面，我们的规划周期是六个月。我实际上可以谈谈我们最近的规划周期，因为我们刚刚完成它。\n\nLenny (20:53):\n是的，我们来谈谈。\n\nVijay Iyengar (20:54):\n是的，它基本上始于我们领导团队撰写的一份战略备忘录（strategy memo），该备忘录基本传达了我们公司在未来一年希望去往何方，以及产品团队如何最大程度地为此做出贡献，并确立了这些关键支柱。我们与团队分享了这份备忘录，他们收到后，结合他们不断获取的关于所处理问题和客户的定量和定性信息，构思并制定了接下来六个月的一系列“赌注”（bets），我认为这在某种程度上类似于OKR，其中一个“赌注”的结构是：我们想要解决的问题、我们对解决方案的假设，然后是一些获胜计划，一些实际实现目标的计划，以及衡量是否实现目标的方法。\n\n(21:32):\n我认为我们与进行规划的其他公司相比，做了一件独特的事情……我认为通常是这样一个“W”形流程：先有战略备忘录，然后团队提出“赌注”，接着进行审查，然后他们回去迭代，最后确定。而我们则压缩了“W”形流程的中间部分，我和我们的设计主管实际上与每个团队一起构思这些“赌注”，并参与到解决方案发现过程中，参与到“头脑风暴”（jam sessions）中，甚至自己用Figma添加想法和思考。我们之所以这样做，是因为我们不是一个庞大的产品团队，我们不会在一个半月内完成50件事。我们可能只会做10到12件事。\n\n(22:12):\n因此，这足以让我们做一些不具扩展性的事情，如果这能使我们与团队之间进行高带宽沟通的话。在这个阶段，它最终会变得更加混乱和非结构化，因为我们也在其中贡献想法。但到最后，我认为团队离开时会感到对他们的“赌注”更有信心，因为投入了更多的思考，并且在自上而下地理解为什么做出某些决定方面更加一致。所以，我认为这是一个不同之处。然后，我们通过向公司其他部门展示路线图来结束这个过程，并获得他们的反馈。\n\nLenny (22:41):\n这个过程通常需要多长时间？\n\nVijay Iyengar (22:43):\n团队在12月进行了几周的准备工作，大约两周。然后在1月的前两周，我们进行了为期两周的解决方案制定和构思的“冲刺”（sprint）。\n\nLenny (22:53):\n太棒了。每个团队的规划结果是什么？他们是否提供一份文档，说明“这是我们的战略，这是我们的重大赌注，这是路线图”？你们是否有一个模板可以传阅？你们如何得到一个人们可以分享、展示和评论的东西？\n\nVijay Iyengar (23:10):\n是的，我认为基本上有三种相互关联的“产物”（artifacts）。首先，我们使用Notion，所以我们在Notion中有一个名为“赌注”（bets）的数据库，其中数据库的每一页都是[听不清 00:23:22]。它有一个模板，是的。所以它大致就是我所描述的，还有一些额外的部分，比如我们正在解决什么问题？有什么需求证据？这个问题的影响范围有多大？我们如何知道我们成功了？以及解决方案背后的关键驱动假设是什么？然后是一个粗略的路线图。这与一个演示文稿相关联，这个演示文稿是所有内容的精简摘要，每个“赌注”有一张幻灯片。它还与一个更注重执行的计划相关联，即我们如何安排和分配人员，并消除依赖项，这部分由工程团队贡献。所以，我认为这三者是相互关联的“产物”。\n\nLenny

(25:17):\n一个非常常见的优先级排序框架是RICE，即覆盖面（Reach）、影响（Impact）、信心（Confidence）、投入（Effort）。我认为它简单且相当稳健，这通常是框架的好品质。但我们观察到RICE的一个陷阱是，C（信心）和E（投入）往往会导致你过早地将潜在的高覆盖面、高影响力的“赌注”（bets），那些真正创新的东西，降级。去年年初，我们一个团队就遇到了这种情况，我们对所有想法都进行了RICE评估，结果许多高覆盖面、高影响力的东西都排到了最后，因为它们的信心和投入度都非常模糊，这对于高覆盖面、高影响力的想法来说是正常的。\n\n(25:55):\n所以我们敦促我们的团队进行的一个练习是，比平时更长时间地忽略C和E，只是和那些高覆盖面、高影响力的想法一起讨论，让工程师和设计师在场，承诺实际尝试解决它们。给它一个公平的机会。你通常会发现，如果你花一周时间研究这些想法，你可以在理解信心和投入方面取得很大的进展。你可能会找到一种更高信心、更低投入的方式来完成它们。然后将C和E加回去，像往常一样进行RICE评估。目标是最终得到创新“赌注”、增量“赌注”以及需要解决的技术债（technical debt）或产品债（product debt）的合理组合。\n\nLenny (26:31):\n我通常会把C自己去掉。我发现它并没有那么强大。你是在Google Sheet里做这个吗？你是在Notion里用这个吗？你实际上建议团队如何进行这个优先级排序，还是只是凭直觉？\n\nVijay Iyengar (26:43):\n我对团队使用的具体工具并没有特别的看法。我认为这通常是一个团队内部的练习，但大多数团队都使用Notion，并且在Notion中使用简单的表格或数据库——\n\nLenny (26:51):\n太棒了。\n\nVijay Iyengar (26:52):\n……运作良好。我认为优先级排序方面另一个总是很棘手的问题是估算。每个工程师都会说，你的估算都是谎言，如果你说需要八周，那就会需要八个月。但我认为估算的核心问题是，你被要求在事情是什么之前就进行估算，这简直是一个奇怪的期望产出。我发现一个非常有趣的方法来自Basecamp的《Shape Up》这本书，它提出了“胃口而非估算”（appetite over estimates）的想法，不是将估算作为规划的产出，而是将时间盒（time box）或胃口作为输入，你说：“我们想解决X问题，我们愿意投入六周时间来解决这个问题。”\n\n(27:31):\n这里显而易见的问题是如何选择那个时间窗口？它看起来很随意。所以Basecamp的人建议对所有事情都选择六周，他们对如果你不能将范围（scope）限制到六周内，那就是你做错了这一点非常严格，我认为……这可以奏效，并且如果它能在公司内部创造一种节奏，就会带来很多好处，但我发现一种更好的方法是选择一个听起来合理的“胃口”，然后探索其周围的两到三个选项。选择六周，然后说：“如果我们只有四周或八周，我们会怎么做？”你就会自然地找到成本和影响的有效边界，然后达成一致。重要的是，在这个时间段结束后，你要进行检查，说：“是否有任何新的信息表明我们应该继续？我们是否发现了最大的风险？我们是否只是在做一些边际的事情？”并且对自己诚实。我认为无论你使用什么框架，这一点都很重要。\n\nLenny (28:23):\n我真的很喜欢这个。那么，你们实际上就是这样操作的吗？你们设定一个时间盒，例如这个项目有四周时间，我们完成什么就发布什么，没完成的就推迟？\n\nVijay Iyengar (28:30):\n我们在工程方面就是这样操作的，特别是在基础设施方面，因为我们有一系列项目总是需要很长时间，而且时间越长，需要的时间就越长。所以我们做了很多这样的练习。我想说更多的是在工程量大的项目上，而不是其他项目，但我们也在产品方面开始更多地采用它。我们在产品方面主要采取的练习是更多地考虑，使用不同的时间盒方法，你会如何做不同的事情？\n\nLenny (28:56):\n只是一个思想实验。\n\nVijay Iyengar (28:58):\n是的，这是一个很好的思想实验。然后它只是迫使每个人真正地对需求进行评分。关键的、可有可无的，这很好，但如果两周后，你将被拉去完成完全不同的事情，那么一个能解决核心问题的完整解决方案会是什么样子。它迫使你首先剥离问题的核心，而不是只做围绕它的事情。\n\nLenny (29:17):\n那很酷。我真的很喜欢那个。我自己也做过。我很好奇是否有人真的遵循“Shape Up”（来自Basecamp的一本书，关于产品开发方法）流程，或者只是说我们将在六周内发布所有准备好的东西，而不是有具体的截止日期或具体的发布产品目标？\n\nVijay Iyengar (29:32):\n是的。我认为“Shape Up”流程，如果你一直贯彻下去。他们的想法是，你实际上可以在六周的时间范围内进行预测。所以你可以将范围（scope）限制到完全完成的东西。它必须是完整的。它不能是六周内半生不熟的里程碑一，我认为这种严谨性……他们对它的全面应用，你需要彻底地做。你不能半途而废地采用这个流程。我想这就是挑战。否则你最终会看到人们发布里程碑一然后继续前进，这不是一个完整的产品。\n\nLenny (30:01):\n有道理。关于你们如何构建产品，还有几个问题。你提到你们在保持产品团队与客户紧密联系方面有独特的方法。我很好奇你从中学到了什么，你发现什么有助于保持产品团队与客户的紧密联系。\n\nVijay Iyengar (30:15):\n我认为这是Mixpanel很早就在投资的一件事。实际上大约在2018年，当我们重新专注于核心产品时，我们的一位销售工程师Aaron构建了一个自动化系统，他将所有我们从客户那里获得的、由我们的客户成功和销售团队报告的客户需求（customer gaps）导入Slack，形成一个信息流。这创造了一种文化，所有工程师和设计师都可以直接获取未经筛选的原始客户痛点信息，没有任何看门人，无需通过任何流程即可访问，也无需预先聚合。我认为这在很大程度上是可扩展的。对于我们这种规模的产品团队和客户覆盖范围，我们收到的反馈量不会多到一个人每天20分钟读不完。在工程部门的四年或五年里，我每天都会阅读我们收到的所有客户痛点，许多工程师也会这样做。\n\n(31:04):\n由此形成的一种惯例是，我们发现工程师会进入那个频道，用一个带有邮件表情符号的消息进行回应，这意味着“我要给这位客户发邮件，了解更多”，对吧？他们会直接给客户发邮件说：“嘿，我是构建这个功能的工程师。我看到你提到了这个具体的问题。你能告诉我更多吗？我很想了解。”他们会问五个“为什么”（five why's），然后他们会自己改进产品。我认为这种文化非常重要，它赋予了所有工程师和设计师一点产品经理的思维，我认为这减轻了产品经理作为所有信息守门人的负担。\n\n(31:39):\n随着时间的推移，我们根据数据堆栈（data stack）的发展，对其进行了很大的演进。所以我们现在不仅接收客户请求，我们还会接收发布在Twitter上的内容、NPS（Net Promoter Score，净推荐值）调查反馈以及来自竞争交易的赢失笔记，并将它们同时导入Slack和Notion，这样我们既能获得实时信息流，又能对内容进行排序、聚合和标记。但这个过程的关键在于它是完全开放的，没有任何守门人。\n\nLenny (32:04):\n那听起来既神奇又疯狂。你们仍然允许工程师直接给客户发邮件，问他们关于这些事情的问题吗？还是随着公司的发展，这变得更难了？\n\nVijay Iyengar (32:12):\n哦不，我们仍然允许那样做。是的。\n\nLenny (32:14):\n哇，那太棒了。\n\nVijay Iyengar (32:15):\n这个技术栈（stack）的一个好处是，实际上，所有这些信息流都汇集到我们的数据仓库（data warehouse），也就是BigQuery。然后，通过我们使用的逆向ETL（reverse ETL）工具Census，它们被推送到Slack和Notion，实现无代码操作。但这其中一个好处是，我们可以用账户信息（who's the account?）、年度经常性收入（ARR）以及客户成功经理（CSM）等所有其他联系信息来丰富所有这些信息流。所以工程师通常不会在没有告知CSM的情况下盲目联系客户，特别是如果那是价值数百万美元的账户。我们的理念是信任他们掌握这些信息，他们可以标记正确的人，并做出正确的判断。\n\nLenny (32:50):\n我很好奇这会如何进行优先级排序，以及产品经理是如何参与其中的，但我们不必深入探讨。这是一个非常酷的流程。我以前从未见过。我们的工程师直接给客户发邮件，深入挖掘问题。\n\nVijay Iyengar (33:01):\n当然，陷阱就是你刚才指出的，你不能对所有事情都随时做出反应。当然，如果你发布了一个重新设计，前两周你会收到一堆反馈，比如“我讨厌这个。回到以前的样子。”我认为这是一种组织肌肉，你必须建立起来，平衡反应，这只是我们必须练习做的事情，但我认为这些权衡是值得的。\n\nLenny (33:20):\n太棒了。沿着这些思路，最后一个问题，你能谈谈你们使用的工具，你们用于产品团队协作、沟通、笔记、文档的SaaS产品吗？你提到了Notion作为一个例子。\n\nVijay Iyengar (33:31):\n我认为我们目前的技术栈实际上相当标准。我们使用Slack、Zoom进行沟通，Notion用于文档和任何长篇写作，它是一个[听不清 00:33:42]数据库，以及Figma和FigJam用于设计和白板。我认为实际上更有趣的是我们的数据栈以及我们从中获得的生产力。我之前简单提过，基本上我们所有系统中的所有数据都通过ETL（Extract, Transform, Load，提取、转换、加载）导入BigQuery，进行连接和建模，然后通过Census推送到我们技术栈中的所有其他工具。我认为这是一个巨大的生产力突破，因为你可以用很少的代码构建内部工具。如果你会写SQL，你基本上就可以构建一个内部工具，将信息推送到需要它的团队。所以，我认为这解锁了许多这类事情，比如以可靠的无代码方式自动化定性信号。\n\n(34:22):\n然后如果有人说：“哦，我能得到这个的ARR吗？”是的，当然，这只需要两秒钟。所以，我认为那个数据栈对我们来说是一个巨大的生产力突破。\n\nLenny (34:29):\n太棒了。你们有没有在网上分享过，展示你们构建的技术栈？\n\nVijay Iyengar (34:33):\n我们有几篇博客文章讨论了我们用于…我们同时用于产品主导增长（PLG）基础设施和产品的技术栈，比如定义一个合格产品用户（PQL）并提醒符合该标准的新用户，但我们也将其用于内部工具。我们有几篇关于这个主题的博客文章。\n\nLenny (34:48):\n太好了。我们会跟进，并在节目说明中包含一些内容。\n\nVijay Iyengar (34:51):\n是的，当然。\n\nLenny (34:53):\n最后一个问题，你是Mixpanel产品负责人，是产品分析领域世界上最聪明的人之一。我很好奇，你认为大多数人在为他们的网站、产品或公司设置产品分析时，最常犯的错误是什么？\n\nVijay Iyengar (35:08):\n这可能有点“热门话题”（hot take），因为我认为很多人——\n\nLenny (35:11):\n来了。\n\nVijay Iyengar (35:12):\n是的，很多人仍然这样做，但我认为最大的错误是使用客户端SDK（client-side SDKs）进行分析设置，也就是客户端追踪（client-side tracking）。比如在你的网页应用或移动应用中放置一个mixpanel.track或segment.track。之所以说这是一个“热门话题”，是因为对许多人来说，产品分析和SDK追踪是同义词。他们会说：“Mixpanel就是SDK，我必须在我的网页和移动应用中放置一个SDK。”但这是一个错误，因为我们一次又一次地看到，它会导致数据质量差，并且难以维护这些数据。所以，在网页上，仅仅由于广告拦截器（app blockers）和其他不可靠的东西，在JavaScript世界中，你最终会丢失20%到30%的事件，所以它与你的内部数据库不匹配。\n\n(35:55):\n而在移动端，存在两个问题。首先，你必须为iOS和Android重新设计追踪，因为它们是两种不同的语言和两种不同的平台，通常来说。因此，你最终会得到许多语义相同但由于平台不同而不同的重复事件，而且你可能有两个团队负责这些。第二个问题，我认为更糟，是你有点受制于客户端更新他们的移动应用以获取包含你最新追踪的最新版本。所以如果你想添加新的追踪，它只适用于最新版本及以后的用户。而你所有旧的追踪，无论是损坏的还是你犯了错误的，仍然存在于野外，所以你会不断收到旧的、损坏的事件。\n\n(36:32):\n所以我们推荐的，以及我们最近看到越来越多客户采用的方法是，从你的服务器而不是客户端追踪事件。这有三个好处。第一，它立即实现了跨平台。网页、移动、电视和任何其他平台，它们都会通过你的服务器，所以你立即获得了100%的覆盖。第二，它在一个你控制的环境中。所以如果你想更新追踪，你可以更新它，并且它对100%的用户都适用。第三，这可能有点违反直觉，但它是真的，工程师们一直在从服务器追踪事件，这叫做日志（logs），对吧？事件就是带有用户ID（user ID）的日志。所以他们不需要处理学习新的SDK和所有这些事情。他们只需要追踪一些有结构和用户ID的日志。他们正在追踪事件。\n\n(37:18):\n因此，如果对开发人员来说更容易，那么它就会以更高质量的方式完成。所以，我认为那里非常简单的建议就是开始从你的服务器而不是从你的客户端追踪事件。如果你以后需要补充只有客户端才有的上下文，你可以稍后添加，但服务器端应该是默认设置。\n\nLenny (37:34):\n也许最后一个问题是，在过去几年中，公司使用分析的方式发生了哪些最大变化？以及你认为分析领域将走向何方？\n\nVijay Iyengar (37:43):\n是的，我认为一个巨大的趋势是数据仓库（data warehouse）的兴起。它们是Snowflake、BigQuery、Redshift，它们具有高度可扩展性，并使用SQL标准，这导致了围绕它们涌现出大量工具，使得将数据加载到数据仓库变得非常容易和便宜，同时也可以通过工具轻松地将数据从数据仓库中推出。这有几个含义。首先，数据仓库成为公司所有数据的重心。无论是产品、营销还是销售数据，它们都汇集在那里。我认为这在当今以产品主导增长（product led growth）的世界中非常有价值，而且很多时候我的表达不好。但从数据角度来看，这意味着所有这些团队都需要基于同一个“事实真相”（same version of the truth）来运作，而这个“事实真相”就存在于数据仓库中，只需要正确地连接起来。\n\n(38:33):\n第二件事，关于未来走向，是事件——用户在某个时间点执行某个操作的时间序列——是分析的通用数据模型。原因在于，客户的每一次行动，每一次交互，无论是与你的销售团队（比如一次Gong电话），还是与你的营销团队（他们点击了某个营销文章或查看了），还是与你的产品（这更广为人知），所有这些都是事件。它们都可以被建模为事件。而且它具有超强的粒度，作为理解人们正在做什么的方式，它非常直观。而且它非常强大，因为你经常想问关于事件序列的问题，对吧？哪个用户在我的定价页面上花费了这么多时间，然后查看了三篇开发者文档？这可能是我想要联系的用户。很多事情都可以基于此进行建模。\n\n(39:17):\n所以我认为数据仓库正在成为所有这些数据的“装载码头”（loading dock），这些数据可以很容易地被建模为事件，但它并不是一个很好的事件分析工具，因为SQL是为行、表和连接（rows and tables and joints）优化的，而不是为事件、事件序列和事件的细分（segmentations of events）优化的。所以我们正在花费大量时间思考的一件事是，我们如何将那些真正丰富、可信、全面的数据集从数据仓库导入到一款从UI到数据模型都为事件优化的工具中，因为它能解锁对人们已经拥有和信任的数据集进行快速直观的探索？所以，我认为这是我们感到兴奋的一大趋势，也是我们所看到的未来。\n\nLenny (39:56):\n有趣。你认为Mixpanel在帮助人们实现这一点方面处于有利地位吗？你认为这是你们这样的公司会帮助人们解决的问题，还是每个人都必须自己解决，或者说会有一整批新的初创公司涌现来帮助他们整理数据仓库的混乱？\n\nVijay Iyengar (40:11):\n不，总会有新的初创公司加入分析领域。从未有沉闷时刻。是的，我认为这是我们正在努力解决的问题，因为我的意思是，分析的质量取决于数据。如果人们已经在仓库中收集了高质量的数据，我的意思是，我们与仓库集成得非常好，那么我们就能访问那些高质量的数据。我们越来越多地看到，像Census和Hightouch这样的公司在逆向ETL（reverse ETL）阶段，实际上正在重新发明CDP（Customer Data Platform，客户数据平台），重新发明像Segment这样的数据移动工具，这些工具是建立在数据仓库之上的。所以我们在这方面的策略就是加强与这些工具的集成。我们已经看到了巨大的增长，人们正在使用他们的数据仓库作为事件的来源，而不是在任何地方添加SDK追踪，只是说：“我这里已经有事件了。我信任所有这些事件。它们来自我业务的各个部分。为什么我不能像分析用户行为一样，轻松地分析我的支持工单和Gong电话？”所以我认为这是我们正在看到并投资的趋势。\n\nLenny (41:04):\n太棒了。在我们进行非常激动人心的闪电问答环节之前，还有什么想分享的吗？\n\nVijay Iyengar (41:09):\n是的，我们一开始谈到了从工程到产品的转型，我认为在我的职业生涯中，无论是在工程方面还是产品方面，都非常有成效的一件事就是采纳产品思维，更贴近客户，获取原始的客户背景信息，抓住每一个与他们交谈的机会。我很高兴看到像这个播客、你的新闻通讯以及其他平台，让工程师也能培养产品思维，更贴近客户，因为我认为从长远来看，这意味着以更低的价格提供更好的产品和服务，这就是创新。所以我真的很期待看到世界上更多这样的事情。\n\nLenny (41:45):\n正是如此！至此，我们进入了非常非常激动人心的闪电问答环节。我有六个快速问题要问你。我将很快地问过去。想到什么就分享什么，我们看看会怎么样。好吗？\n\nVijay Iyengar (41:57):\n当然。开始吧。\n\nLenny (41:58):\n好的。你最推荐给别人的两本书是什么？\n\nVijay Iyengar (42:02):\n就商业书籍而言，有一本书叫《目标》（The Goal），作者是以利雅胡·戈德拉特（Eliyahu Goldratt）。这是一本老书了，但我喜欢它，因为它以这种快节奏的惊悚小说模式写成。它像一本小说，但它讲述的是约束理论（theory of constraints）的思想，即在一个系统中发现约束，以及如何消除它们以提高生产力。所以我发现它既有趣，也很有启发性。我还向人们推荐非技术类书籍，特别是住在旧金山的人，那就是加里·卡米亚（Gary Kamiya）的《酷灰城之恋》（Cool Gray City of Love），他是一位长期居住在旧金山的居民。这本书深入探讨了旧金山的历史、社区，甚至是地理，我通过阅读这本书发现了城市里许多小角落，所以我向住在旧金山的人推荐它。\n\nLenny (42:46):\n除了这个播客，你还喜欢听哪个播客？\n\nVijay Iyengar (42:50):\n我选一个非科技类的。我是《白宫风云》（The West Wing）的忠实粉丝，所以有一个播客叫《The West Wing Weekly》，它会深入探讨《白宫风云》的每一集，并邀请剧中的演员以及政府官员来讨论每一集，如果你喜欢《白宫风云》，听起来简直是一种享受。\n\nLenny (43:06):\n等等，他们回顾老剧《白宫风云》，和政治家们讨论老剧集？\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:11):\n是的。\n\nLenny (43:12):\n那很酷。\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:12):\n是的。\n\nLenny (43:13):\n哇。\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:14):\n没错。所以节目已经结束了。播客也结束了。\n\nLenny (43:18):\n哦，好的。\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:18):\n你有全部七季，但我想它是在2016年或2015年左右开始的。\n\nLenny (43:22):\n明白了。太酷了。最近你特别喜欢哪部电影或电视剧？\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:27):\n口味比较大众化。我真的很喜欢《我们崩坏了》（We Crashed）和《人生切割术》（Severance）。这两部剧是我去年非常喜欢的。\n\nLenny (43:35):\n太棒了。你在面试时最喜欢问的面试问题是什么？\n\nVijay Iyengar (43:39):\n我非常喜欢开放式问题，所以我会在行为面试（behavioral interview）的开始问的一个问题是：“从大学到现在，或者如果他们是更初级的候选人，从高中到现在，给我讲讲你的故事。”这里有几个有趣的点，有趣地看人们把大部分时间花在哪里讲述，以及他们不讲哪里，还有他们如何描述旅途中遇到的其他人。他们是用一个标准框架来描述每个人，还是独特地深入到每个人？所以，从这个问题可以引出大量后续问题。\n\nLenny (44:09):\n最后一个问题是，在业界，你最尊敬的思想领袖是谁？\n\nVijay Iyengar (44:14):\n我从吉布森·比德尔（Gibson Biddle）和他的产品战略文章中获得了很多启发。特别是关于代理指标（proxy metrics）以及你应该使用的指标形态的一篇文章，我发现他描述的方式是一种非常优雅的方法，可以同时衡量指标的覆盖面（reach）和影响（impact）。另外，我非常喜欢Coda的Shishir，尤其是他关于[听不清 00:44:37]问题、问题框架的论文，以及关于边际流失贡献（marginal churn contribution）的那篇。那真的很有趣。\n\nLenny (44:42):\n太棒了。他们两位都是本播客的嘉宾，也是我非常喜欢的人。选择得很好。Vijay，这次谈话太棒了。非常感谢你加入我。最后两个问题。如果人们想联系你，了解你最近在做什么，他们可以在哪里找到你？另外，听众们能为你做些什么？\n\nVijay Iyengar (44:57):\n我在Twitter和LinkedIn上都有账号。我想我的用户名会在节目说明中。虽然我不是很活跃，但我一定会查看私信，很乐意在任何一个平台上与大家联系。至于听众能为我做些什么？是的，我的意思是，Mixpanel最终是为产品团队构建产品的。所以有两件事。如果你在过去四年里没有使用过Mixpanel，我们已经改变了很多，正如我在播客中描述的那样，所以请查看一下，我很乐意接受任何反馈，帮助我们改进产品。\n\nLenny (45:23):\n太棒了，Vijay，非常感谢。\n\nVijay Iyengar (45:26):\n谢谢你，Lenny。很棒的经历。\n\nLenny (45:29):\n非常感谢你的收听。如果你觉得这很有价值，可以在Apple
