Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?\n\nMarc Benioff (00:09):\nI'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17):\nYour stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.\n\nMarc Benioff (00:24):\nI actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30):\nAI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?\n\nMarc Benioff (00:38):\nI keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44):\nAs a founder, you're just like, \"Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (00:50):\nNo, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, \"Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01):\nToday, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:00):\nExcited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:04):\nI'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-\n\nMarc Benioff (04:26):\nYou.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:26):\n... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?\n\nMarc Benioff (04:28):\nThere's a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:29):\nOkay.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:30):\nSalesforce.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:30):\nSalesforce.com.\n\nMarc Benioff (04:32):\nThat all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, \"Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?\" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, \"Hey, I need to go and take some time off.\"\n\n(05:13):\nSo I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:00):\nSo one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?\n\nMarc Benioff (06:09):\nIt's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.\n\n(07:10):\nOkay. So you can just imagine like you're like, \"Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie.\" There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.\n\n(07:56):\nHe says to me, \"Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?\" I'm like, \"Yes, sir. I will do that.\" He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, \"I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that.\" It's this cool device. I'm like, \"That's such a cool screen. Steve.\" He goes, \"Oh, thanks so much.\" I go, \"Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs.\" \"No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not.\"\n\n(08:34):\nThat's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, \"Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this.\" So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, \"I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him.\" He's like, \"Come down here right away.\"\n\n(09:03):\nSo, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, \"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now.\" I'm like, \"Okay. What are they?\" He go, \"Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over.\" \"Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\" \"Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce.\" The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. \"And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do.\" I'm like, \"Yes, sir. What is it?\" \"You better go build an application economy.\" \"An application economy?\" \"Yes.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out.\"\n\n(09:55):\nIt was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, \"I think he wants me to build an app store.\" At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.\n\n(10:34):\nSo I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, \"This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other.\" Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, \"Hey, come down and see me.\" This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, \"I'll be right down.\"\n\n(11:08):\nI get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, \"I brought you all down here today.\" It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, \"And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store.\" All of our people go, \"Huh.\" They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, \"Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even...\"\n\n(11:51):\nThen, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, \"Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?\" He goes, \"Of course.\" Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, \"Steve, I'm going to give you a gift.\" \"Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?\" \"Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL.\" He's like, \"Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much.\" That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:59):\nThere's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.\n\nMarc Benioff (13:08):\nHe is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, \"I'll go look at it for you.\" So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, \"Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea.\"\n\n(13:41):\nThen, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, \"Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought.\" He goes, \"Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined.\" It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:14):\nI feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:16):\nYeah. Oh, no, I have hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:19):\nYes, you can.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:20):\nI have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:21):\nOh, man.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:22):\nYeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:24):\nBy the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, \"You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace.\"\n\nMarc Benioff (14:30):\nOh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:31):\nYeah, he did.\n\nMarc Benioff (14:35):\nHe's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, \"Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career.\" I'm like, \"I love it, Steve.\" \"No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great.\" It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:06):\nYeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:12):\nHe was rarely wrong, by the way, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:14):\nHe was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:44):\nI think you read one of my books, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:46):\nI know the history of a lot of these things.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:48):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:49):\nIt's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.\n\nMarc Benioff (15:54):\nIt was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, \"The end of software is near,\" and all kinds of other... \"No software,\" and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, \"Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software.\" So we have picketers outside of the streets.\n\n(16:50):\nAnyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:06):\nI love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.\n\nMarc Benioff (18:10):\nIt was crazy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:12):\nI love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-\n\nMarc Benioff (18:18):\n\"Frivolous\" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:21):\nSo what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word \"Salesforce\" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?\n\nMarc Benioff (18:42):\nWell, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, \"It's just going to be about Agentforce.\" I'm trying to think about, \"What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?\" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.\n\n(19:25):\nWe're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?\n\n(20:04):\nI'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, \"We'll cut ads for you.\" They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?\n\n(20:35):\nI am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?\n\n(20:58):\nI'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.\n\n(21:33):\nI'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:03):\nThere's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.\n\nMarc Benioff (22:31):\nWell, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.\n\n(23:15):\nI think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, \"What is my beginner's mind?\" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, \"What could work?\" rather than saying, \"Oh, I know what is going to work,\" or, \"This is the one thing that is going to definitely work,\" or, \"We have to do this.\"\n\n(24:10):\nAs soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, \"Here, we have to do all these things.\" Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, \"There's six things I really want to get done,\" but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.\n\n(24:56):\nNumber four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.\n\n(25:23):\nThe last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. I use Coda every day to coordinate my podcasting and newsletter workflows from collecting questions for guests to storing all my research to managing my newsletter content calendar.

Coda.io/lenny.\n\n(26:57):\nI love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?\n\nMarc Benioff (27:18):\nWell, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, \"All good things. Steve Jobs.\" I said, \"What did he do over here?\" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.\n\n(28:04):\nI've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, \"You know, I think we got to go.\"\n\n(28:38):\nAnyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.\n\n(29:06):\nThat music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:41):\nBy the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.\n\nMarc Benioff (29:41):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:49):\nI don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].\n\nMarc Benioff (29:48):\nThey are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:53):\nI want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, \"Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years.\"\n\nMarc Benioff (30:11):\nWe are too complicated. I agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:12):\nOkay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:25):\nWow, I didn't even know that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:27):\nRoughly.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:29):\nI actually never look at the stock.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:29):\nOkay.\n\nMarc Benioff (30:31):\nI find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.\n\n(31:05):\nI am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (31:47):\nI want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word \"agent,\" I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, \"What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?\" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?\n\nMarc Benioff (32:09):\nYeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, \"Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?\" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.\n\n(32:51):\nThat is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.\n\n(33:22):\nI'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, \"Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent.\"\n\n(33:58):\nThen, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.\n\n(34:45):\nThat is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, \"Hey, did you drink the water?\" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, \"Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?\" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:25):\nThere's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.\n\nMarc Benioff (35:43):\nYeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:09):\nSpeaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, \"Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime.\" When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, \"Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (36:33):\nWell, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, \"Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?\" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.\n\n(37:18):\nThis week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, \"Wow, this is going to get more and more intense.\" One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.\n\n(38:00):\nSo that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.\n\n(38:29):\nWhen you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:21):\nYou mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:34):\nThat was another domain name that you owned.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\nWell, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:36):\nMy view is blocked.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\nOh, I'll go grab him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:52):\nTotally. Okay. Let's check it out.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:54):\nThere he is. Ugh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:55):\nShow and tell Segment in the podcast.\n\nMarc Benioff (39:55):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:59):\nOh, cute.\n\nMarc Benioff (40:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:00):\nThat's a big old Einstein.\n\nMarc Benioff (40:02):\nThat's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:12):\nVery cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, \"Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents.\" I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, \"Marc Benioff says everyone is not working,\" but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?\n\nMarc Benioff (40:35):\nWell, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.\n\n(41:06):\nThen, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.\n\n(41:56):\nLook, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:21):\nSo what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?\n\nMarc Benioff (42:27):\nRight now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:31):\nThat touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-\n\nMarc Benioff (42:57):\nYeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:01):\nMm.\n\nMarc Benioff (43:01):\nSo we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined \"beta\" and \"data\" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.\n\n(43:51):\nThen, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, \"Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now.\" By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.\n\n(44:18):\nGreat entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, \"Great.\" We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, \"Now, we want to buy it back.\" Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.\n\n(44:56):\nI think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.\n\n(45:20):\nI think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, \"I'm just going to play the clarinet.\" For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, \"Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder.\" It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:02):\nSpeaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, \"Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes,\" and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?\n\nMarc Benioff (46:35):\nSure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, \"Whoa, what are we going to do?\" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.\n\n(47:12):\nOne of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.\n\n(47:33):\nNow, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.\n\n(47:58):\nSo I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, \"Oh, boy.\" If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.\n\n(48:51):\nIt was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.\n\n(49:17):\nI was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.\n\n(49:39):\nMy friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, \"There is no linear success.\" So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:33):\nOne of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.\n\nMarc Benioff (50:54):\nWell, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, \"Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name.\" I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.\n\n(51:30):\nIf you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, \"Better, better, better. Never best.\" It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.\n\n(52:10):\nSo we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (52:47):\nI'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, \"Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?\"\n\nMarc Benioff (52:54):\nNo, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, \"Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing.\" In some ways, you have to be saying, \"I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation.\" Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?\n\n(53:18):\nSee, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, \"Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?\" I said, \"Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (53:54):\nFor $75.\n\nMarc Benioff (53:54):\nFor $75, and they said, \"Thank you for...\" and then they said, \"Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?\" I'm like, \"No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me.\" I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, \"What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job.\"\n\n(54:45):\nSo they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, \"What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?\" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:21):\nAbsolutely.\n\nMarc Benioff (55:22):\nI jumped on that one little thought. \"Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to...\" It's like, \"No, that's what you want.\" By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:43):\nWhy?\n\nMarc Benioff (55:43):\nI want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, \"Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them.\" Wow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:23):\nHe's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:26):\nAmazing,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:27):\nAmazing.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:27):\nNo one like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:29):\nYeah.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:29):\nNever seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:34):\nSame. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:40):\nOh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:49):\nSame, Marc Benioff.\n\nMarc Benioff (56:50):\nWe're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:53):\nI feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.\n\n(56:56):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):\n我想把话题拉回到 Salesforce 创立之初。那是创业史上最传奇的发布活动之一。回过头来看，为了吸引人们的注意力，你当时做对了什么？有什么经验可以分享吗？\n\nMarc Benioff (00:09):\n我当时是把所有的东西都往墙上扔（意指尝试各种方法），看哪个能粘得住。我正在努力寻找那个制胜战术，并将其转化为一种长期的胜选策略（Winning Strategy）。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17):\n你们的股票现在正处于历史最高点。我很想知道，你认为是什么让你能够始终保持领先并持续增长？\n\nMarc Benioff (00:24):\n实际上我从来不看股票。我觉得股票非常让人分心。股票并不是目标，那不是我们做这件事的原因。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30):\nAI（人工智能）是我们这辈子，甚至可能是任何时代最具定义性的技术。你是从哪一刻开始意识到这一点的？\n\nMarc Benioff (00:38):\n我对 AI 一直有一种“存在主义式”的恐慌感（Existential freakout）。它的发展速度真的非常快。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44):\n作为创始人，你可能会觉得：“天哪，我才刚刚习惯 AI，公司里每个人都想搞 AI，现在我们又得去搞明白什么是智能体（Agents）了？”\n\nMarc Benioff (00:50):\n不，不，不。那是错误的。你需要的是这样的心态：“噢，下一个大事件要来了，我等不及想看到它了。”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01):\n今天我的嘉宾是 Marc Benioff。他是 Salesforce 的联合创始人兼 CEO。Salesforce 是全球第二大 B2B SaaS（企业级软件即服务）公司，在本次录音时市值约为 3500 亿美元，年营收达

(04:00):\n很高兴终于能和你联系上，也很高兴能和你一起做这期播客。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:04):\n我比你更兴奋。实际上我想从一件我认为大多数人都不了解你的事情开始，但在我看来，这几乎是你前瞻性和远见的缩影。那就是你曾经拥有过许多史诗级的顶级域名（Domain names）。例如，bill.com, you.com——\n\nMarc Benioff (04:26):\nYou。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:26):\n……code.com，还有 appstore.com。首先，还有哪些是我不知道的吗？\n\nMarc Benioff (04:28):\n还有很多。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:29):\n好吧。\n\nMarc Benioff (04:30):\nSalesforce.com。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:30):\nSalesforce.com。\n\nMarc Benioff (04:32):\n这些都源于……我会告诉你的。这其实是一个好故事。当时我在 Oracle（甲骨文）工作了 10 年，从 1986 年开始，1996 年转眼就到了。突然间，我意识到：“哇，过去十年发生了什么？”十年光阴飞逝。那太疯狂了。那是我职业生涯中的一个重大时刻，我经历了一个巨大的飞跃。我从一个刚走出校门的孩子变成了为 Larry Ellison（拉里·埃里森，Oracle 创始人）工作的人。但 10 年后，我感到筋疲力尽，于是我对 Larry 说：“嘿，我需要休一段时间假。”\n\n(05:13):\n于是我去了夏威夷，在海边租了一个小房子。我也做了一些天使投资，那是一个很酷的时刻，我投资的一些公司开始上市，包括 Siebel Systems 和其他公司，比如 Saba Software。这些都是我在 Oracle 认识的人，比如 Tom Siebel 和 Bobby Yazdani。当时我对互联网非常着迷。我在 Oracle 已经研究了几年，所以我开始购买一批我认准的公司的域名。它们当时还不是公司，现在是了。但我当时认为这些名字有一天会成为伟大的公司，并反映了我认为的发展方向。是的，那已经是很久以前的事了。大概快 30 年了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:00):\n你拥有的其中一个域名是 appstore.com，我在你的书里读到，你把它送给了 Steve Jobs（史蒂夫·乔布斯）。你能分享一下这个故事吗？因为把这样一个史诗级的域名送人，这本身就是一个传奇故事。\n\nMarc Benioff (06:09):\n这是一个很棒的故事，但它其实是我和 Steve Jobs 关系的故事。1984 年我在读大学时，我有机会在 Apple（苹果）实习。我在 Macintosh（麦金塔电脑）上编写了第一段原生汇编语言（Native assembly language）。说出这种话感觉挺疯狂的，但事实确实如此，我在库比蒂诺 Bandley 路的苹果总部大楼里，为这些 Macintosh 68000 开发系统编写示例程序。并开始和 Steve Jobs 建立起关系……倒不是说我真的在和他对话。我当时只是一个 19 岁的、乳臭未干的小屁孩，但他就在大楼里跑来跑去。我们这边有一个装满各种果汁的冰箱；那边有一个按摩师在分发能量饮料和做按摩；大厅里有一辆摩托车；屋顶上挂着海盗旗；Steve Jobs 在到处跑，对每个人大喊大叫，那简直酷毙了。\n\n(07:10):\n好吧。所以你可以想象，你会觉得：“哇，这简直就像在电影里。”当时还有很多像电影一样的酷事在发生，那开启了我和他的关系。后来我进了 Oracle，我们就熟络了。再后来，我创办了 Salesforce。在 Salesforce 发展的过程中，我记得是 2000 年或 2001 年，我记不清具体时间了，我们参加他的一部皮克斯电影的首映礼，一起吃晚餐。晚餐有很多细节，如果我一直说下去，那故事就太长了。\n\n(07:56):\n他对我说：“Marc，听着，你现在做得很好。你有自己的公司 Salesforce。如果你需要任何帮助，一定要给我打电话，好吗？”我说：“是的，先生，我会的。”他拿出他的……他当时刚刚推出 iPod，他说：“我兜里揣着一千首歌。看看这个，那个，还有这些。”这是一个非常酷的设备。我说：“那个屏幕太酷了，Steve。”他说：“噢，多谢。”我说：“Steve，你也可以在上面放电影，不仅仅是……或者照片。你没必要只放歌。”他说：“不，Marc。我永远不会做那样的设备。绝对不会。”\n\n(08:34):\n这让你对他的人格有一点洞察——他绝对不会明确地说：“噢，是的，我要做一个能看电影、存照片、打电话的设备。”总之，Salesforce 在向前推进，但我感觉遇到了瓶颈，我需要突破我的障碍——写作障碍、创业障碍。于是我联系了他。他说：“马上到我这儿来。”\n\n(09:03):\n于是，我真的上了车，带了几个团队成员一起去见他。他说：“噢，是的。没错，你遇到瓶颈了。你现在需要做三件事。”我说：“好，哪三件？”他说：“第一，你的公司最好在 24 个月内比现在大 10 倍，否则就完蛋了。”我说：“噢，好的，先生。明白。”“第二，你最好为这个 Salesforce 自动化产品签下一个像雅芳（Avon）这样的大客户。他们有一支很棒的销售队伍（Sales force）。”当时雅芳的 CEO 就在他的董事会里，所以他想到了这个。“还有最后一件事，我告诉你你必须做。”我说：“是的，先生。是什么？”他说：“你最好去建立一个应用经济（Application economy）。”“应用经济？”“是的。”“那是什么意思？”“我不知道，但你要去把它搞清楚。”\n\n(09:55):\n那感觉就像是见到了你的导师，得到了一个禅宗公案（Zen koan）之类的，你……现在你得去解开这个谜题。我真的回去了，拿着会议的所有笔记。我一遍又一遍地翻看。最后，我想：“我觉得他是想让我建立一个应用商店（App store）。”在那一刻，我去了域名注册机构，买下了 appstore.com。然后我开始在 Salesforce 研发它，这样我们的平台就能拥有构建应用并销售它们的能力，你可以做所有这些事情。\n\n(10:34):\n所以我做了这一切，并在 2005 年或 2006 年推出了 AppExchange。我们没有称它为 App Store（应用商店），因为当我们在焦点小组（Focus groups）测试 App Store 这个名字时，客户说：“这不是一个应用商店。这是一个应用交换中心（App exchange）。我们要互相交换应用和功能。”总之，它推出了，后来 iPhone 也推出了。然后有一天他基本上对我说：“嘿，过来见我。”这大概是 iPhone 推出一年后。我说：“我马上到。”\n\n(11:08):\n我到了那儿，还带着几名团队成员。他们以前听过这个故事，等等。然后我们就坐在苹果的大礼堂里。不是在酒店或别的地方。我记得非常清楚，就像昨天一样。他说：“我今天把你们都请到这儿来。”那是场非常精彩的戏剧化表演。我永远做不到他那样，太不可思议了。他拿着那个东西，然后说：“我今天在这里向大家揭晓——App Store。”我们所有的人都“哈”的一声。他们都倒吸一口凉气，脸色惨白，因为他们心里想：“噢，Marc 已经念叨 App Store 好几年了。Steve 怎么能……”\n\n(11:51):\n然后，在发布会结束时……一切都结束了。所有人都离开了礼堂。他们都跑出去体验 App Store（应用商店）和所有这些新鲜玩意儿。我走下台。他一个人坐在那里忙着什么。就在舞台的一个角落里。我说：“嘿，史蒂夫，能跟你聊会儿吗？”他说：“当然可以。”他对我非常慷慨，非常友善。我说：“史蒂夫，我要送你一份礼物。”“哇，但是马克，你要送我什么？”“史蒂夫，我要送你一些你现在没有、但可能以后会需要的东西，那就是 appstore.com 这个域名，以及 App Store 的商标。因为在六年前我们那次会面之后，我最终注册了这些商标并买下了这个域名。”他当时的反应是：“哦，这太好了，但你知道 App Store 这玩意儿不会做大的。不过，还是非常感谢你。”这就是 App Store 的故事。这太神奇了。我和他的关系非常奇妙。我很感激能有这段关系，他在我的职业生涯和整个生活中都产生了巨大的影响。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:59):\n在你分享的所有内容中，有一条主线我非常喜欢。那就是“慷慨”是如何贯穿其中的——他帮助你，你帮助他，只是单纯地想要互相扶持。\n\nMarc Benioff (13:08):\n他是一个非常慷慨的人。我告诉你，只要是我请求他做的事，他从没拒绝过。我有太多的故事了，其中一个是当时我想买这栋房子，我不确定该不该买，犹豫不决。于是他就去了……他说：“我帮你去看看。”于是他去了，看了那栋房子，然后给我打电话说：“嗯，我不知道你到底该不该这么做，但这地方可能不错。也许挺好的。也许是个好主意。”\n\n(13:41):\n在那之后，我一直跟他发邮件，那时他病得很重，一切都让人很难过。然后，他给我发了一封邮件，那是他发给我的最后一封邮件。我说：“哇，这一切的结果比我想象的要好。”他回复道：“马克，一切的结果都比我们能想象到的要好得多。”这是一个非常优美的想法，同时也让人感到无比悲伤。那是我和他最后的通信。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:14):\n我觉得我们可以聊一整天关于史蒂夫·乔布斯的故事。\n\nMarc Benioff (14:16):\n是的。哦，不，我有几个小时的故事可以讲。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:19):\n是的，你可以。\n\nMarc Benioff (14:20):\n我有很多史蒂夫·乔布斯的故事，但是——\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:21):\n噢，伙计。\n\nMarc Benioff (14:22):\n是的。总之，这就是其中的几个。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:24):\n顺便说一句，我也很喜欢他在 B2B SaaS（Business-to-Business Software as a Service，企业对企业软件即服务）方面的建议，比如：“你需要一个大客户。你需要招聘客户经理，建立市场生态。”\n\nMarc Benioff (14:30):\n噢，他讨厌那些。他讨厌 SaaS，也讨厌我做 Enterprise software（企业级软件）。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:31):\n是的，他确实讨厌。\n\nMarc Benioff (14:35):\n他试图说服我不要做企业软件高管。他说：“马克，你打算怎么办？难道你要回家告诉你的孩子你在做企业软件？你卖给谁，CIOs（Chief Information Officers，首席信息官）？你见过他们吗？你怎么能做这个？我无法想象还有比这更糟糕的职业了。”我回他：“我喜欢这个，史蒂夫。”“不，马克，你不可能喜欢这个。这一点都不酷。”这真的很滑稽。他确实不喜欢那个领域，但即便如此，他还是非常支持我。他会经常给我打电话。其实这真的很了不起。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:06):\n是的。感觉这是他最后看走眼的一个地方，这很有趣，很有意思。我想换个话题。\n\nMarc Benioff (15:12):\n顺便说一句，他很少出错。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:14):\n他在 B2B SaaS 方面很少出错。3500 亿美元的价值，谁会想到它真的存在呢？说到这个，我想把镜头拉回到 Salesforce 的初创时期，以及你们发布 Salesforce 的时候。回想那时真的很疯狂，基本上，你在努力说服人们：软件的未来不在桌面软件，而是在 Cloud（云端），在 SaaS。你当时用了所有那些“软件终结”的标志。你们让吉祥物带着“No Software（告别软件）”的牌子到处走。你还在……我想那是 Siebel 的大会上，雇了一些假抗议者。那当时非常艰难。\n\nMarc Benioff (15:44):\n我想你读过我写的一本书，莱尼。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:46):\n我了解很多这些往事。\n\nMarc Benioff (15:48):\n噢，好的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (15:49):\n那是初创公司历史上最传奇的发布活动之一，所以我已经听过很多次了。\n\nMarc Benioff (15:54):\n那是一个疯狂的时刻。我的意思是，Siebel 当时确实是做 CRM（Customer Relationship Management，客户关系管理）的企业软件巨头，他们正在举行用户大会。我当时在寻找发布我们产品的机会，于是我们雇了一群演员。他们在旧金山举办这个活动，而旧金山是一个非常 Woke（觉醒/关注社会公正）的城市，所以人们都期待着有一场像样的抗议。于是我们去 Home Depot（家得宝，美国建材超市）买了些木牌，做了些标语，上面写着“软件的终结就在眼前”，还有各种各样的……“No Software”等等。我们在牌子上写了很多有趣的东西。我们在 Siebel 的会场外举行抗议，针对他们还在做软件业务，我们就像是在喊：“噢，不，我们必须摆脱软件。我们要创造软件的终结。”所以我们在街上安排了抗议者。\n\n(16:50):\n总之，他（Tom Siebel）亲自从大楼里走出来，真的非常生气。就在那时，我们按下一个按钮，另一群坐在面包车里的演员出来了，他们伪装成新闻报道小组。他们的台标是 KNMS，也就是 K No More Software（K 再无软件电台），我们就这样……他们开始采访那些抗议者。所以现在他以为这是媒体事件。他叫了警察。他非常生气。他是个很棒的人。顺便说一句，我爱汤姆·希贝尔。我认为他也是我们这一代最伟大的企业家之一。他当时气得冒烟，完全不知道发生了什么。他并不确切知道是我们干的，而我们正玩得不亦乐乎。那天晚上，我们在旧金山的一家顶级剧院举行了盛大的发布会。我们请了一支很棒的乐队，真的很……我们玩得很开心。那真的是一段美好的时光。那些都发生了。我记得非常清楚，那是 2000 年 2 月 22 日。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:06):\n我太喜欢这个了。我以前没听过这个故事中关于采访和记者的那部分。\n\nMarc Benioff (18:10):\n当时非常疯狂。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:12):\n我很喜欢。这听起来可能有些 Frivolous（儿戏/轻率），但我认为我想探讨的这其中的天才之处在于——\n\nMarc Benioff (18:18):\n“Frivolous”用得很好。可能确实挺儿戏的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:21):\n我猜想，你当时是想让人们知道 Salesforce 的存在，去进行差异化竞争，让名声传出去。我觉得这是很多创始人都在苦恼的事情。他们真的不知道该如何让名声传出去，如何让人们注意到。回顾那次成功，我想请教，关于你为了让“Salesforce”这个名字传开、为了让人们关注你们所做的事情，有什么正确的经验教训吗？\n\nMarc Benioff (18:42):\n嗯，莱尼，这个世界非常嘈杂，你能看出来。你上 Twitter（推特）看看，那里……我是说，到处都是噪音，你如何突围？我们今天也面临这个挑战。我们正在推出一个名为 Agentforce 的巨大新产品。我目前只为它工作了几个月。我在我们的 Dreamforce 大会上介绍了它，那是突围的一种方式——我把整个大会的主题定为“只关于 Agentforce”。我正在思考：“我需要做哪些事情来让我的公司、我的客户、所有人百分之百投入到 Agentforce 中？”因为我知道我现在有一个窗口期。\n\n(19:25):\n我们是第一，我们领先。我们现在已经有数百名客户在使用它了。我们自己也在用，这很神奇。我们已经把整个帮助中心的基础设施迁移到了 Agentforce。我们看到了惊人的结果。我们把人工转办（Human Escalation）的比例降低了 50%。我们正在通过机器人自动处理（Robotically）解决 83% 的咨询。这太不可思议了。那么，现在我该如何把这个信息传播出去？我该如何在全球范围内推广？我该如何找到我的“KNMS 时刻”，想出一些病毒式的、令人兴奋的东西？\n\n(20:04):\n我正在尝试很多不同的事情。我有马修·麦康纳（Matthew McConaughey）和伍迪·哈里森（Woody Harrelson）这两个朋友在帮我。他们说：“我们会帮你拍广告。”他们从未在广告中合作过，自从《真探》（True Detective）之后就没再合作过。他们是我的朋友。再说一次，他们是非常慷慨的人，竟然同意做这件事。到目前为止我们已经拍了三支广告。我把它们发在 Twitter 上，以获取大家的反馈。这主意好吗？\n\n(20:35):\n我正在运营 help.salesforce.com 这个网站，来展示我们能用它做什么。这是个好主意吗？我正在培训我所有的销售人员如何销售它。这是个好主意吗？我正在针对微软进行激进的营销，因为他们有一个非常糟糕的产品 Copilot，我必须针对它进行定位（Positioning）和营销。这是个好主意吗？我应该针对他们进行营销和定位吗？\n\n(20:58):\n我正在尝试很多事情，莱尼，而我正在做的，也是我向所有企业家推荐的。这里的关键在于“媒介即信息（The message is in the medium）”，也就是说，我正在努力寻找那个“致胜战术（Winning tactic）”，并将其转化为“致胜战略（Winning strategy）”。其实我不知道这些事情中哪一个会是发布这个产品最重要的一环，所以我正在尝试很多东西，就像那个老话说的：我把所有东西都往墙上扔，看看哪个能粘住。一旦我找到了那个东西，我就会把它作为我的战略来发扬光大，这就是我正在做的。\n\n(21:33):\n我甚至在扩大我的销售组织。我打算额外招聘 1000 到 2000 名客户经理（Account Executives），专门负责 Agentforce。所以我正在尽我所能去开启那个“电灯开关”，向客户展示这是一个降低成本、让事情变得更好的绝佳机会，并向他们证明：Salesforce 不仅仅是在管理你的数据，我们还是一个 Digital labor（数字劳动力）提供商。这就是现在的时机。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:03):\n那里有很多我非常喜欢的内容，这种尝试各种事物、寻找战术并使其成为战略的想法。感觉这其中也有一种专注，就是全力以赴专注于这一件事，然后为这件专注的事情尝试各种不同的获胜方式。还有一个元素……我刚刚邀请了赛斯·高汀（Seth Godin）参加播客，他的一个重要教训就是：要 Remarkable（卓越/值得讨论）。创造一些让人们议论纷纷的东西。我认为你正在做的这些明星代言广告就是一个很好的例子。\n\nMarc Benioff (22:31):\n嗯，他说的确实是一个核心想法，那就是你必须找到它，但找到它才是最难的部分。所以你必须像……我的一个朋友是喜剧演员克里斯·洛克（Chris Rock）。他所做的是，他不会直接带着所有的段子去拍 Netflix 特辑。他会在各种俱乐部测试他的笑话，做各种疯狂的事情。我不会列举他为了测试笑话所做的所有疯狂动作，但当他开始拍那个盛大的 Netflix 特辑时，他已经知道什么有效，什么无效了。所以，这是我们作为企业家都必须做的事情。我们需要测试很多东西。我们需要大量的 Experimentation（实验），而且我们不能太傲慢。\n\n(23:15):\n我认为另一件极其重要的事情是……我有三、四十年的深度冥想习惯，那就是我们必须培养自己的“初心” (Beginner's Mind)。我们必须以一种方式运用正念来清除一切杂念，然后回到“我的初心是什么？”在初学者的心中，有无限的可能性；但在专家的心中，可能性却寥寥无几，甚至在某些情况下可能完全没有。我做这一行很久了，从15岁就开始写软件，现在我60岁了。整整45年。我不想要一颗专家的心，我想要一颗初心。我该如何拥有那种初心呢？因为如果我能问“什么行得通？”而不是说“哦，我知道什么行得通”或者“这绝对是唯一行得通的办法”或者“我们必须这样做”，那些灵感才会向我涌来。\n\n(24:10):\n一旦你开始使用那样的词汇，你就知道自己注定会彻底崩溃并失败。你必须说：“在这里，我们需要做所有这些事情。”就像我现在的公司，我们刚刚开了全员大会。我说：“有六件事是我真正想完成的。”第一件事是我没能让每个人都把注意力集中在 Agentforce (Salesforce 推出的自主型 AI 智能体平台) 上，并且要真正关注那种能量。第二，我需要在公司内部寻找更多的“燃料”来推动这个想法，因为这显然是一个突破性的产品，所以我该如何让每个人都专注于此？第三，我认为非常重要的一点是，我们需要更多的分销能力。我们不通过加盟店销售，不通过经销商或转售商，我们是直销，所以我知道我需要更多的 Account Executives (客户经理/销售主管)。\n\n(24:56):\n第四，我需要讲述大量的客户故事。所以，第一，Customer Zero (零号客户，指公司内部率先使用自家产品进行测试) 就是我；第二，我需要告诉你们所有的故事。比如，你可以看到迪士尼的故事。我正为他们做大量的 AI (人工智能) 工作和 Agentforce 工作。让我给你们讲讲迪士尼的故事。我需要给你们讲那个故事，然后我们在公司周围有一个完整的生态系统，叫做 Trailblazers (开拓者，Salesforce 对其用户社区的称呼)，有数百万人熟悉我们的平台。他们都必须成为 Agentblazers (智能体开拓者)。\n\n(25:23):\n最后一件事是，我刚刚向所有 13.5 万名 Salesforce 客户发布了这款产品。它还处于萌芽阶段，他们需要开启它。我需要激励他们去启用它。这就是我一直在思考的六件事。所以这不仅仅是一件事。我正试图弄清楚它是什么，我需要一颗初心来评估如何前进、如何演变、如何激励、如何鼓舞、如何激发能量。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:51):\n本集节目由 Coda 赞助播出。我每天都使用 Coda

年的公司。显然，你会冥想，你在构建这种思维上投入了大量的精力和关注。但在公司内部很难做到这一点。在会议中、在领导力方面，或者在你的运营方式中，有没有什么做法可以在组织内传播这种思维方式？\n\nMarc Benioff (27:18):\n嗯，Salesforce 现在是全球第二大软件公司，但也是日本第二大软件公司，那是我投入了大量时间和精力的地方。我喜欢去那里，我喜欢去京都。当我去京都时，我喜欢去一些令人惊叹的禅寺。顺便说一句，那是史蒂夫·乔布斯 (Steve Jobs) 喜欢做的事情之一，他以前常去那些超棒的寿司店。京都有一个非常棒的店叫 Sushiiwa (寿司岩)。如果你进去，你会看到他给他们签的东西。上面写着：“万事如意。史蒂夫·乔布斯。”我问：“他在这一带都干了些什么？”他会去这家超棒的寿司店，然后去龙安寺 (Ryōan-ji)，也就是那座枯山水石庭寺庙。那是一座令人难以置信的、带有形而上学色彩的寺庙。\n\n(28:04):\n我去过那里，去了几十年了。我带了很多朋友去过。是的，你必须清空大脑，让灵感进来。你必须去接收它，你需要倾听。我记得我甚至带尼尔·杨 (Neil Young，著名音乐人) 去过那里。他是我在这个世界上最喜欢的人之一，显然，我热爱他的音乐。他的音乐是我整个人生的背景音乐。我们坐在那里，他陷入了极深的冥想，然后他开始走动。寺庙快关门了，他进入了一种状态 (in the zone)，我不想打扰他，但我心想：“那个，我觉得我们得走了。”\n\n(28:38):\n不管怎样，结果是我们在那儿的时候，他已经在脑子里写了一整张专辑，他基本上是在把它全部记录下来。这是令人难以置信的创作过程。听着，我们都在脑子里写一张专辑。你在写什么专辑？你在写什么音乐？你自己是如何进入那个状态的？你想成为一名伟大的企业家，想成为一名伟大的 CEO，你必须清空大脑，必须准备好去谱写那段音乐。\n\n(29:06):\n那段音乐可以是你的商业计划、你的产品计划、你的产品发布计划，就像我们讨论的我的 Agentforce 产品。这就是我们都在尝试做的事情，我也把京都这样的地方当作做这些事的地方，因为地理位置很重要。你在哪里很重要。我知道你在马林县 (Marin County)。也许你可以去塔马尔派斯山 (Mount Tam) 顶。也许你可以和杰克·康菲尔德 (Jack Kornfield) 一起去灵石修道院 (Spirit Rock)，在那里清空大脑。但你必须找到做这件事的地方，创造那个环境。它可能不在办公室里，可能在其他地方。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:41):\n顺便说一句，你的朋友圈太惊人了。你提到的这些人我都见过。\n\nMarc Benioff (29:41):\n好吧。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:49):\n我不知道这录音要录多久。[听不清 00:29:49]。\n\nMarc Benioff (29:48):\n他们很酷。我很幸运能遇到这么多酷的人。是的，我不知道我怎么会这么幸运遇到这些人。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:53):\n我想把视角稍微放大一点，谈谈……大约每个月我都会听说一家初创公司（我也做很多天使投资），他们基本上都试图颠覆 Salesforce，挑战 Salesforce。他们抨击你们的……别因为我说这个而杀了我，他们抨击你们的用户体验。他们说：“哦，太复杂了。它已经存在三到五年了（指竞争产品）。”\n\nMarc Benioff (30:11):\n我们确实太复杂了。我同意。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:12):\n好。我很好奇，你认为是什么让你能够保持领先并持续增长？我们今天录音的时候，你们的股价基本上处于历史最高点。\n\nMarc Benioff (30:25):\n哇，我甚至都不知道。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:27):\n大概是吧。\n\nMarc Benioff (30:29):\n我其实从不看股价。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:29):\n好的。\n\nMarc Benioff (30:31):\n我觉得股价非常让人分心，我也鼓励我的员工不要看股价，因为股价只是一种反映。钱不是目标，对吧？股价也不是目标。它是旅程终点的产物。那不是我们做这件事的原因。“旅程本身就是奖励。”这也是史蒂夫·乔布斯经常说的一句话。这里再次向史蒂夫·乔布斯致敬。我认为这非常重要，我把我司看作一家初创公司。\n\n(31:05):\n我是一名初创公司的 CEO。我是一名初创企业家。我仍然站在 Salesforce 的起点。无论我在 Salesforce 做什么，无论我是 CEO，还是有时担任董事会主席——比如上周我们开了董事会。有时我是一名产品经理。这是一家初创公司，虽然我们是一家有着 25 年历史、7.5 万名员工、380 亿美元年收入、3000 多亿美元市值的初创公司，但我们仍然是一家初创公司。我们有一些伟大的产品，但我们才刚刚开始。举个例子，Lenny，我们才刚刚开启“数字劳动力” (Digital Labor) 产业，我们有一个产品叫 Agentforce，而我们才刚刚起步。我们正处于起跑线上。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (31:47):\n我想稍微跳转一下话题，让我们聊聊 Agentforce。我知道就像你说的，这是你目前最关注的事情。这是你们正在做的一个巨大赌注。当人们听到“智能体” (Agent) 这个词时，我想很多人甚至不好意思问：“这到底长什么样？除了现在的 LLMs (大语言模型) 之外，Agent 到底是什么？”你能不能举个例子，说明你见过的可能让你大吃一惊的 Agent 能做的事情？\n\nMarc Benioff (32:09):\n有的。我在电影里见过。我在《少数派报告》(Minority Report) 里见过，那部电影是由我们的未来学家彼得·施瓦茨 (Peter Schwartz) 参与编剧的。汤姆·克鲁斯冲进 Gap 商店，突然间，店里说：“嘿。嘿，汤姆。你考虑过这件新衬衫吗？看看这些牛仔裤。你上次买了那个。现在，你可以试试这个。你可以试试那个。这个怎么样？那个怎么样？”它知道他的历史。它了解他。它知道发生了什么。这是 20 年前的事了。整个商店都在进行数字化改变，以反映他的兴趣和想法，并开始与他交流、与他合作。\n\n(32:51):\n那就是一个 Agent (智能体)。它不仅仅是我们在《黑客帝国》里看到的史密斯特工或其他什么。它是正在与你合作的“某人”。对我来说，用“某人”这个词是个有趣的口误。它是正在与你合作的“某种东西”。它可能是你手机里的一段软件。它可能是你家里的机器人。它可能是你的汽车，它认识你，了解你的偏好，对你有 Institutional Memory (机构记忆/长期记忆)，现在正在为你提供建议。\n\n(33:22):\n我给你举个例子……我经常去加州大学旧金山分校 (UCSF) 医院。事实上我最近正处于跟腱断裂的恢复期，所以我有很多互动。在医院，或者你在接受医疗保健、做实验检查、体检、扫描，无论是什么。总是有这些术前和术后，或者治疗前后的事项，你会接到这些电话。每次我接到电话，我都在想：“呃，这可能花掉他们 100 美元，而我们本来可以用 Agent 做的更便宜、更容易。”\n\n(33:58):\n而且，当我与 UCSF 的医生和护士交谈时，他们在疫情后都精疲力竭，因为他们要安排 Pajama Time (睡衣时间，指医护人员下班回家后处理电子病历的时间) 在晚上处理所有的数字信息。其实很多事情用 Agent 和 AI 可以做得更简单，我们会让他们的生活变得更好、更轻松、更简单。他们正在做的有些事情不需要亲自跟我谈论我的胆固醇数值，因为我拿到了实验报告，胆固醇数值就是这个或那个数字。很多事情可以通过技术完成，然后把重要的部分留给他们，比如当我去看病时，或者我想与一位经验丰富的医生面对面进行真正、深入、更有共情能力的交流。那对我来说是另一个全新的机会。\n\n以下是为您翻译的播客转录内容：\n\n(34:45):\n这就是智能体 (Agent)，或者说智能体就像……举个例子。我曾做过一次 CT 扫描 (CT scan)，你必须喝下这种显影剂 (contrast)，然后突然间，他们通过静脉注射 (IV) 给你，这样他们能拍出更好的照片。但随后，你必须喝水把显影剂排出体外。你觉得有人打电话给我说：“嘿，你喝水了吗？”吗？没有，没人打电话叫我喝水。你得自己记得。在美国医疗体系中，你只能靠自己。而智能体 (Agent) 会打电话给你说：“嘿，你喝水了吗？吃药了吗？需要复查吗？需要再去看看医生吗？”所以智能体 (Agent) 会守候在你身边。这就是一个医疗方面的例子。我们可以举出很多类似的例子。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:25):\n《纽约时报》 (The New York Times) 最近刚好有个报道，虽然不是专门讲智能体 (Agents) 的。它是关于 ChatGPT 和医生的对比，测试了医生单独诊断、ChatGPT 直接诊断、以及医生加上 ChatGPT 辅助诊断的能力。到目前为止，表现最好的是直接用 ChatGPT，把医生从等式中剔除。\n\nMarc Benioff (35:43):\n是的。他们写了一篇临床研究报告，以半同行评审 (semi-peer-reviewed) 的方式实际观察到，在很多情况下，ChatGPT 给出的诊断比医生更准确，因为医生在与病人接触时会有更多的先入为主的偏见 (bias)。所以这非常有趣，我认为我们都应该看看那项研究并思考一下。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:09):\n说到《纽约时报》，我其实发现了一段你的引言。你写过一篇关于 AI 的评论文章 (op-ed)。引言是这样说的：“在我的硅谷职业生涯中，我见证了无数次创新浪潮，但没有一次能与 AI 的深远影响相比。AI 是我们这一代，甚至可能是任何时代最具决定性的技术。”对你来说，是在哪一刻你开始意识到这一点，觉得“噢，天哪，这不仅仅是另一个炫酷的玩具”？\n\nMarc Benioff (36:33):\n嗯，我一直对 AI 有这种存在主义式的惊恐时刻 (existential freakout moments)，这在过去的几十年里发生过很多次。但对于我们这些伴随着《战争游戏》 (WarGames)、《少数派报告》 (Minority Report)、《她》 (Her) 这种电影，或者读过相关书籍成长的人来说……我最喜欢的 AI 书籍之一是《幽灵舰队》 (Ghost Fleet)。你会思考：“我们要把 AI 引向何方？AI 会走向何处？”对于 Salesforce，我回想我们的历程，我一直在等待这一刻的发生并试图带领大家前进，特别是在过去十年中我们开发了 Einstein 平台，现在又开发了 Agentforce 平台。\n\n(37:18):\n本周，在 Salesforce，我们可能会处理大约 2 万亿次 AI 交易 (AI transactions)。加上我们现在的总和，Einstein 和 Agentforce 平台，据我所知，我们绝对是全球最大的企业级 AI 交易提供商。我一直在想：“哇，这会变得越来越激烈。”第一步是我们必须自动化所有的客户接触点 (customer touch points)。比如我现在穿着迪士尼 (Disney) 铁粉的衬衫，我们运营着迪士尼商店和迪士尼导游系统，还有迪士尼地产、DisneyQuest 呼叫中心……迪士尼的方方面面。当你作为客户时，你就是在与 Salesforce 进行交互。\n\n(38:00):\n这就是我们热爱做的事情，自动化所有这些客户接触点：销售、服务、营销、分析、Slack，并使用 MuleSoft 将它们全部集成。这就是我们做的，然后将所有数据汇总到一个名为 Data Cloud (数据云) 的大数据库中，再将该 Data Cloud 与其他数据源联邦化 (federating)。所以这是我们一直在做的两个步骤：自动化客户接触点、汇总数据，而第三步就是建立在之上的智能体平台 (agentic platform)。\n\n(38:29):\n当你想到现在你可以去 help.salesforce.com，并在智能体层 (agentic layer) 解决你的问题时，这太神奇了。然后，出现的第四层将是机器人无人机层 (robotic drone layer)，这些机器人和无人机将利用平台及其所有的功能。这种对未来的愿景是我们业内人士多年来一直拥有的。这不是我个人的神奇愿景。这是一个早已存在的愿景。这是计算机科学的基础，即我们将从数据走向自动化。这就是我们所有人正在推动的方向，我们正在推动这个行业。我们不断地降低成本、提高易用性，并不断提升自动化程度。这非常有力量。这一切确实发展得很快。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:21):\n你简单提到了 Einstein。我也顺便提一下，我的狗也叫 Einstein (爱因斯坦)，我曾经得到过印有 Einstein 的周边袜子，我非常喜欢。另外，这也是你很早就买下了 einstein.com 域名的例子。\n\nMarc Benioff (39:33):\n是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:34):\n那是你拥有的另一个域名。\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\n嗯，我只是觉得 Einstein 会是一个讨论人工智能的绝佳名字，事实也确实如此。看，你可以在我身后的书架上看到他。我把他放在那儿。你看到 Einstein 了吗？我想他们当时是 [听不清 00:39:50]。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:36):\n我的视线被挡住了。\n\nMarc Benioff (39:36):\n噢，我去把他拿过来。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:52):\n没问题。好的，让我们看看。\n\nMarc Benioff (39:54):\n他在那儿。呃。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:55):\n播客中的“展示与讲述”环节。\n\nMarc Benioff (39:55):\n噢，是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:59):\n噢，真可爱。\n\nMarc Benioff (40:00):\n是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:00):\n那是个大个子的 Einstein 玩偶。\n\nMarc Benioff (40:02):\n这是我们 Salesforce 愿景的关键部分，我们的 Einstein 平台涵盖了我们正在做的一切。如果不先搞定这位老兄 Einstein，我们就无法实现 Agentforce。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:12):\n非常可爱。当你谈到这一切时，我猜很多人在想：“噢，天哪，未来不会有那么多人工作了。我们的工作该怎么办？AI 变成了智能体。”我知道你说的任何话都可能被断章取义，比如“Marc Benioff 说大家都不用工作了”，但我想……我知道你提到过明年不会招聘那么多工程师。我想知道是否有任何信息能帮助人们理解未来劳动力将如何变化？\n\nMarc Benioff (40:35):\n我可以谈谈我自己的公司，以及我是如何告诉我的员工的，那就是：是的，我们将不得不重新平衡我们的部分劳动力。你可以从我刚才给出的数字中看出来，我们需要更少的支持工程师 (support engineers)，因为我们通过 Agentforce 拥有了机器人支持层。这是非常现实的，我们都需要适应。与此同时，我正在招聘更多的客户经理 (account executives) 和人员来发展公司。所以我刚刚在全员大会 (all-hands call) 上鼓励大家思考这个问题。\n\n(41:06):\n然后，我刚才提到了医疗的例子。但关于医疗的一个有趣点是，我认为即将创造的很多工作……我们根本没有足够的人手去做，我认为世界上有很多事情需要帮助，但我们没有人手。所以我认为很多这些工作不一定会被取代。我在一个小镇有个家，那个小镇……非常像一个蓝领小镇。人们仍然在餐馆工作，开卡车，在超市工作，维修房屋，从事建筑、园艺。\n\n(41:56):\n看，我认为要等很长一段时间，我那个小镇的工作才会受到影响。但在我安家的那个大城市，旧金山，我刚才就给了你一个我认为工作会受到影响的例子。所以这字面上就是“双城记”，我认为你会在不同的地方看到不同的影响。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:21):\n所以我听到的是，支持人员的需求在下降，而客户经理和销售人员的需求在上升？\n\nMarc Benioff (42:27):\n目前这就是 Salesforce 的核心现状。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:31):\n这触及了我一直想聊的一点，那就是……现在很多创始人非常有产品思维，以产品为导向，他们想要建立“产品优先”的公司，实现“产品驱动增长” (product-led growth) 等等。我认为 Salesforce 在公开场合表现得非常“销售驱动”和“营销驱动”，而不是“产品驱动”。显然，产品是核心部分，它们协同工作。但我想请你给那些非常注重产品，可能对投入销售或客户服务犹豫不决的创始人一些建议……\n\nMarc Benioff (42:57):\n是的。我会说我们不是销售驱动的。好吧，让我们以 Agentforce 为例，对吧？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:01):\n嗯。\n\nMarc Benioff (43:01):\n我们正在运行这一年，这是我们的 25 财年 (fiscal year 25)，对吧？到明年 1 月底结束。Lenny，这一年是“数据云” (Data Cloud) 之年。原本这不应该是 Agentforce 之年。所以我说这是数据云之年。我刚才给你做过推介。我们已经实现了所有客户接触点的自动化。现在，我们正在为所有的客户实施方案中加入数据云。我们有 13.5 万名客户。我们已经在所有客户中实施了数据云。他们都需要启用它。我们的团队需要向客户展示如何构建数据云，以及它将如何帮助客户拥有更好的数据结构 (data structure)。我刚才差点把 “beta” 和 “data” 混在一起了。所以他们需要更好的数据结构、数据架构 (data architectures) 和数据文化。\n\n(43:51):\n然后我们有了突破，我可以告诉你这个故事。突然间我意识到：“哇，这个智能体技术 (agent technology) 的发展速度比我想象的要快得多，我们要现在就推向市场。”到 Dreamforce 大会 (Salesforce 年度盛会) 时，我们将采用这项令人难以置信的技术。我们极大地加速了它的进程，因为我们收购了一家名为 Airkit 的公司，这是我们的 Ohana (夏威夷语，意为“家人”，Salesforce 的企业文化关键字) 成员之一……这是一个很棒的故事。\n\n(44:18):\n一位伟大的企业家拥有这家公司，一家非常棒的公司叫 RelateIQ，我们在很多年前，大约 10 年前买下了它。他在我们这里待了很多年，大概六七年，后来想离开，我们说：“太棒了。”我们给了他离开的投资，通过 Salesforce Ventures 投资了他的公司，他建立了这个惊人的平台，然后我们说：“现在，我们想把它买回来。”他在大约一年前回来了，这加速了智能体愿景的实现，然后我们在 10 月底交付了 Agentforce 的生产代码 (production code)。所以，突然之间，我们现在发布了这款产品。\n\n(44:56):\n我认为对于企业家来说，意识到这不仅仅关乎产品是非常重要的。不仅仅关乎销售，不仅仅关乎营销，不仅仅关乎会计，不仅仅关乎你的投资者，不仅仅关乎你的员工，不仅仅关乎你的利益相关者 (stakeholders)。它关乎一切，所以你最好准备好做一个管弦乐团的指挥。你不能只吹单簧管 (clarinet)。\n\n(45:20):\n我认为这就是你想要表达的，有些企业家会觉得：“我只想吹单簧管。”对于这些人，我认为他们无法达到应有的高度。你应该演奏整个交响乐，让每个人都跑起来。那部交响乐就是销售、服务、营销、产品。你的股东、利益相关者、客户的每一个部分。你必须不断地演奏整个交响乐，你必须有宏大的格局去思考：“哇，我的公司有很多利益相关者，而不仅仅是一个。”这不仅仅是关于产品和技术。如果你把自己局限在窄播 (narrowcast) 模式，你不仅是对不起你自己，也对不起其他所有人。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:02):\n说到“广大的心” (Big Mind) 和“初心” (Beginner’s Mind)，我们播客有一个固定环节，我称之为“失败角落” (Fail Corner)。之所以设立这个环节，是因为来参加播客的嘉宾总是分享诸如“一切都很顺利、我们做得非常棒、我取得了所有这些成功”之类的故事，这会让听众感到气馁，因为他们听到的都是成功，而现实中人们经常面临失败。所以我尝试请嘉宾分享一个故事，我也想问问你：能不能分享一个你曾深陷困境、事情变得非常糟糕，但你最终克服并从中有所收获的故事？\n\nMarc Benioff (46:35):\n当然可以。我就举这个例子吧。大约两年前，我们公司经历了一场巨大的转型，期间发生了很多疯狂的事情。那种感觉有点像我们都在这架飞机上，本来一切运行良好，突然间，事情似乎变得非常糟糕。我们往驾驶舱看去，发现两名飞行员似乎都不见了，接着那个背着降落伞的家伙也跳下了飞机，我们当时心想：“哇，我们该怎么办？”为了让公司重获新生，我们当时不得不采取一些非常疯狂、甚至在某种程度上具有破坏性的举措。\n\n(47:12):\n两年前我们做的其中一件事就是策划裁员 (Architect a layoff)，而我们以前从未进行过如此大规模的裁员。为了挽救公司，我们不得不解雇公司 10% 的员工。我真的不想这么做，作为一名企业家，调整员额 (Headcount) 是我最不愿意做的事。但当时我们正走出疫情，而我们之前雇佣了太多的人。\n\n(47:33):\n事实证明，硅谷的很多公司在疫情期间都采取了同样的策略。疫情期间业务增长非常强劲，以至于我们过度招聘 (Overhiring)。等到疫情结束时，我们的员工数量已经超负荷了。我能知道什么呢？那是我经历的第一场全球大流行。等到下一次大流行时，我就知道这其中会伴随经济周期和通胀周期了。\n\n(47:58):\n所以我在疫情中学到了很多，而现在我们回到了这里。两年前，我们突然开始策划这次裁员，在执行裁员时，我试图过度沟通 (Overcommunicate)，召开了全体员工大会，结果场面简直是一场灾难 (Dumpster fire)，是一场噩梦。我在媒体和 Twitter (现 X) 上遭到抨击，所有人都在攻击我。当时我想：“噢，天哪。”如果说我以前脸皮厚，那么那一刻我的抗压能力 (Thick skin) 变得更强了，因为无论如何这种事都不会顺利。确实，过程很不顺利，但我们挺过来了。现在你在播客里给我这些赞誉，称赞我们在财务、结构以及产品创新方面的现状，这非常好，但两年前我们可不是这样的。\n\n(48:51):\n当时很明确，我们必须进行财务转型，包括调整员额 (Headcount)；同时我们也必须进行技术、产品和创新的转型。这两件事要求我们做很多事，而且过程会很痛苦。所以我们必须经历这些痛苦，才能获得现在的收益，这绝非易事。\n\n(49:17):\n两年前经历这些时我很震惊，因为我已经经营这家公司 23 年了，一直发展得不错。是的，期间有很多失败，但我没料到会有另一个巨大的危机袭来。但你猜怎么着？总会有巨大的问题接踵而至，而且还会有更多，这就是本质。\n\n(49:39):\n我的朋友 Michael Bell 也许是我认识的最优秀的企业家。他说：“没有所谓的线性成功 (Linear success)。”这意味着你刚才提到的股票图表，不会有一条完美的、一直向右上方延伸的直线。我不在乎你是谁，苹果公司没有这样的曲线，谁都没有。变化总会发生，可能是经济变化，可能是社会变化，也可能是疫情。不存在一路向右上的增长。如果你认为成功只会是持续增长，那你选错了行，或者说你对生活的认知错了。或许修道生活 (Monastic life) 更适合你，在那里你可以生活在一种更稳定的状态 (Steady state) 中。但如果你想要更多波动而非稳态，那么创业生活就像是一台摇滚版的过山车 (Rock-and-roll roller coaster)，你得做好准备，因为它随时会冲击你。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:33):\n说到过山车，你提到的那些从飞机上跳下去的人之一就是你的前联合首席执行官 (Co-CEO) Bret Taylor。让我觉得有趣的是，他也全身心投入到了智能体 (Agents) 领域。这让我想起了一个梗：Ilya (Sutskever) 在离开 OpenAI 并试图赶走 Sam Altman 时到底看到了什么。我也很好奇，关于智能体 (Agents) 是未来趋势这一点，你们到底看到了什么，以至于你们都如此投入？这非常有意思。\n\nMarc Benioff (50:54):\n我觉得智能体 (Agents) 是我们所有人将要致力于的最重要的事情之一，我认为每个人都会转向智能体。你看，我今天刚听说 Google 推出了 Agentspace。起初我想：“好吧，看来他们喜欢 Agentforce 这个名字。”我非常爱 Sundar (Pichai)，他是我在世界上最喜欢的人之一。我们听说 Microsoft 现在也有智能体了，我读到 Oracle 也有了，SAP 也有了。每个人都有智能体了，这很好，这就是我们想要的，我们不想成为唯一的一家。\n\n(51:30):\n如果你是唯一的玩家，而没有其他人在这方面努力，那你其实就有麻烦了。所以你不想单打独斗，你想要在一个市场中。你不想成为唯一一家提供解决方案的公司，你希望在一个竞争激烈的市场中，有人与你竞争，你与别人竞标，这样你会变得更好，不断前进。就像汽车行业，我最敬佩的人之一是丰田章男 (Akio Toyoda)。丰田先生现在是丰田的会长，曾任首席执行官。他的祖父创立了丰田。他说：“更好，更好，更好，永无止境 (Better, better, better. Never best.)。”这就是日本的“改善” (Kaizen) 精神。\n\n(52:10):\n我们谈到了日本的“初心” (Shoshin)，意味着初学者的心态。现在我们又学到了另一个日语词——“改善” (Kaizen)。“改善”就是持续改进，你需要不断进行持续改进。以我们目前的智能体 (Agents) 现状来看，每个软件行业都会向智能体转型。我们必须像每个软件行业一样……至少在客户关系管理 (CRM) 或自动化客户触点 (Customer touchpoints)、数据和管理数据，以及构建数据基础设施 (Data infrastructure) 方面，智能体是核心，这一切都是相关的，我们都在朝着同一个方向前进。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (52:47):\n我只是在想，作为一个创始人，你可能会想：“天哪，我刚习惯了 AI (人工智能)，公司里每个人都想搞 AI，现在我们还得去搞明白智能体 (Agents) 到底是怎么回事？”\n\nMarc Benioff (52:54):\n不，不，不。这种想法是错误的。你需要那种心态，你想要的是这种心态：“噢，下一个新事物要来了，我迫不及待想看到它。”在某种程度上，你必须说：“我迫不及待想经历下一次失败，迫不及待想迎来下一次成功，迫不及待想看到下一次创新。”噢，这就是整体的创新，对吧？\n\n(53:18):\n你看，我们处于一个技术成本不断降低、使用越来越方便、自动化程度越来越高的行业。如果你像我一样已经在这个行业干了二十五年、四十年，甚至四十五年……我刚入行时，使用的电脑叫 TRS-80 Model I，只有 4K 的内存 (RAM)。我最近做播客，他们问：“你把第一款软件卖给谁了？”我说：“我把它卖给了加州戈利塔的《CLOAD》杂志……”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (53:54):\n卖了 75 美元。\n\nMarc Benioff (53:54):\n卖了 75 美元。他们说：“谢谢你……”然后问：“噢，太棒了，那你给他们寄磁盘了吗？”我说：“不，不，当时没有磁盘。CLOAD 代表 BASIC 语言中的磁带加载指令 (Cassette Load in BASIC)。那是 BASIC 语言里的命令，C-L-O-A-D，代表磁带加载。那是他们杂志的名字，你每个月会收到一盒磁带，里面有五六个他们从像我这样的人手里买来的程序。”我是说，他们根本不知道自己是从加州伯林盖姆高中的一个 15 岁高中生手里买的。但我写了一个“如何变戏法” (How to Juggle) 的程序，他们花了 75 美元买下了。他们给我寄了一份一页纸的协议，我签了字。然后我告诉父母，他们说：“什么？啊？你在干什么？噢，好吧。真棒，亲爱的，干得好。”\n\n(54:45):\n所以他们不理解，没人理解。那太疯狂了。那是 1978 年或 1979 年，没人知道我在卖软件。我还在上高中。那只是时间长河中的一个瞬间，但我需要始终保持那种心态，即：“下一个伟大的事物是什么？下一个伟大的成功是什么？下一个伟大的失败是什么？”你在成长，你在进化，你在从中学习。这就是你想要的，你想要拥有那种成长型思维 (Growth mindset)，对吧？你想要拥抱它。我说的有道理吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:21):\n完全有道理。\n\nMarc Benioff (55:22):\n我刚才抓住那个念头不放，“噢，天哪，我现在控制住局面了，但现在又有了智能体，我现在该怎么办……”不，这就是你想要的。顺便说一句，我也想要智能体之后的东西，以及再之后的东西。这就是未来的迷人之处，它正在到来。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:43):\n为什么这么说？\n\nMarc Benioff (55:43):\n我想成为……我们的一位客户说过这句话，人们以为是我说的，其实不是。我想“率先到达未来，并欢迎我们的客户到来”。这就是我认为……顺便说一句，这也是我认为埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 做得非常出色的地方。他就像……我不知道为了预见未来他做了多少疯狂的事，他显然在做一些不寻常的事，但他就像是在说：“是的，未来我们将拥有机器人、脑机接口 (Brain machine interfaces)，并驾驶电动汽车。所有这些事都会在未来发生，而我将拥有 10 家公司来完成所有这些事。”哇。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:23):\n他不仅在思考，还在一件一件地付诸实践。\n\nMarc Benioff (56:26):\n太神奇了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:27):\n确实神奇。\n\nMarc Benioff (56:27):\n没有人像他这样。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:29):\n是的。\n\nMarc Benioff (56:29):\n从未见过类似的人，我都不明白这怎么可能做到。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:34):\n同感。Marc，我知道你得赶时间。这次对话太棒了，我觉得这是个完美的结尾。\n\nMarc Benioff (56:40):\n噢，Lenny，你太有趣了。我一直期待上你的播客聊聊创业，感谢你为这个行业和各地的创业者所做的一切。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:49):\n我也一样，Marc Benioff。\n\nMarc Benioff (56:50):\n我们都非常感激你。再见，欢迎随时交流。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:53):\n我也有同感。谢谢。再见，各位。\n\n(56:56):\n非常感谢大家的收听。如果你觉得这一集有价值，可以在 Apple Podcasts、Spotify 或你喜欢的播客应用上订阅。此外，请考虑给我们评分或留下评论，这能真正帮助其他听众发现这个播客。你可以在 lennyspodcast.com 找到过往的所有剧集或了解更多关于节目的信息。下期节目再见。",
