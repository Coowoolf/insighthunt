If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, you get dramatically better answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):\nI know you have a bunch of awesome advice on becoming more influential.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:16):\nIt's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game. The starting point is to choose your character. Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy, your personality kind of has a natural fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\nHow do we create better relationships within our teams?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:33):\nIt's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience? If the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet. You got to fix that first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nI'm really excited for this episode. I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:52):\nThen here's the surprise ending.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nToday, my guest is Evan LaPointe. Evan is the founder of CORE Sciences, which teaches companies and individuals how our brains actually work, and through that lens, how to more effectively work with other people on teams, how to build better products, how to grow your business, and how to make smarter and faster decisions. Evan is a four-time founder, including founding a company called Satellite, which is the fourth largest analytics product on the internet today, which was acquired by Adobe where he later ran product strategy and innovation for Adobe's digital business.\n\n(00:01:31):\nIn our conversation, Evan shares a simple way to understand how our brains work, and through that framework, how we can get better at vision work, influence, running meetings, having more focus and building better and more productive relationships with our colleagues. This conversation is a beautiful mix of science, theory, and also, a ton of very actionable and concrete things you can do to be more effective in your work.

With that, I bring you Evan LaPointe. Evan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:16):\nThanks very much for having me. I'm excited to share some stuff with people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:19):\nI am really excited for this episode because one, I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast. Two, I think it's going to really stretch our brains as we learn about how the brain works. Three, I think it's really going to make an impact on how people work and how they relate to other people and work with other people. I thought it'd be great to start by laying a little bit of foundation for people to get a sense of just what they need to understand about how the brain works before we get into how we can actually apply some of the stuff. Could you just share some of the stuff that is really important for us to know about how the brain works?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:53):\nThe brain is like a big galaxy. There's a National Geographic quote that we throw up in all of our programs that when we train teams, for example, that says the brain is more complex than any known structure in the universe. It's easy to read a sentence like that and just run straight away from the problem. I think that's important for people to not run away from this problem but more run toward it. It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember. The three or four main systems to stack on top of each other like layers, start with the fact that the brain has systems. I think of it like the brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it, and your brain has a science department responsible for open-minded experimentation.\n\n(00:03:39):\nIt has an art department in it responsible for creative boundless thinking. It has a history department designed for looking stuff up that you already know. If you think about sending your thoughts to the right department on the campus or just different departments, you're going to get super different responses back from your brain. Where we're stuck largely is most people rely on their history department way too much. That's because the brain is actually built to conserve energy, and that's the lowest energy form of generating an answer to a question that the brain can pull off. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, the humanities department of your compassion, et cetera, you get totally different answers. Certainly, if you ever build products as a company or offer services, those departments are going to give you dramatically better answers than the reference material just in your history department.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow.

That's E-X-P-L-O, dot, C-O, slash, Lenny.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:06:34):\nThat's the first thing is that the brain has these departments and systems in it and it also has pathways. The pathways thing is really important to understand because there's a likelihood that thought will go down certain pathways in each of our brains. Some of that has to do with personality, which predisposes us to have a higher-anxiety or a lower-anxiety response or a higher-creativity or lower-creativity response. You can also be more intentional with these pathways, and that's a big component of self-awareness is to know what are my preferences and then am I actually letting those preferences take over in the situation or might be more intentional steering down the pathways to activate these best regions and systems of the brain. The simplest way to keep track of the systems is there's three, there's three really big ones.\n\n(00:07:25):\nThere probably are more than three that you can learn about, but the ones we want to have everybody learn about are your safety system, your reward system, and your purpose system. Out of those three, two of them sound really real and one of them sounds like fantasy, to most people. The safety system is pretty obvious to most people. When we're scared, afraid, uncertain, we have doubt, we're resentful, angry, apathetic, etc. This system of our brain is trying to restore our standing in the universe, like I need to get out of this stress, out of this danger, out of this anger, etc. you have an objective that, that part of your brain, that system sets, and you go chase that objective, like I want to get safe. If you're in a meeting, a practical everyday situation, and you're exposed to a statement that makes you feel unsafe, your objective now actually isn't to contribute to the meeting productively anymore.\n\n(00:08:19):\nYour brain's objective is to get back to safety. The same thing of rewards that if somebody says you'll get something, if you do this, which is the opposite of safety, that if you don't do this, something bad will happen, then yeah, your brain gets into this pursuit, desire state, which seems great and can be great in a lot of cases, but also, can be pretty narrow. When you hear people say, \"That's not my job.\" That's actually the reward system speaking, saying, \"I get rewarded for the things in this list and this thing that you're talking about is not on my reward list and I therefore am not interested in it.\" I have an easier time pushing away from it because the reward system of the brain is more transactional in a conceptual way. Then you get to this vague and ridiculous sounding purpose system.\n\n(00:09:08):\nUntil you realize what purpose is, and we've all felt it, if you understand the impact of the thing that you're doing and you understand and care about the people that are impacted by your actions, those are the conditions for purpose, and that can be really big. Like curing cancer, I understand the impact on the people, that's huge. It can also be like I'm writing an email, I understand the impact of this email and the people affected by it. You can feel purpose at this tiny little grain of sand level of your life, not just at the whole beach and shoreline level, and we teach people that, that's super important. That's the foundational layer. Then on top of that, there are a few layers that have to do with your focus because the brain can dramatically shift focus from open mindedness to deep, deep focus.\n\n(00:09:55):\nThen there's the final layer of ability, which is less science- y, less neuroscience, and more just practical that your ability is regulated by how much reality you know, like do you have the context for the decision or you just know you're supposed to make the decision? People with context have higher ability than people without. The same thing with imagination and logic that if you push those boundaries in your mind further, your ability increases almost disproportionately to how much you've pushed, so these layers just stack on. I think it's approachable, it's simple. It's like, we can all understand, is my safety reward or purpose system active right now? What is my level of focus? What level of connection with reality, reason and imagination do I have right now? Then there's your output as a human or as a team, and all these things are like levers we can pull, which is super fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\nAmazing. Just to summarize here, so we have these three systems, safety, reward, purpose, then our level of focus, and then there's the ability, are we able to actually do the job? Those are the puzzle pieces.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:11:02):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:03):\nWhere I want to take this is when we work with other people, working with other people is very hard, and some of the struggles people have at work in building product, in running a company and building teams, hiring, all these things, is they often get really frustrated by the way other people operate. Some people want to just start building a thing, some people want to really think about it. Some people are very customer qualitative, anecdote focused, some people are very metrics focused. Some people are very collaborative, want to work in groups, some people are very, I want to work alone. Just first of all, we just talked about here's how the brain works and then there's this idea of people work very differently. Can you just talk a bit about just this idea of why people behave so differently in an effort to help us learn to work better with people that are just like, \"Oh, that's so strange. This person wants to just their billing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:12:02):\nMaybe one of the worst pieces of propaganda that people walk around with in their minds is the phrase we're more similar than we are different. My theory on why we walk around with that phrase or why we're told that phrase, if we zoom in on the situations where we hear that is that we have this theory, it's easier to get along with people that are like us. If we fantasize that this person is like me, then I might get along with them better. When in fact, we should probably be building the muscle that we have the capacity to get along with people that are extremely different than we are. That fourth piece that we talk about in our coursework when we train managers, for example, is personality. We talk about your brain systems, your brain focus, your brain's ability, which sort of paints the picture that humans might be similar to each other and we can activate these things kind of unilaterally.\n\n(00:12:54):\nThen we have to drop this bomb at the end, which is, and here's why that doesn't work consistently across different types of people. I know you took our profile, our big five-based profile, and that's just one tool out of many that can help a person understand where on these various spectrum of personality traits and motivations they sit. We often use the metaphor in our training of culinary school that we're more culinary school for human performance instead of cooking class. That helps people conceptualize that I'm used to going to cooking classes in my training, here's how to do a one-on-one, here's how to offer feedback, here's a framework for generating product ideas through to prioritization and backlog. We're like, \"Well, what's going on beneath the surface? What are the underlying principles and forces at work that all the stuff that comes to life on the surface really originates from?\"\n\n(00:13:50):\nIn this culinary school metaphor, one of the things that's really important for a chef is to actually understand what are my preferences? What do I like to eat? Because if I don't know what I like, then I assume everybody else likes what I like, then I'm not going to be a very dynamic chef. I'm going to be like, \"Everybody likes lots of salt and acidity in their dishes.\" Then you're going to go to Germany and open a restaurant and be like, \"That is absolutely not what we're looking for in this cuisine.\" Self-awareness is a really important step, not just of culinary school, but for everybody. You sit somewhere on a spectrum, your brain has these pathways and these traffic cops directing traffic in your mind. You have to start with square one with yourself and understand, am I prone to try to say things politely, and so that they're received well? Or am I prone to be super blunt and direct and maybe even mean and harsh? Am I prone to sit back in conversations and let things happen, or am I prone to take over?\n\n(00:14:48):\nAm I prone to go to intellectual abstract thinking and try to deconstruct ideas or am I prone to stay very pragmatic? If you don't know who you are and you think that the universe resembles you, then you're going to get super lost in that broader spectrum. I think the big five, I mean there's a bunch of models. You have Myers-Briggs, disk, etc. They're just all imperfect ways of measuring personality, but also, useful despite the fact that they're imperfect and especially useful if you take a growth mentality instead of a justification mentality to reading them. If you say, \"okay, I'm low in politeness, I'm super direct.\" Your justification mentality of that would be like, \"Yeah, damn right. I'm awesome that everybody knows what I really mean and how I really feel.' Versus the growth thing, which is like, well, maybe there are situations where I can try a little harder than 0% to phrase things in a way that if we work backwards from the outcome, we want to choose our actions right now, would these actions so direct actually increase or reduce the probability of that outcome?\n\n(00:15:54):\nThat's when we become more dynamic chefs, more dynamic people. Personality is a broad spectrum and self-awareness is the starting point for the whole thing. The big five model gives you a really good list of attributes to scan yourself through, and then you should be making a game plan for how to do that. Then you can turn your attention to the network of humans you're a part of and say, \"Okay, well in what ways, because I'm me, am I so different than these other minds?\" How can we create a mesh mentality where thought shifts among the group to fit most naturally? In product work, especially, whether you're a founder, entrepreneur, thinking about product at that level and your team at that level, or you're in the thick of product work pushing your mind and other people's minds to get this right, then you're going to benefit a lot from understanding these traits and these differences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\nI think the big unlock here for a lot of people is that the reason you are struggling, getting something done, working with someone, being successful at your company, with your manager, with a partner in your team, is they have a very different way of their brain operating, and so they think in a very different way, they react in different ways. You may think the entire world thinks the way you do, but they don't, and these tests help you see that. To make this super concrete for people, are there a couple of examples or wins you often find that you can share of just ways to use this to become better in your job, say this week? Whether with meetings or convincing someone of something, anything along these lines?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:17:28):\nI think one more layer would be helpful to this, especially if you're a leader or a manager, which is the business world isn't just hand-to-hand combat between a bunch of individuals on the blank matrix loading screen. You're actually in a habitat as a company and your team is like a habitat. I think of companies and teams, almost like little terrariums that we're inside of, and is this terrarium set up with sand and a heat lamp and we're a bunch of frogs, like we're going to turn into frog bacon, simply because we're in this habitat? A lot of it is you want to actually create a habitat or an environment that's predisposed to high-functioning thinking and high-functioning interaction between people.\n\n(00:18:15):\nBecause if the habitat is working against all of you to begin with, then all the hand-to-hand combat that's going to show up is actually largely a function of you just being in this heat lamp, dry, devoid of life, devoid of productive ways to grapple. That's where a lot of teams and companies sit today, especially more established teams. They've either lost their way in the habitat and haven't really set the scene for good, kind of thinking and interaction, or they just never had that to begin with. Some of this stuff, like when you've talked to a couple of other people in the past, your conversation, the Canva conversation, the Figma conversation both come to mind as like it is super obvious the energy that has gone into the habitat to predispose people to high function.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):\nYou're referring to in my interviews with the folks from Figma and Canva.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:13):\nExactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\nI see. Oh, say more about that mean.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:17):\nYou think about the, even in the Canva context of coaches instead of managers. I love this, let me back up for just a second. There's a great quote, I think Dan Pink has summarized the problem better than anybody when he said, \"There's a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.\" In that gap, it says, \"Well, what is it that business is doing that science knows better?\" You can almost look at this as an equation of science knows minus what your business does equals dysfunction. That is a pretty crystal-clear thing. If you take this managers versus coaches, they're taking intuitively, I think. I don't know if they're neuroscientists, but intuitively, I think a lot of great founders understand humans don't work a certain way, and this whole paradigm of managers seems to be failing a lot. This whole paradigm, like mantra, fail faster. Seems to be failing a lot, and mission statements seem to fail a lot.\n\n(00:20:22):\nYou look at this, science knows business does as a lens to examine yourself through and stuff that fails very often is worth a look. When you look at, okay, do we really want managers, because that seems to fail a lot? Or is there a paradigm that works better for human beings that activates more human potential and hit the nail on the head? If you do the math of Canva, what science knows versus what Canva does, whether they know they're doing it scientifically right or not, the math equals zero. There's no difference between what science knows and what business does in that case. Also, the Figma conversation, I loved the phrase from that conversation, imagination is a hypothesis generation engine, I think is what the word was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\nOh, the Dylan. Yeah, the chat with Dylan.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:21:14):\nI loved that idea. Because when we talk about imagination as a part of ability, we talk about imagination's capacity to generate alternatives for you, that's its purpose. It's not just to doodle in the margins in the middle of boring meetings. That's part of it, it's a side benefit. When you look at imagination's purpose, if you have a great imagination, you always have a lot of choices in life. Mickey Mouse was a choice. It was like a new alternative way to send messages through a talking mouse. Like, that's okay, that's interesting. The other part of the hypothesis generation engine that we focus a lot on is it's not just the ability to generate choices and hypotheses, but it's also the ability to load them into your Oculus headset and walk around a world in which that choice already has been executed. That's akin to vision in a sense that do you have a really good ability to load that one branch of this imaginative tree, this one hypothesis into a simulation and then explore what the world looks like with this in place?\n\n(00:22:23):\nIf you look at this coaching thing, it's going on at Canva instead of managing, you load that in the simulator and you're like, \"Boy, this looks pretty nice. This is higher-performance thing.\" With advocacy instead of regulation, we have growth. There's a whole bunch of aspects that are inherent in that approach where science, and if you ask a neuroscientist, would that work better? They'd be like, \"Oh, hell, yeah. That would work way better.\" Because it activates this in the brain, it reduces cortisol, it does all these things that science knows work much better. There's a whole list of stuff from very deep to very tactical of things we can do differently that reduce the gap between what you're doing and what science knows and the dysfunction just shrinks and shrinks and shrinks as you do those things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\nAre there things that you've found people can change in the way they work based on the way the brain operates, whether it's run better meetings, be better influence? What are some things people can try to do this week that will make them more successful at their work or working with colleagues?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:23:32):\nIn the list of what science knows and what business does, everything is in there. Culture is in there, meetings are in there, goals are in there, deadlines are in there, team dynamics, all this stuff is in there. We'll probably just pick a few things out of that very long list. Meetings are a good one. Meetings, I forget what the statistic is, but it's some insane 12-figure amount of, no, not 12, nine-figure, no, 12-figure, hundreds of billions' amount of waste is caught in meetings. We spend gazillions of dollars on waste of time and meetings. For us, like in our programs, the average delta is between 10 and 20%. People save anywhere from a full half of a day to a full day per week of work as a result of just cleaning up the way they're using meetings. Some of that is just the design of meetings, like treat meetings like a product and treat them workflows that should be organized and used intentionally, but a lot of it is inside the meeting, like what's the tactic?\n\n(00:24:38):\nHere's something super tactical, which is, meetings, generally speaking, are a combination of priming and decision making, if you look at meetings through the lens of the phases that they are. A lot of meetings skip the priming step altogether. They launched directly into decision making. It would be safe to skip the priming step if we began the meeting under the assumption that everybody here is on the same page, has the same information, and generally speaking, intends for the same outcome. I think that's a ludicrous assumption for most meetings, and yet most people are actually shocked to find out that we're not on the same page even though we literally never have been, and as long as you're on day two plus of working together. It's a crazy thing that we don't do priming, and priming can be simple. It can even be done in the invite. One of the things that's crazy about Outlook and Google is you can put a very terrible useless meeting into Outlook and it will never look at it and be like, this is probably useless.\n\n(00:25:46):\nJust like you can go into Trello and put the dumbest project in the company's history into Trello, it will ingest anything you put into it without any discernment as to its value. Now, imagine we're going to have to do this ourselves for now until a better calendar comes out, but imagine if Outlook or Google Calendar or Cron, which now is part of Notion, would just be like, \"Uh, uh, uh. What is the point of this meeting?\" You could say, \"Okay, this is here. This meeting is about the generation of options or creative problem solving or very tactical problem solving or efficiency seeking, or what is the category of conversation we are about to have? What are some of the basic principles that should apply? Are we honoring sacred cows or are we eating sacred cows in this meeting? What is the mode mentality, the priming? How can we all say this is the mindset and the ultimate purpose that applies to the meeting?\"\n\n(00:26:52):\nYou can write that and you can read that in under three minutes. It's not some arduous process. Amazon does it in an arduous process, they're known for that. That's wisdom to know, like we need priming. They're wise enough to realize the need for it. They make that a very robust execution. It doesn't have to be that robust. Skipping priming is pretty bad. Other meetings get the priming and the decision-making backwards. We start to open the meeting. You've heard of diamond-shaped thinking, let's open the meeting with expansionary thought and let's end the second half of the meeting with convergence. Well, we start the meeting instead with convergence, realize that we can't reconcile the various party in the room, their needs for convergence.\n\n(00:27:39):\nThen you might hear in the middle of a meeting like, \"Well, let's start over again and remember why we're all here.\" We do the priming in the second half of the meeting just in time for the meeting to end. That's a super obvious thing that people can do, but that people very rarely do in priming. I'm happy to generate a list so we don't have to talk through everything, but maybe make some little PDFs or something that people can download that say, \"Here's what great priming looks like.\" Then when you move to the decision making, here's what great decision making looks like, and that way, you can have a little bit of a guide, and again, do your own math, what science knows what we're doing in this meeting. We're skipping a bunch of steps, that's growing the probability of dysfunction or things will going wrong, and let's shrink that probability instead of growing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\nAmazing. That'd be sweet if you have that. We'll definitely link to that on the show notes. The advice here is make sure when you're starting a meeting, running a meeting, prime everyone around the problem we're trying to solve or we're trying to get out of this meeting, the context, versus just diving into decision making.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:28:44):\nVery notably, the principles that apply. I think that's really, really important, not just what we're here to do, but how we can think about this best. You can even have a debate about the principles, and it's way better to have a debate about the principles than it is to have a debate about the tactics that are rooted in the fact that you have super misaligned principles. If somebody is trying to make the decision with speed in mind and another person is trying to make the decision with accuracy in mind, it is completely inevitable that they're about to have a cat fight in the meeting. It's not resolvable until they come back and revisit the fact that deeper down, we are approaching this in a completely different mentality with completely different objectives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):\nAwesome. If you end up having these PDFs of waste to prime successfully, that'd be great.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:36):\nFor sure. Will do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\nOkay, great. Other things that people can do to work with better. I know you have some advice on how to influence more effectively. I know you have some advice around strategy and vision, so maybe we go into those two directions.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:50):\nLet's start with strategy and vision, because I think it's nice to be better at strategy and vision before you start influencing people. What you'll encounter in life, in your mind, is ideas are swirling. Whether you're generating those ideas or other people are, is your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable. You can come up with your own words for that, but that's like a starting point, which is if somebody says something you've already experienced, it's something that is believed to your brain. If we said we should implement an OKR framework and you've experienced it in a prior workplace or you've read all about Google doing it, then you're going to be like, \"Yeah, we should. It would clean up a lot of junk around here. Okay, great.\" Your brain is already in a yes.\n\n(00:30:47):\nIf it's believable, maybe you're reading Harvard Business Review and you're reading about things that your business has never done, that you've never done, but there's all this evidence that it works and it makes sense to you mechanically, so you're like, \"Okay, yeah, I find that believable.\" Now we're leaning toward yes, or we're still in the yes bucket. Now we get into these unbelievable, yet maybe conceivable. These are the things that seem to be far-fetched. Going back to the Canva conversation, the conversation with Uri that you had. Most of the things that are totally believed by these leaders are unbelievable to most other leaders. We don't need managers? I don't believe it. Now we've shifted the mind from inbuilt kind of tailwind to inbuilt headwind. This is why minds struggle with strategy and with vision, is that every mind based on personality we talked about earlier, that line of demarcation between believed, we all have different lived experience, so the more experience you have, the more believed you have.\n\n(00:32:03):\nThen the believable and then the unbelievable, but yet conceivable, these lines shift a lot from person to person. An idea that totally makes sense to Uri, he's probably been in a thousand meetings where other people are like, \"That'll never work.\" Even though obviously, science knows, for example, it totally will. One of the great benefits of science in culinary school is let's not reinvent ideas that are already proven. We already know that certain things activate people's purposeful state and the full brain that seeks comprehension seats deeper problem solving, seeks human connection. Those are known things, and the same thing as the debate about the value of design sits in the strategy and vision. How do we know there's an ROI to a better design here? Well, if you could disprove that instead of proving it, because the last million people who asked this question proved it.\n\n(00:32:54):\nIf you could disprove it, you'd probably win a Nobel prize for being the first human to disprove something that is like ironclad. Like, we're done. We're done with this debate. That, I think is what we have to recognize in ourselves. Big part of self-awareness is where our unbelievable threshold begins, where our believable threshold ends. Then the inconceivable is like, get out of my office level stuff. A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem. I think it's a really, really important thing for companies and individuals to invest in themselves to kind of say, \"Do I have the capacity to recognize the situation that I find inconceivable, but that could be totally wrong?\" Then we can avoid the months potentially of arguing that sit between us and experimentation.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:34:00):\n... that sit between us and experimentation. So I think that's the starting point for that. And if we were to do paint by numbers on that, what dominoes do you want to knock down? Know your personality, what you're looking for in the Big-5 model which we lean into is openness. If you are low in openness, your brain essentially has abstract, creative, intellectual, complex thinking wired to the pain systems of the brain. That's how your wiring is. As soon as things get abstract, not only are you like, I don't like this, you have a much more visceral negative response to these types of ideas, and you are now going into your pain cave while somebody else in the room may have all that abstract, creative, exploratory thinking wired to their reward systems.\n\n(00:34:55):\nSo that's something to really know, and vulnerability is the best approach to this because if you think about the domino two, once you know this stuff, then the question is how do we socialize this knowledge in a team? Let's say it's a C suite, a leadership team, a founder and co-founder and the rest of the leadership team. And we work a lot with YC companies on this here, because it's super important. As they hire people, every incremental hire is an increment of psychological diversity, and it changes everything about how these conversations go.\n\n(00:35:27):\nSo knowing this, okay, what are our options to socialize this knowledge? Vulnerability is the best option. But Brené Brown will sell vulnerability for its own sake, not everybody buys selling vulnerability for its own sake, because it's a scary thing. But it gets a little less scary when we consider how much scarier our alternatives are. I can pretend to hide this, that's my other option, or I can not hide it, be a Tasmanian devil, and then be unapologetic. So those are your three options, and when you realize I can be vulnerable, I can attempt to hide it, or I can be unapologetic, those other two options are ruinous compared to vulnerability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):\nThe thing you said about openness and not being good at big vision, brainstorming, super resonates with me, because that's exactly me. So I took your test, what is it called? What do you call this test, by the way?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:27):\nCORE identity is what we call it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nCORE identity test.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):\nOkay, cool, and we'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:32):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):\nSo I took, it's basically the Big-5, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and formerly known as neuroticism, now called need for stability. I'm looking at it right here. And I'm actually, and I knew this about myself, I'm pretty low on openness, which I don't like to see, but it very much aligns with exactly what you said, I'm not great at big vision thinking. Like when people propose, say a designer on my team proposes this whole redesign big vision rethink of the way we, I'm like, no. It's my pain cave, like you said, and that's exactly what this test reflects.\n\n(00:37:10):\nSo I think it's a really powerful example of just understanding this is the way your brain is going to respond to things that are totally out there, inconceivable, or how would you call it? Somewhat conceivable but not necessarily believable, and that being aware that that's how your brain works is really powerful, being aware other people have a very different experience with that is very powerful. And your advice here is one, this combination of this habitat, create this habitat where you have all these versions of people's ways of thinking, where some people are in their happy cave when they're thinking big, and then along those lines, your point about vulnerably sharing, hey, this is me, I am low in openness, people need to understand this on my team, and let's work together to not let that hinder us. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:38:04):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, because if you think about these ideas as pegs in holes, we're going to take a creativity shaped peg and try to put it through a more pragmatic shaped hole, there's a translation problem there, and it's a huge burden. If the team actually needs to be innovative, it's a huge burden just in terms of time spent on that translation, to translate the visionary strategic ideas that are accurate but are inconceivable into ideas that feel believable for those who need that more grounded thing.\n\n(00:38:45):\nAnd of course the most common scenario here is ROI, which is the classic question to ask about any idea, what's the ROI? Well, if the idea is inherently generating nth order effects instead of first order effects, like what is the ROI of having fresh flowers in the lobby of a Four Seasons hotel? There's two possibilities for the Four Seasons, they either have an answer to that question which satisfies the pragmatic shaped hole, or they have said in their habitat, we don't ask those types of questions because they're a huge waste of time.\n\n(00:39:28):\nAnd if you're thinking about a competitive market, most of the people that you interview are in highly competitive markets, the team that spends less time translating satisfactory language before they move, which inevitably they'll move, and sometimes they'll move because the market forces them to. They spend so much time locked up in the ROI conversation or the justification, the translation conversation, that eventually customers start leaving, employees start leaving, and they're like, oh, okay, it's becoming more believable now. Well, because moved out of the realm of ideas into the physical world that we can see right in front of us.\n\n(00:40:05):\nAnd that team, because they got stuck in the translation phase instead of the experimentation phase, has a huge disadvantage in the market, and if you're competing head-to-head with one team, this is what I loved about the Figma conversation, that habitat inherently is built for speed because the habitat itself, words are tattooed to your brain that are like, we will not spend time in the translation phase, we will not spend much time. And we see this a lot in the interplay between finance departments, product departments, and things like that, where an overpowered CFO can start asking questions for which there are no answers, that just we're dragging the team into a different language that is much more literal than the more experiential language of the business, so you can see this play out all the time.\n\n(00:40:59):\nBut I think vulnerability is great because if you are sitting in a meeting, you Lenny, and you say, this is not my thing, basically everything you're saying is inconceivable, now I'm being honest with you, nobody's going to hate you for being honest, they're actually going to be glad that you are honest about the gap instead of glad that you are super certain that you are the right human to index off of in the decision-making process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nAnd the thing you recommend being open about is this is my personality, this is my CORE identity, I don't know the language you'd use, but it's not I think all this is inconceivable, it's I think all this is inconceivable because this is the way I think.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:41):\nAbsolutely, yeah, unpack the detail, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nGot it.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:43):\nYeah, I mean tell people, this takes my brain, all this abstract and creative future-centric thinking that's not rooted in the concrete is where my brain goes, alarms go off and I'm like, I need something concrete. So if you can give me something concrete, I'm more comfortable, but at this point I have to maybe move into a lot of trust, and trust may be my alternative to agreement, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nYeah. And there's also, I imagine, what I always do is I recognize, hey, I'm not amazing at this, let me push myself to be more open to these things and find partners that are really good at this and let them drive the ship more.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:42:26):\nYeah, and it's great, one of the things that's so cool about the YC teams that we work with is they're so sophisticated and so smart. So even though they might run into this roadblock, A, they're going to do exactly what you just said and they're going to push themselves. You may notice in your profile the dot that you scored is surrounded by rings that represent how hard it is for you to push yourself to think in different ways, to think beyond the home base way of your brain working.\n\n(00:42:55):\nNow at a certain point your brain breaks and you move into foreign territory, and there's a level of, I mean, if you are a very conservative person and somebody's like, \"Let's go to Burning Man,\" that will break your brain. You don't go all the way to the other side of the spectrum necessarily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):\nFor the record, I've been four times, even though I'm apparently low in openness.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:17):\nPerfect, and there's lots of reasons to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):\nGot married at Burning Man. Makes me feel better about my low percentile.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:25):\nBut you're pushing your brain. I mean, Burning Man's actually a great example because there are a bunch of different reasons you might go. And if you go for one reason, then you're exposed to the other reasons. And that may be interesting, and you may kind of venture closer to those other reasons. You may be like, I'm going to stay in my reason bubble within the greater context of this place.\n\n(00:43:44):\nSo there's a whole bunch of... And business is no different, you can say, okay, I'm going to push myself, and I may get into these places that go beyond my brain's flexibility, where the elastic band reaches its limits, and then from there I'll trust people and I'll have people, what I was going to mention about the YC founders is so many of them are so smart that they're really able to efficiently translate what they see beyond where your band stretches into the language you feel comfortable with, quickly. Other teams do that really badly and they just accuse you of, \"Why can't you see this?\" And then you get even more stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nHow much shift have you seen in people, say they take this test and they're like, as I am, 23rd percentile in openness, do you see people move meaningfully across this if they work on these sorts of things, or is this just like, here's who you are, you're not going to change significantly?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:44:41):\nPersonally I'm more concerned with the effect on teams than on people, because if you look at this through the... I've been a four time founder, and if I look at this through how is my company working? How are my teams working? I don't need all the individuals to get to perfect, I need, especially in cases where there's this translation issue where a team is working on something and some part of that team is saying, \"Let's stop here and let's dwell here.\" If they can move enough that the team, the effect on the team is now freed up, that's what we really feel as a business.\n\n(00:45:23):\nSo to answer your question directly, people can move a lot, especially through the first three rings of that range that we depict, really, really well. Self-awareness is actually kind of the key, and self-awareness and self-consciousness, the difference here is that self-awareness is simply being intentional with your brain, whereas self-consciousness is being worried about your brain. We don't want people to be worried about their brains and insecure, we just want you to say, this is a situation in which my brain can work this way, and this is a situation where I want to push myself.\n\n(00:45:56):\nSo it's being intentional, and we talked a little bit before this episode about this instinct versus intellect duality in the mind, and essentially you're just using your intellect to either verify or improve your instinct. You're always going to have instinctive responses about risk and fear and uncertainty and doubt and need for data, and all these types of things, but then your intellect can come in and watch that part of your brain thinking and say, you're super worried about the risk of this, but it's actually pretty low stakes for us to jump in and try. So your need to stabilize that is a little misplaced, and your intellect, that's really what you're doing is saying, how much do people change? I don't really worry too much about how much they change, it's more about how much they can spot with their intellect something that's misfit to the situation, and then take what they're motivated to do, and what they choose to do, and separate them. It doesn't matter if we change your motivations, if your choice of behavior and your underlying motivation can be different from each other, that's awesome, those people are super. And we all know people like that, where you're like, I know this person is uncomfortable right now, but they're totally making it work, and I really appreciate that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):\nYeah, part of the reason I ask is, I was talking to you about this before we started recording, I want 99th percentile at all these, I just want to nail this. And I know that's not how it works, I know you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can't be amazing at everything. But that's funny my mind goes there.\n\n(00:47:28):\nJust to close the loop on this advice around getting better at vision and strategy, if I were to reflect back what I'm hearing its be very self-aware about what you are not strong at, say openness. Is that specifically the one to focus on if you're trying to figure out how to get better vision and strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:47:46):\nSo there's a whole bunch of stuff... Well, let me try to make the list simple. Openness is the biggest one because it is essentially your tolerance of vision and strategy, and the lower that is, the lower you will tolerate the abstract pieces of the puzzle, for sure. The outlandish and purely creative and rules-breaking components of strategy and vision, lack of precedence, those types of things. Now the other thing to look out for is as your conscientiousness rises, which is essentially your desire to be efficient, effective, busy, not waste time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):\nI'm high on that one.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:48:25):\nYeah, structured and organized, that is another contributor in the negative, which is it's objectively great to be a conscientious person, there are so many benefits, until we have to waste time productively, or we have to break order in organization. And then that strength that four days a week, or 28 days a month is great for you, on those days where we go and have the offsite and say, what if we blew it all up, to your example of new design, new website, blow it all up, start over again, different direction, that's where the conscientiousness is going to be like, why are we doing this? Why are we having this conversation? What's the need? This is inefficient, I could be spending my time doing something else.\n\n(00:49:09):\nAnd sometimes that'll express itself even in meetings of, I was in a meeting one time after we were acquired, this was eight or nine years ago now, and when you're a founder and you get acquired, there's a new flavor of habitat that you find yourself in with very new rituals. And one of the rituals that I find myself around a lot was the ritual of saying, we can't talk about this for the rest of our lives. And we would be about six minutes into a meeting when somebody would drop the, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives\" line, and I would look at my watch and be like, \"I didn't realize that you were terminal, I mean, why are you even in this meeting if you're about to die?\"\n\n(00:49:53):\nBecause my take on this is we are super far away from the rest of our lives right now, why are you saying that we can't talk about something for six minutes when the diminishing return of added information in the priming of this meeting, to use that again, you knowing X quadruples your decision quality, and you are resisting knowing X. Now we're going to hit a point where you knowing Y, Z, etc, we've hit a diminishing return and now I'm improving your decision quality by 1% instead of by 4x. But we haven't established any sensitivity in this room to the diminishing return curve of incremental thought and incremental information. And this is like a new habitat, I'm like, in this habitat do people really hate thought? Do people really consider themselves to be the police that watch the mean streets of intellectualism for any activity? It's just kind of crazy. But yeah, that's kind of the practical side of this, is you got to watch out and you got to be careful, and that's why I habitat is such a big deal because that's a perfect example of a well-intentioned room with mostly people that are there for the right reasons and the right outcomes, but where this normalness of saying a phrase like that, or saying, \"I disagree.\" Same meeting person goes, \"I completely disagree,\" and I was like, \"With everything?\" \"Absolutely everything.\" And I go, so let's look at the meta, the overhead camera of this meeting.\n\n(00:51:33):\nThis was the initiation of combat, that's what the brain is seeing. All the brains in the room are like, oh, fight, right? And now what are our objectives? My objective now becomes win, their objective, because they've taken a huge risk of saying, I disagree with everything, becomes win, and because they are disagreeing with a lot of stuff that they don't understand, the inevitability is they're about to be annihilated in this room where they have both said, we can't talk about this forever, and now put all of their chips onto the table to say, \"I completely disagree,\" instead of, \"I have a question,\" or, \"Can we pull that thread?\" Or, \"I don't see how these dots connect.\"\n\n(00:52:15):\nSo that on a super tactical level, there's things we say that activate the amygdala, the combat mode of the brain, versus a different choice of phrase which is going to activate the prefrontal cortex which is like, \"Hey Lenny, you're connecting these two dots, I'm not seeing how they're connected,\" logic, now let's activate the prefrontal cortex with this sentence instead of, \"Lenny, that's dumb, I completely disagree,\" let's activate the amygdala instead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):\nI want to talk about this habitat point you're making which I think is really important, but just to close the loop on the strategy vision piece, so just to give people some very tactical advice is, basically understand your personality, maybe take this CORE identity test, or something like that, understand if you're low in openness and high-end conscientiousness, maybe you're not amazing at vision and it's going to be hard for you to think big and think of it-\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:53:06):\nYeah, your brain is just going to feel agitated when you're around vision. But, I mean, you can still do it, right? You can still ask people to translate. The key tactic is, okay, it's not this you're predestined to suck, it's more if you're low and openness, especially if you're also high in conscientiousness, then recognize your native language for ideas is a mismatch for the native language of vision and really, really good strategy.\n\n(00:53:35):\nAnd then you can be open about that and you can ask for some translations, and you can ask for... I mean, trust doesn't have to be non-participation, you can actually say, it would help me trust if you could explain this gap. A great example would be a second order effect, why should we have awesome documentation? How are we going to make more money if we have awesome documentation? Great question, don't be hostile in the way you asked it, but just help me understand, what thread are we pulling? Well, we're pulling this thread of customer satisfaction, retention, recommendation, et cetera, Stripe is really good at this, especially from the early days, that great documentation justifies all sorts of second order effects that then will lead us to this first order effect you're asking about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:20):\nAwesome, okay, that's really great. And I was going to go one direction, but I want to talk about this real quick. Something that comes up a lot on this podcast is the power of leaning into strengths and not feeling like you have to be amazing at everything, and that in this example, I have a low openness, high conscientiousness, I can still be very successful in the role by, in my opinion, leaning into things I'm actually really strong at, say conscientiousness, and I'm also high in agreeableness. I don't like the sound of that. Thoughts on just, it's okay if you're not amazing at vision because your openness is low, but you can be better at other stuff and together you can be really successful no matter how your personality.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:55:03):\nAbsolutely right, yeah. I mean, the truth is we look at, taking that Canva example of coaches and managers, not only does that change the way an employee feels about the way this connection they have is invested in them, but it also changes inherently a lot of the meeting dynamics and teaming dynamics from hierarchical feeling things manager to more mesh based intellect. And within the mesh, you don't have to worry too much about the hierarchy anymore. You can say, this is the nature of my contribution.\n\n(00:55:39):\nSo even in the vision and strategy piece, maybe your contributions to idea generation, there are going to be some, and they're probably going to be good. But those are not ideas to protect in the state that you brought them to the table, they're ideas to set on the table so that people can surround them and improve them. And then as other people contribute ideas that aren't as natural to you, kind of just realize we're not in the phase yet of judging and ranking and prioritizing these ideas, that's not where we are in the overall storyline. So let it happen, and then if you can improve those ideas, improve them.\n\n(00:56:15):\nAnd once ideas have that early stage, that kind of like what Jony Ive described as the infancy of an idea, when it's really weak and delicate and susceptible, if you can nurture that idea to adolescence where it has a little bit of ability to defend itself, then now you're in a situation where your conscientiousness can start to think about things like how would we resource this? What sequencing makes the most sense? What is the ROI of these things relative to each other? And consider the second and third order effects, and so on. And what would the project plans, and to your point of being both conscientious and agreeable, you are this master of coordination and alignment naturally.\n\n(00:56:56):\nSo when that phase of the project begins and we have to get people bought in, high functioning together, getting on the same page, staying focused, getting the project done, all of the people that were good at the beginning with all the vision and strategy, they are just a complete disaster in that phase. That's just how things really work in the real world, and I think we're so, again, focused, like we talked about at the beginning, we alluded to the fact you have to unpack enough complexity. I love the Einstein quote, \" Make things as simple as possible but no simpler,\" and we've made things way simpler than possible in business by saying this is the right way of doing the whole thing.\n\n(00:57:41):\nIt's like, no, no, no, if you've ever lived a day in real life, building a real product, the dynamics shift a lot throughout the course of product life cycle, as an example, or really any life cycle as an example. And the peak humans as the dynamics shift are very different, peak humans. Lenny is awesome here, contributes here 10%, contributes here 98%. Evan contributes 98% here, please get Evan out of the room when it comes to these meetings, that's great. And yes, we should lean into our strengths, but not so much that we don't know our weaknesses, because another human strength on your team is the patch for the bug of your weakness. And we run buggy software in companies and we say, \"Oh, I am leaning into my strengths, I don't need to worry about my weaknesses,\" well, then you become the person who needs everything translated into your language because when your weakness flares its head up, it slows everybody else down.\n\n(00:58:41):\nSo it's really, just from an operations business fluidity perspective, a team that is highly unaware of its weaknesses is going to have a lot of slowness and a lot of problems as a result of that. They don't have to fix all their weaknesses, but be aware of them and know who is a patch to your weakness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nEvan, this is so interesting. I love that we're digging deep on this. Is there one tactical thing you could recommend for someone to become better at openness in, say, a brainstorming experience when they're doing vision, or when they're low at this, say me.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:59:13):\nI think the best exercise for a conscientious person especially to feel more open is to become obsessed with reverse engineering. And it's to say, there's two forms of reverse engineering that I think are really helpful here. Number one would be reverse engineering against a desired outcome, to truly understand the inputs that generate that outcome. And if we think about that at a big level, like, okay, we want to win a market, what are the real inputs to deconstruct that outcome and understand what our strategy should look like to attack all of the most relevant inputs that generate that outcome? I think that's the specific form.\n\n(00:59:55):\nAnd then at a super tactical level, if you want to give feedback to somebody, and let's say, for me, I'm low in politeness, you're probably much higher in politeness than I am, and I struggled for years with feedback to generate the intended outcome. I delivered the feedback, but the delivery wasn't the intended outcome, and the way that I delivered it actually reduced the probability of the intended outcome because I was being too impolite, too direct in many cases, too harsh. And what does harshness do to the brain? Well, that's crystal clear. So what I was doing and what science knows were very different things, and that's why I failed in those cases.\n\n(01:00:35):\nBut as soon as I started closing the gap and realized I need to try harder to think about the story arc of this feedback, that becomes clearest to me how to do it when I have the intended outcome in mind for the feedback, I really would like this person to start turning the corner on this particular way of thinking. If you and I worked together and it was about openness, we'd be like, what are some things that I could do right now to increment and set the stage for a big shift in openness as time goes on that you are bought into? And that's a very, if I'm impolite and be like, \"Lenny, what's your problem? Why can't you do this? Everybody else can do this.\"\n\n(01:01:13):\nYour willingness to start turning that corner, I mean, it may be there, the safety system is activated, like, oh, bad things could happen if I don't do this, but I don't want your safety system to motivate this change.I mean, in most cases, that's an optics based change instead of a material change that will occur. And that's why a lot of people, accountability is a great example, asking for accountability is the best way to not get it, because asking for accountability activates people's safety systems, or especially saying, \"I'm going to hold people accountable.\" Then everybody's like, oh, great, we should set up a whole movie set of facade houses that pretend everything's great with no substance behind them, and that's why so many companies end up that way. But yeah, I would say that's the tactical.\n\n(01:01:58):\nThe second thing to understand about openness and reverse engineering is just situational awareness. Very few conscientious people spend, in my opinion, as a very open person, enough time immersing themselves in the reality that is every day situational awareness necessary to do their job. Simplest example of this is how many executives have ever talked to N greater than five customers? That is a... Because, well, I'm busy. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't have time to go take a world tour, which is like we don't have the rest of our lives to talk about this. I'm not asking you to take a world tour, I'm asking you to stuff into your brain enough situational awareness that the decisions you make every day that affect all those people you're not talking to are considering those people that you're not talking to.\n\n(01:02:49):\nSo less about an intended specific outcome in this case, and more about, do I really know the... I would think about this as if we think about aeronautical engineering, do I actually have an understanding of the conditions, the flight conditions, that I'm in every day in order to fly really well? And the answer to that for a lot of people is no. So reverse engineering is probably the whole category. I don't know if that makes enough tactical sense, I'm happy to be more descriptive, but that's the category I think is have you reversed engineered how to get outcomes and have you reversed engineered to predispose your mind to come up with really good ideas and good decisions, as opposed to come up with decisions that are super disconnected from reality.\n\n(01:03:37):\nGreat example being PLG, I mean, if you haven't done enough situational awareness work, you have no idea if PLG is a remotely viable strategy for growing your business. If it's remotely relevant strategy for growing your business. And company after company after company has leadership team obsessed with this concept that in principle we should be able to let people just sign up and swipe a credit card and onboard and great. No, we have a hyper technical solution, that is never going to happen, or that's not the way they do budget, or there could be any number of ways that that's not going to work out, and those are just some concrete examples.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(01:04:49):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

That's geteppo.com/Lenny.\n\n(01:05:38):\nIt feels like there's a fractal of stuff we could talk about and endless threads of things that I want to dig into. Let me shift a little bit to influence, we mentioned this a little bit earlier. I know you have a bunch of awesome advice on how to build your skill at becoming more influential, that's something a lot of listeners of the podcast, or product managers, also founders, need the skill. Who doesn't need to become better influencers? What can we learn about how to become better influencers?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:06:05):\nWe'll probably unpack a second topic and open up an off ramp here right at the beginning, but there's two things, there's influence itself and then there's relationships, and we should probably talk a little bit about relationships. Trying to exert influence through a dysfunctional relationship is not going to go great. And most human beings, especially when they go to work, are pretty out of sorts when it comes to relationships.\n\n(01:06:36):\nAnd you even hear crazy mantra like we have to each other to work together, which are like, good luck with that. I mean, just watch a text message pop up on a phone of a person who doesn't like you and watch their response time to the text message, or their Slack message, or whatever. I mean, you're talking about you've built in a multi-day, at least multi-hour delay into responsiveness purely because the relationship isn't good, and then you compound that effect over whatever size your company is. That's massive operational inefficiency just because I don't want to respond to Evan right now. So that's the one piece.\n\n(01:07:19):\nNow assuming the relationship is in place, and we'll come back to that and talk about that because a whole very actionable framework to unpack, assuming the relationship is good, I think the starting point for influence is to choose your character and choose your mode. It's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game, and you're going to be like, am I going to influence him this way as the hero or the exemplar of these things, or am I going to influence through back channels, what is my character? And everybody for your personality has a natural fit for the character you're going to select as this mode of influence, and then you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:08:00):\nThen you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast. The habitat can help a lot with this. If a founder is listening to this and you haven't created a habitat where fast influence is easy and the permission isn't there, then you're slowing the company down inadvertently by just not clarifying this with the team. So slow influence is the we'll let them find out the hard way influence. They're going off a cliff, we know they're going off a cliff. And a lot of times we find ourselves in what's called the Abilene paradox.\n\n(01:08:39):\nThe Abilene paradox is where everybody in the room knows it's a bad idea, but we're all like \"We're in.\" And the classic Abilene paradox kind of if you look up memes on Google, it'll be like the dad thinks that the kids might want to go camping. Mom doesn't want to go camping, the kids don't want to go camping. Dad also doesn't really want to go camping, but everybody's like, \"Dad probably wants us to go camping, so let's give it a go.\" And they all go and don't enjoy it. And we see that play out all the time.\n\n(01:09:09):\nAnd a lot of people will just say, \"I can't do anything. I don't have any influence in this case. We're just going to let him fail and they'll learn.\" Or this impolite person like me giving feedback the wrong way years in the past, I'm not going to sit Evan down and talk to him about this. He'll figure out on his own through failure that this doesn't work. And that can take months, that can take years, that can take a lifetime for people to learn the slow way. And it is a form of influence. You are being intentional to say, I think the world will create enough failure that adaptation will occur. That is a form of influence, just the slowest one.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd a lot of people listening probably realize, \"Oh, that's what I'm doing. How can I go way faster than just letting things fail?\" So that's where moderate influence comes in. And a great book to read for a moderate influence is the Challenger Sale. And in the Challenger Sale, what we're looking at is the concept of teaching people something. And then when they live with this new knowledge, they'll see things that they weren't seeing before. So for example, in the feedback example that we can keep using over and over again through this is, \"Hey Evan, you might want to notice people's body language while you're saying these things and here's some signs to look out for that when you've done this and you get this, that's probably a sign that people are bought in and still with you. And when you see this, that's probably a sign that people are pushing back.\"\n\n(01:10:37):\nAnd you can ask this question in that moment and you'll probably hear answers like this. So you're like giving somebody a tool that their future is going to unpack. And the Challenger Sale kind of assumes a long enough sales cycle where you're not going to land the sale in the meeting, you're not trying to close them right there. You'll teach them some stuff and you'll, \"Hey, if you see this stuff, that's a pretty clear sign that you need to take action. So why don't we call you in 30 days, and 30 days later we get on phone, \"Hey, have you been seeing this?\" And they'll go, \"Everywhere I look, I can't not see it now.\"\n\n(01:11:13):\nAnd that's how you influence a person in a few days, a few weeks, maybe a few months at worst, way faster than letting them fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\nWe actually had, I don't know if you know this, we had the author of that book on the podcast, Matt Dixon, I think his name. And the Challenger Sale, the idea there is challenge their perspective and view on what is actually real about the market and what they need.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:11:36):\nExactly. Yeah. I think yes, there's the challenge component to it, but I think the underappreciated piece of that methodology is that you're still letting that person see the world, but you've given them new information that is breaking some calcification in their brain challenge. It's not the moment of the challenge where all the magic happens. There's moments that occur later that continue kind of putting that calcium, lime and rust melting formula on this expectation or this kind of decision in their mind to the point where sometimes they'll turn around and be like, \"Thank you for even telling me this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\nSo the advice here is if you're trying to influence someone, try to figure out what they don't know. Find information that you know they may not know because once they know that and they may be like, \"Oh wow, I totally see what you're saying.\"\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:12:33):\nYeah, exactly right. And let them know it and let them live with it. Don't cram it down their throat and make them accept it If they live with it just a little bit, even just a couple days, that might be enough to come back to a much softer conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\nDoes this connect to what you said earlier, which I love this idea of pick a character, like pick your influence style based on your personality, whether it's back channeling and that makes me think of a very specific person. He's coming on the podcast actually, he's this Jedi that just gets people aligned but very behind the scenes, very the meetings before the meetings. So that's one character or it's just telling a compelling story probably in a deck. Or there's other character I guess. Does this idea of sharing information, is that a type of character or is that just something that everyone should just do because a really effective strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:13:27):\nI like the idea of intentionality in just about everything. Are we letting trade winds push us into certain things or are we actually making choices? And I think that step of being intentional about your style and this kind of notion of a character is a wise step to take so that you can kind of have some guardrails as you go through this and some consistency. It helps other people understand the role you're playing in influence. If you are consistently coming from the same place, you're about that style, like I want to try to influence this organization by doing this way and you're going to see that from me over and over and over again.\n\n(01:14:07):\nYou kind of have given yourself a little permission and also you can get some buy-in from people. If you do want be more the barbarian kind of approach, you can say, \"Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy.\" Is it okay if I do that over and over and over again? And now you've bought future you the permission to approach things in certain ways that would yield meaningfully different influence outcomes, like meaningfully different. I was able to do this and it accelerated something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nSo the way I am hearing this is there are many ways to get what you want, think about your personality style and find the path that is most aligned with the way you operate.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:14:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):\nWhether it's behind the scenes, whether it's a compelling story. Awesome. So this character is basically figure out what your... It kind of comes back to leverage your strengths, what are you good at? And use that channel to convince people of the thing you want them to be convinced of.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:08):\nYep, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):\nMy mind goes to what are the list of ways, what are the character options in this list when I'm opening up the game and choosing? You went through a few, but just to give people like, oh, okay, I see I could try it this way. Is there a small list you could share of just like here's ways you could try approaching influence.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:27):\nProbably the dimensions are most valuable to people. I would say one of the dimensions is compassion, which is do I want to influence by trying to help people, by trying to make sure that we get it right and that people get value. And then the permission I'm seeking there is can I ask questions about why are we not thinking about the user right now? Why are we not concerned with the value they're getting and challenge us in that way?\n\n(01:15:59):\nI think there are characters based on logic and even belief, which is I would like to be the one to insert more knowledge and insert more causality into conversations and challenge causality in conversations to make us think harder and challenge what we believe and break up the sacred cows of the stuff we walked in the meeting with so that we feel differently about things walking out of meetings.\n\n(01:16:27):\nSo I think there's a bunch of different very useful dimensions. One could be very creativity based. If you follow this big five format, they're kind of spelled out for you. Enthusiasm, interesting dimension. I want to challenge us through the lens of what do people get excited about? What makes people feel good? Does this make people feel good? And are there tweaks we could make to the product or this marketing campaign or whatever.\n\n(01:16:54):\nLook at what Siki just did with Runway. I mean I love that guy so much and there's so many components of his character and obviously the characters he surrounded himself with that contribute to really next level stuff. And they're definitely challenging each other using these dimensions of compassion to be the character of caregiver or the character of protector. And so there's a bunch of different ways you could turn those dimensions into characters.\n\n(01:17:28):\nBut I think when you see the value of each of those perspectives, especially in product, I'm a really big fan of product. If you have dysfunctionally high compassion, dysfunctionally high openness, you have internal rewards and motivations to explore regions of product that other minds aren't exploring as intuitively. And you don't have to have the whole deck to be amazing at product. But you have some unfair advantages if you are super prone to reverse engineering just by your nature. You are going to be more situationally aware and probably make a series of vastly better decisions than the team that has a lot less situational awareness than you do. It's a huge advantage.\n\n(01:18:16):\nBut when it comes to the concept of influence. I mean figuring out these dimensions that define who you are and then using them to kind of say, \"I want the permission to ask a series of questions and challenge our thinking through this very intuitive strength that I have.\" Can we all see the value in that or do I need to further sell myself? And then you'll find you can take on that character and play that role really well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\nI imagine the ultimate unlock is that combined with what is that person's personality style and what is the best way they receive information, which is a little harder. Because you can't force them to take some tests and you can't make them give you the results. But I know a lot of teams do these tests together as a team and share the results. And so it's I guess a reminder of just that's really powerful if you and your team, especially the execs at company.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:19:09):\nYeah, exactly. And when you move into this vulnerability out of your three choices state, we don't need a bunch of data for that to work really well. If you said, \"Hey, I'm not super strong at this,\" and the rest of the room was like, well \"Wait, this other person's super awesome at this, why don't not the two of you work together,\" then it's like under 30 seconds we've unlocked potential that wasn't there.\n\n(01:19:34):\nSo you want to get business.... I kind of think of extending the video game metaphor. Not only are we choosing our characters or we are a certain character, but the business has a difficulty setting that we chose based on the habitat. And I've worked in and with way too many companies where we are playing the game in nightmare and every enemy takes a thousand shotgun shells to bring down instead of just switching the difficulty setting to easy, which is like the enemies somehow become our friends as we go through this journey.\n\n(01:20:06):\nI mean, it really can be that transformative, especially with a case like yours that you talked about. Okay, I am not as high in openness. I'm very high in conscientiousness. If I can admit this and ask different types of questions, everybody else in the room will be like the difficulty setting of this just went to zero and the speed of it just went to way higher than it used to be.\n\n(01:20:32):\nAnd we underestimate this kind of less concrete part of the business world. And I mean that's the genesis of this whole business that I was crazy enough to start after starting other companies in the past, which is like we are underestimating how much of our operational reality is a function of our human reality. And are we doing enough? Are we doing the right things to close the gap between what science knows and what business does? And do we even know what the science is? Have we educated ourselves to close the gap? And then it becomes super obvious, oh, this makes a lot of sense to be open and find the patch to my bug. And here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nThis fractal of topics continues to grow. I'm trying to contain it. There's three things I want to try to talk about in the rest of our chat, that stuff we've touched on that I think will be really useful to people. One is relationships. You mentioned there's more to talk about there just how to build great relationships. Two is I want to come back to the habitat and building a habitat that is very conducive to innovation and speed and success and those sorts of things. And then I want to talk about focus. We talked a bit about just how important focus is and how differently our brains operate in different states of focus. So maybe we start with the relationship piece just because that connects to what we were just talking about of how do we strengthen relationships, create better relationships within our teams.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:21:53):\nYeah, so we were talking about relationships kind of as this off ramp or this kind of sidecar to influence. And real quickly the fast mode of influence and relationships goes really well together. So we talked about the slow and the moderate. The fast mode of influence is cognitive dissonance. It's essentially saying in the moment, I'm not going to wait for you to experience anything. It's saying in the moment, how does this formula compute? Explain to me, Evan, how you being too blunt in feedback is going to end up in a human being changing. Why do you believe that?\n\n(01:22:29):\nAnd especially it's that second phrase of why do you believe that drill below the behavior down into the belief. What do you believe that has you doing this? And then we can explore how preposterous the belief itself is, which then bubbles up to the surface level of this.\n\n(01:22:47):\nAnd if in the environment, the habitat's a huge component of this as our relationships, which is if you have great relationships where people trust each other enough to have this kind of cognitive dissonance conversation, and we have a habitat that is very clear that we are free to discuss cognitive dissonance and logical disconnects, that is really important to do. Then you activate fast influence mode basically. So that's a really important thing. And then as you transition to relationships, well what are... The question that everybody kind of glosses over in my opinion is what is a relationship? I don't know how you feel about answering that question, but it's a really hard-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nI would just go to ChatGPT. What is a relationship?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:23:33):\nExactly, right. Yeah. At this point we have some help that we didn't use to have. But the other thing that goes along with what is a relationship is how good is my relationship with person X? Like, you and I both know Shreyas and how good is our relationship? I would say it's awesome. Why is it awesome? I don't know. It just feels great. So let's double click on a good definition and a good framework because once you actually know why a relationship feels great, that example or why a relationship feels super difficult, now we can start to build some strategies, some actual action plans for them.\n\n(01:24:14):\nSo what we propose to people is if you take that third component of your brain ability, that is one piece of your relationships, especially your professional relationships. So if you know an engineer and you have an idea of something you want to build and they have the ability to build it, their ability and their utility to you is a function of your relationship and it will contribute to the positive or negative force that you feel in that relationship. Like, wow, this person has a lot of ability. My appreciation is higher, my faith in them is higher, my cooperation with them is higher.\n\n(01:24:50):\nIf you question a person's ability or they've proven that ability is kind of unreliable, those things start to kind of vector downwards and we will pick on Shreyas through this as a good example? Because I think most of the people watching also know him. What is his ability? What is his utility? As high as I've ever seen. I mean every conversation he's intellectually conceptually additive to. You're better after you've talked to him every time. At least that's been my experience with him.\n\n(01:25:20):\nAnd we all know people like that, with various fields and various abilities. So that's one piece that's really important. And why as an individual, it's so important to invest in your ability because it is so integral to every relationship you have, particularly professional relationships and your ability, knowledge, your reasoning, your imagination, your skill set, these are all incrementable facets of you.\n\n(01:25:50):\nAnd that's really, really key. Now here's the plot twist. Your ability is actually not the most important part of a relationship, biologically speaking. There's two more that matter quite a bit more. And the surprise ending is that the third one matters the most, which is scary in some cases.\n\n(01:26:11):\nThe second factor of relationships is trust. So trust in the brain. If we go very primitive back to the amygdala that we talked about earlier, trust is simply risk. Human level risk and trust can span from strongly negative to strongly positive in a relationship. And we felt that full range with different people in our lives. Strongly negative trust is the brain saying, this person is dangerous to me. They're very likely to try to undermine me. They're very likely to not deliver something. Personal harm will occur by essentially kind of interacting in this relationship.\n\n(01:26:51):\nAnd then on the other side of trust, we kind of try to create some levels to this to keep it clean. And the fractal continues to grow a little bit, but we'll try to keep this simple. But I like to think of trust one, two and three. Three distinct levels of trust. And trust one is, let's say we're having a cookout. Trust one is Lenny, could you please bring the chips, ideally sealed, but it's a delegation of a simple non-critical task knowing that it is likely to get done and get done decently well. But it's not like this huge level of trust. It's the people that we work with where this type of delegation, and especially if people delegate under the thesis of \"I want to do the high value work, so let me put the low value work on other people.\" That's all the low value work that we put on other people, and it allows us to purify our focus on the high value work, and we don't need all the low value work to go beautifully well or be artistically brilliant.\n\n(01:27:53):\nSo trust two is when we step up to almost like \"I need to do this myself. Is there anybody who could do it as well as me?\" That there's no risk to me having them do it instead of me doing it. And that's where you get true scalability of teams. So if you can trust people enough, your brain's assessment of risk of giving this task to someone else or giving this knowledge even to somebody else, that they'll treat it the way you would treat it, is a significantly higher positive trust that you can feel in a relationship.\n\n(01:28:26):\nAnd then finally, trust three is when we do hit these breakpoints in our brain where we say the way your mind works is beyond the way my mind works on this topic. So the classic example at the cookout would be if Wolfgang Puck was a neighbor, we're going to have Wolfgang Puck do all the most critical stuff and maybe even set up the music and the decor and whatever. Or another example would be like when Steven Spielberg has John Williams score a film, he's not hoping John will do it as well as Steven would do it. He's saying, \"Just send me the bill. Try not to go too crazy.\" But he is not going to sit down with the invoice and be like, \"Why did you need 13 horns instead of 11?\" John just gets to do what John does because there's so much trust in this kind of beyond my event horizon kind of risk. It would be riskier for me to do it than for him to do it or her to do it, right?\n\n(01:29:25):\nSo that's kind of the level, but that matters more to a human being because the safety system, if it activates, your utility is sunk. So if you're an awesome engineer but you damage people, it doesn't matter that you're an awesome engineer because in the social network, the mesh of your organization, you are a node that has a protective covering around it. Information is not flowing to you the way it would normally, and delegation is not flowing to you and access is not flowing to you the way it would normally. So you are a kind of protected, deactivated, sequestered node of the mesh at this point in time. And a lot of people really don't get that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nYeah, that's a really good way of visualizing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:30:16):\nAnd then here's the surprise ending. The last piece of every relationship that you have is appeal. Appeal is how your brain interprets the shared experiences you have with other people. Whether or not you look forward to being around that person, whether or not you like their style, the feel of what shared experiences really are. And if you think about, let's pick on Shreyas one last time. What is his ability and utility? Off the charts. To what extent can he be trusted? Trust three, off the charts. Will he ever damage somebody? I mean, not to my knowledge. He may have some really dark past that we don't know about, but as far as I've seen, not a lot of damage in his wake. And then thirdly, what kind of experience is he? He's an extraordinarily positive experience. So he naturally accumulates great relationship after great relationship after great relationship.\n\n(01:31:15):\nAnd again, if you're that great engineer with a ton of ability, now let's flip the middle dimension. And we trust you a lot, but you're a horrible experience. Are you coming to our offsite? Are you in this meeting? No, you're gone. We don't want you there. You're like a hurricane. So biologically speaking, the biggest bug in our programming as we transfer this to the business context is what makes the most sense in business is the most, if it's a meritocracy, the best people with the best knowledge that we can trust should be in the room and we will fight it with every fiber of our being if they're a terrible experience. And that's a bummer. And what's funny is you can flip it. We all either have friends or know people who have friends that you cannot trust, they have no ability to speak of, but they're a super awesome experience. What a great friend.\n\n(01:32:16):\nSo how is it that we get this thing completely flipped? And I think that's the thing. As you parse that list, as anybody listening parses that list, it's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? That is where to start? Not how good am I at my job? How much do I know? How critical am I to this process? But am I a miserable experience? And if the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet, you got to fix that first.\n\n(01:32:48):\nAnd to this point of the profile, as you parse the profile, you'll find things like obviously not a pleasant experience, like being really impolite, obviously not a pleasant experience, being super overbearing and assertive, obviously not a pleasant experience, being hyper low in openness and enacting out of that and telling everybody they're overcomplicating everything all the time. Not a great experience for people who are actually well-intentioned trying to get it right. So there's concrete things that you can do with this knowledge in mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\nThis last piece makes me think about why some of the most effective PMs are the PMs that bring a lot of energy and positivity to the team and just get people excited, which is such a soft skill, but such a powerful thing you can do for your team because people kind of look to you to lead them. I had a PM I was working with in every meeting, he is like, \"This is going to be awesome.\" He just comes right in every meeting, \"Oh, who's ready to make some decisions,\" and it really changes everything. And so this is amazing advice.\n\n(01:33:46):\nSo basically if you want better relationships, which will make you a better influencer, start with what kind of experience am I, when people work with me, ask me for stuff, ask me questions, and you shared a bunch of specific things you can do.\n\n(01:34:03):\nSomething I always tell people is just try to smile, just look happy. That makes a big difference.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:07):\nLook happy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):\nBring energy, look happy. Just try to be excited. Yeah, so if you want to build better relationships which have all these amazing trickle down effects, your advice is think about the experience you are to other people when they work with you, work on trust and ideally get to the place that third level of you are doing it better than them. But that's a high bar for all things. And then the last thing is, are you actually amazing? Work in your abilities, that's kind of the last piece.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:38):\nYeah, exactly. And it's not that none of these become unimportant because the other are kind of the gateways. I mean your relationships require all three, especially your professional relationships. So yeah, it's more just like if experience is the only thing undermining you when you're otherwise very trustworthy and very skilled and able, that's a shame. Just fix it.\n\n(01:35:03):\nAnd there's a whole bunch of ways to go about that. But I like to leave that to people to explore that creatively. Like well, \"Oh gosh, okay, I can change this to this to this.\" On the trust thing, do you hurt people? I mean, that's it. Do people have a reason to believe that you are risky or dangerous? And unfortunately in a lot of habitats, the habitat itself either allows or even rewards people that are super untrustworthy to play the system in advance of the system. And as you talk to Jeffrey about the power conversation, the worse the habitat, the more his suggestions work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\nI could see that.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:35:49):\nAnd the reason that he's correct, he used the phrase, \"This is how the world always has been, is how it is, and it's how it always will be.\" Well, it's how the normal dysfunctional world always has been, is and will be. And if you want people in your organization to rise on merit and for influence to work to generate better decision-making, make better products, have a better company, move faster, et cetera, you need to create a habitat where what Jeffrey's observed about the normal dysfunctional world largely doesn't work within your habitat. So if it's effective for people to harm each other in your habitat, you are performing at a much lower level than if harming each other was extremely ineffective. And that's up to you as a leader, as a manager, et cetera. And then of course, skill is what it is. It's your ability to convert your intents into outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\nI'm glad you're talking about habitat, that's exactly where I wanted to go. So just two more things I want to spend our time on, habitat and focus, how to create more space for focus and get better focus. So you've touched on this many times at this point, this idea of a habitat. I think another way to think about this is the culture of your company. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):\nOkay, cool. So are there a few things you could recommend to people to create a habitat that is conducive of good stuff?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:15):\nLet's start at the start here. So in the difference between what science knows and business does, let's kind of zero in on the fact that the way most companies approach culture has a very shaky track record. Like if mission, vision, values was an airline, you would not allow any family to fly on that airline. It does not arrive at most of its intended destinations. That is just a super important starting point because I'm going to kill a sacred cow here while we talk about this. And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm trying to be mean or anything. It's just it's worth looking at stuff that doesn't work and wondering if there's something that could work a lot better. So if we look at habitat and culture, it's really about what people believe. It's what people believe is acceptable, permissible, productive, and the biggest flaw in people's approach to culture. And interestingly enough, even at YC, they talk about this mission, vision, values, culture, stuff that comes later, let some stuff happen with the business that comes later. They're right to say that if that's the paradigm you're going to use because it's not going to work either way. So you might as well do it later.\n\n(01:38:31):\nBut if you're going to do it the right way and investigate human beliefs, and we talked about priming for example, culture is just the macro priming of the entire business of what your central belief systems are and then the permission that forms from those belief systems. So if you've done that really well, you should do that right at the very beginning. In what way should we approach this company, building this, working together, et cetera? That would be really, really helpful to get right from day one. And the belief system that people have, there are two approaches to changing people's beliefs.\n\n(01:39:10):\nMission, vision, values is what we call a performative approach. Meaning I'm going to come up with some expression of an inspiring mission, inspiring values and inspiring vision, and it's going to be performed well enough. It's going to be like if we were busking in the park, this is going to be a cool enough mission, vision, values that people throw some change into my guitar case and they buy into it, they gather around. And I think that's just completely the wrong approach because we're hoping to inspire people. We're hoping to be artistically talented enough to pull that off. The other approach is to be deductive, logically deductive, which is centrally speaking. There is hopefully a market out there that's glad our company exists, who is glad we exist, why are they glad we exist? And that's shifting our mission into something that we call your role, the role you play in the world around you.\n\n(01:40:08):\nWho is glad you exist? Why are they glad you exist? And that is a fact. That is not an inspiring idea. That is like, okay, we work with this company that does AI-based optical character recognition, document ingestion, et cetera. Why is the world glad that they exist? Well, because we get 95% of the documents scanned into structured data that normally people have to transfer by hand. That's pretty compelling. Why is the world glad Warby Parker exists? Because before you used to choose between looking dumb and it being cheap and looking cool and it being expensive, and now you can look cool and it's cheap. The world's really glad we exist.\n\n(01:40:50):\nNow that's true. I don't need you to be inspired to believe that that is true. And now everything that we're going to think about for the rest of our beliefs, we're going to deduce from that. So we're just going to use logic to build our culture, not inspiration. So this next thing we need to figure out is how can we understand the specific value that's created when we play this role in the world? We save people money, we save people time, we open up markets, we help people explore possibilities and potential they couldn't tap into otherwise, etc.\n\n(01:41:21):\nSo what's the role of Core? People are glad we exist because we tap into potential they had no access to before. And at the team level, at the company level, that could be a really big deal. So we know that and we say, \"Okay, well gosh, that implies so much.\" There's so much we got to do now what value does that produce? And then I could say, okay, once we understand the definition of value, which comes out of our role, now we can change the definition of done. So a lot of teams talk about bias to action. And hamsters have bias to action. They get up out of their straw and they turn that wheel as hard as they possibly can and they go absolutely nowhere. But if you understand the role you play-\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:42:01):\nBut if you understand the role you play in the world, and you understand the value you produce in terms of time savings, cost savings, upside, whatever it is that you do, then you can say, \"We should have a bias to impact, not a bias to action. We shouldn't just do stuff, we should have an effect that has the result of value creation. We should save people time.\" And now when you're a product team, looking at this, and you're saying, \"Well, here's a cool new idea, Lenny, let's do this.\" You can now use that as a habitat level permission to be like, \"Oh, how does that produce value for people? How does that make people go faster, save time, get smarter, do something they couldn't do otherwise?\" And then you can still use that exact same vocabulary when you go sell it to them, \"This is how it makes you faster, smarter, more efficient, save cost.\"\n\n(01:42:50):\nSo it's like really logical deduction. And if people think that we should do something, build a product that doesn't create value. Now instead of being inspiring, we can be logical. We don't build things that produce no value, that is not a priority until we can turn it into something that does produce value. So you're turning culture into something highly usable, in getting away from performative culture into logical deductive culture. And I think that's really, really the key for most people is to say, \"Let's understand why the world's glad we exist.\" That's why we have a team, that's why we have customers. And what does that imply about our standards for ourselves when we execute in value creation? Even down to the email. If I send some wonky email reply to somebody's question and it doesn't produce value for them, I'm not done. I need to finish the job until it produces value for them.\n\n(01:43:43):\nQuality standards are baked into this, that again is implied. Would I be happy that Warby Parker exists, if they shipped me something that's a two out of 10 in quality? No. So we can't make things that are two out of 10. And everybody has a belief. There are plenty of people that probably interview at Warby Parker that think, two out of 10 is perfectly fine, just get it to them. And no, we need an antibody to that belief. We have decision-making intelligence, which everybody believes we should go fast, break stuff, or we should be super slow, and get everything right and wherever in between. That's a fun one to talk about. And then finally, you have a teaming dynamic belief, which is essentially every single human's belief of what is acceptable treatment of other human beings. What state does that put the other human in?\n\n(01:44:35):\nAnd a lot of people, particularly like I'll pick on myself with the low politeness, will spend years thinking, \"I'm giving honest feedback quickly. This is efficient.\" And you're like, \"How is it efficient when it takes people six months instead of six minutes to act on your feedback because they just don't like you so much, and you have this appeal problem that keeps you out of all the rooms?\" Actually your utility, which, your politeness is a utility transferred mechanism, but we don't want you in the room. So you're not a business benefit in this case. So that's kind of the starting point. That's ground zero of habitat is do not build an habitat on the roots of inspiration. It doesn't work. It can work, right? If you do it super inspiring stuff and you're super inspiring people, then you probably have the artistic ability to pull that off. But even then, you'd still be better off if you would do it through logical deduction instead of inspiration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):\nSay someone is like, \"Okay, I'm going to improve my habitat, I'm going to improve my company culture. Or I'm just going to start setting up a good habitat.\" What's something they can do? What can they do today, this week, to just start to do that? Is it, sit down and think about what is the value we provide? Why do we exist? Is there something else you'd recommend?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:45:54):\nSo the brain craves an answer to the question, why am I doing this? And not only are there things we should start doing, but I like to deepen the commitment in people's minds to what we should start doing, by thinking of it as, we should start doing things that we've been negligent in doing, right? Not just, oh, this would be even better, but we are actually causing some habitat problems by being negligent in certain things. So the primary thing that people are negligent in is answering the question, why should I do this, to their team. And saying, you should do this because it's your job is a form of negligence, right? You're not actually answering that question in any useful way. Because I could also answer that in the safety way, which I sort of just did by saying, it's your job. I'm implying that there's a consequence. But I could be like, because if you don't, here's the specific bad things that will happen.\n\n(01:46:52):\nYou could be giving them a why in terms of reward, because, oh, if you do this, you get this, or if we do this, we get this. But you could also be giving them a purposeful answer to why, which is not a form of negligence, which is to say, because our work actually matters. There are people out there waiting on us to ship this product to improve their situation, and they also want us to get it right at the same time. So bias to impact through that lens. We do need to ship this. It needs to happen, and it needs to be right, or at least right enough in its first version.\n\n(01:47:28):\nSo if you have been negligent, and we all have at times, right? I'm not trying to judge, but I'm trying to convict, right? To build some conviction, to build some commitment. If you have been negligent in answering to all these minds that work with you, why we're even doing this. That's the starting point, is make sure everybody knows why. And that why is a shared why across the team. And not just the Simon Sinek big picture why? I mean, very specific why. That for my team, when we build training materials, when we look at it through that lens of, if we get this right, this is what happens to teams, and companies, and products and their customers.\n\n(01:48:12):\nThere's a through line at the big deal and that's why we can't do it this way, or that's why we should get more obsessed with quality, and why we should get more interdependent as a team and stop doing things that are just our own ideas. But say, \"Hey Lenny, I'm thinking about doing it this way. Is there anything you'd add before I hit go?\" And then you'd be like, \"Oh, I think it would be 10% better if you did it this way.\" And then now our product is 10% better. So that's kind of the square one is ask yourself, when's the last time our team had a conversation about why we're even doing any of this? What value it produces? Who is affected by our decisions? And if that hasn't happened in a while, that's not good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:57):\nIs another way to think about this, your mission, is that a term?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:49:02):\nYeah, I think it's an alternative to mission, I try... And I don't want to stomp all over mission, vision, values because I think they can work. But I think it's easier for people to conceptualize the importance of their work, if they understand, we are playing a role, not fulfilling a mission. And role implies obligation. There's no obligation in mission, unless you feel the inspiration so powerfully. And these differences are subtle, but neurologically, it's different. If I tell your brain, \"Here are the people counting on you to get this right, Lenny.\" Your brain activates a region called the anterior insular cortex, which starts to think about other people in the context of the solution you're creating.\n\n(01:49:45):\nAnd if I say, \"We are here to change people's lives through this,\" in a more general sense, your prefrontal cortex will still activate to solve the problem, but your anterior insular cortex will not, to more deeply consider the humans affected by the problem. So you're kind of adding to the toolkit of what the brain will bring to the table to generate solutions. And if you activate more good regions of the brain, you get better solutions. So I lean into this. Personally, I'm like, \"You really don't need a mission statement. You need to understand the role you play, and people need to have some response, some physiological, like, 'I get it, to my actions impact people.'\" And if they don't have a response, you should go find a human who does, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:35):\nOne last thread I want to follow, focus. You have some really cool advice on how to help. And this just comes from everybody wants to get better focus. Everyone wants their team to have more time for focus. Everyone wants their engineers to sit there and build things faster, their designers to get stuff done. And it all comes from getting really good at focus and creating space for focus on your team. What advice do you have for folks that want to personally learn to focus better, and to help their team have more time for focus, get stuff done essentially?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:51:10):\nI mean, isn't this the question? Because this is where it all ends, right? First things first, let's look at the neuroscience that we have available to us. Which is, the study of focus either is or is tightly associated with the study of what's called brain waves. That's becoming a lot more popular. We're seeing it even in athletes, like professional golfers, or studying how their brain waves are focused on the golf shot and which mode to put the brain into to play golf at the highest level. Same thing applies to work. There's a bunch of different kind of bands of brain waves. Most of them actually are when you're asleep. So your REM cycles, your deep sleep cycles, your kind of drowsy cycles, those are brain waves. You can feel your brain turning off, you can feel your brain turning on when you dream. But when you're awake, there's really three primary modes that your brain is in.\n\n(01:52:03):\nThe nerdy side of this, kind of the nerdy language is alpha, beta and gamma. Those are the distinct ranges of brain activity, and they basically represent how focused your brain is. So alpha is quite simply daydreaming. So your brain is very quiet and empty. Easy metaphor is if you're in your house at night and everything's quiet, you hear things that you don't hear during the daytime, and that's what alpha is like in the brain. Your brain is actually working subconsciously a lot. But when you're busy, which is beta, your brain is too noisy to hear any of those little creaks and pops in the house. But when you're in alpha, you hear stuff.\n\n(01:52:41):\nSo the most common setting for alpha for most people is the shower. So it unlocks this mystery of like, why do I have all these ideas in the shower? Well, it's because your brain is in alpha. It hears these little creaks and pops inside of the attic, and it unpacks them. He goes, \"Oh, that's an interesting idea,\" it comes out of nowhere. It can be driving, gardening, car washing, cycling, whatever. As long as there's not too much cognitive load, then you can be daydreaming. And I'll come back to this in a second because there's a big permission problem at the habitat level for some of these focus levels.\n\n(01:53:14):\nBeta is productivity mode. So if you've ever seen somebody with a poster on their back wall that says, \"Get shit done,\" that's basically just a poster that says beta on it. I love beta. And answer emails, have meetings, write code. And there are some gamma code, deeper thinking scenarios where you're writing code, delivering presentations, making presentations. So much of our workday is beta, and it's just... I mean, some of us have an infinite amount of demand for beta work. There's just a never ending stream of stuff we could do and get done.\n\n(01:53:55):\nAnd then gamma is your brain's intense focus. So if you're learning something really complicated, you're learning thermodynamics in college or something like that, and you're just like, \"Wow, this is not easy.\" And you have to really push your brain to grapple with these concepts, connect the dots, even remember certain things, that's gamma. And we feel that sometimes at work, that here's a problem, a complex issue that we could tackle in beta by slapping duct tape on it, or we could tackle in gamma by reverse engineering, and going deep. And that's where we start to connect the dots that we talked about earlier, that focus and reverse engineering are related. That in beta, you have no intention to learn anything new to get something done, to think more deeply to get something done, to reconsider an existing process, or structure, or framework in your mind to get something done, you're going to utilize those things to get something done.\n\n(01:54:52):\nGamma is where we go, \"I would normally do it this way. I can see why that's not the right way. I need to make something new. I need to break my framework and build a brand new one right now to do something.\" So we generally spend too much time in beta in work, and that's both a judgment call, because I certainly have my own opinion about beta. I call it the conscientiousness crisis, which is conscientiousness wants beta, openness wants gamma. I'm kind of thinking of tying these pieces together. And it's not that conscientiousness is inherently a crisis, but when you meet teams that haven't done any innovation, haven't rethought the market, have become insensitive to changes in the environment around them, have become insensitive to their own employee problems and are still just kind of like this locomotive that keeps on going, irrespective of what's going on around it. It's that heads-down form of conscientious beta, that feels like, \"Now's not the time, let's stay focused, let's stay focused,\" et cetera.\n\n(01:55:53):\nSo we don't want to get rid of beta, we got a lot of work to do. But let's put a rule of thumb out there for people to explore, because it's going to be subjective to every team and every company. But as a rule of thumb, if 25% of your year is spent in gamma and alpha, you're probably a lot better off than the teams who spend less than 25% of their year thinking deep, and being in this more daydreaming mode. So what I wanted to circle back on is, how could we possibly daydream productively? Well, that's preposterous. And this is where you can build in your mind... And I do have another PDF for this, if people want to see it.\n\n(01:56:32):\nBut you can build in your mind a 3 x 3 grid where we have the safety system, reward, and purpose system in columns. We have alpha, beta and gamma in rows, and we basically have a list of nine channels that the brain can activate to generate different types of thinking. And most of the companies out there, most of the teams out there, are primarily, all their programming comes from safety beta and reward beta. How can I be busy to get rewards, ROI, customers, deals, whatever? Even promotions, more self-centered kind of rewards? And beta safety, which would be, how can I be busy? Optics, manage my reputation, avoid risk, that sort of stuff?\n\n(01:57:19):\nThe crisis is basically realizing, spending too much time in those two out of our nine available boxes, is probably not generating anywhere near the ideal outcomes. And if we could instead shift to the purposeful column by answering that brain's craving for why, with an answer that explains, it's not about you, it's not about us, it's about other people are counting on us to get this stuff right, does that matter to you? Because for most people, they're like, \"Yeah, that's actually really cool. I can have an impact on real stuff happening in other people's lives and in the world outside of me?\" So that that activates, now all of a sudden we can say, okay, let's look at alpha across the top row.\n\n(01:58:06):\nAlpha safety is when you get in the shower, and all of your anxieties, worries, et cetera, come out of nowhere, out of the attic of your mind. What happens in alpha reward? It's when you have these breakthroughs of how to get a deal, how to win something. It's daydreaming, but your brain is primed to daydream in a certain way, whether it's about anxiety or anger, or whether it's about rewards you care about. If it's purpose, this is where from a vision perspective, a possibilities product perspective, you're going to have all sorts of crazy cool ideas pop into your mind if you've primed your brain to being purposeful and then you daydream.\n\n(01:58:44):\nAnd you can do this in the middle of a day. Certain companies, it's easier than others. But if you can push away from your desk, and just go sit in a park or something for 10 minutes, 20 minutes and calm your brain down, listen, something cool will probably happen in your brain. I can't guarantee that, but you have to experiment with it to find out how it works for you. And then the same thing for gamma, when you hear phrases like, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives,\" that is the gamma prevention team kicking the door down and saying, \"We're here to get you back into beta. Everybody, put your hands behind your backs,\" sort of a thing.\n\n(01:59:22):\nAnd that's where the habitat and the focus kind of matters because you will not ever get a gamma idea from a beta mind. You will never get an alpha idea from a beta mind. So if your business needs some breakthrough, daydreaming, interesting ideas in order to create adjacencies to build new products, to seek new markets, to better fulfill the role you're playing within this market, then team has to have permission to enter that intellectual focused state, or that you're turning that channel off. You're taking that off of the programming available through your particular subscription.\n\n(02:00:04):\nAnd the same thing applies to gamma. The habitat basically needs to establish that gamma is a viable channel for a lot of work, and there's permission to go into it. You can certainly overdo it. That's why I say 25%, you don't need to spend half of your year, three-quarters of your year in gamma. It bonkers how smart you can be if you spend three or four hours in an afternoon in that deep-focused state, you'll just do stuff you'd never do. And if you can get the team to have off-sites that are gamma-focused, everybody's scatter and be alone, and do this stuff that are gamma and alpha-focused, that are productive and you bring ideas back. You're just simply going to generate thinking and outcomes that you wouldn't otherwise. And it may be that 10 percent's right for you. It may be that 30 percent's right for you, depending on how dynamic your market and customer base are. But just to challenge yourself with the question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:00:58):\nThis stuff is so fascinating, I wish we had another hour just to dig deep into this. Because it feels like just this alone is going to really transform the way companies operate. So let's try to give people something tactical they can do to create more space for alpha and gamma waves. And essentially your advice is, a fourth of your time should be spent, if possible, in alpha and gamma time. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:01:22):\nYeah, I think that probably is overabundance, in all honesty. But if you think about it through the lens of a quarter, if you're going to be on a set of cadences, and this is probably the tactical advice. It's like, look at your cadences and say, at the quarter level, that's probably the right level of fidelity for most people to look at their calendars in terms of what big stuff should we be doing? Because six months is usually too long to do anything big. Too much has happened in the world. Year is definitely too long to wait for a cadence to kind of kick in. So quarterly is really good. And what's nice is when we cluster our gamma time on this quarterly cadence, we can take a lot of the stuff that would be what we call calendar invaders, these random conversations that come up out of nowhere. And we can be like, \"Well, we're getting ready to have an offsite, this quarter's offsite in two weeks. Can this idea wait until then to be processed?\"\n\n(02:02:16):\nSo you kind of get this nice little black hole effect, where a lot of distractions have a new home, because you've actually said, \"We're going to distinctly do stuff.\" You're saying, \"Yes, but not now,\" to a lot of distractions. But yeah, I think that's the ideal cadence. And that, for some teams, it needs to be maybe a half a day or a full day. You'll figure it out based on your own business. But what per quarter is a necessary amount of time for us to break beta and go into deep thinking analysis mode? How healthy is our operation? How smart are we being? Are we delivering value? What needs to be reevaluated from the market's experience, the customer's experience, the team's experience? Let's look at these different views of the business, and make some prioritized decisions about, we're going to make specific improvements this quarter for these areas.\n\n(02:03:10):\nAnd then even once a week, maybe just find half a day if you can, maybe, but maybe less than half a day, couple hours to be in gamma, once a week. And you'll kind of feel it out from there. But the reason the rule of thumb of 25 is out there is 25 is kind of the risk point. Because most people will be like, \"We're not even spending 5%.\" Or the perfectionist team might be like, \"We're 50.\" So if you're far away from that rule of thumb, that's a pretty good indicator it's a good time to audit yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:03:42):\nWhen you hear the term, deep work, is that generally referring to gamma time?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:03:47):\nYeah, people can use that term in a couple of ways. I think a lot of people call deep work, don't bother me beta, which could be one. And other teams might call gamma deep work, but that's probably more appropriate. I think, don't bother me beta is for some teams, they need to be told, \"No, no, use this time not just to not be interrupted, but to think differently about problems. To think about is the architecture even right? Is the way we are thinking about this even right?\" Not just get a lot of stuff done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:04:18):\nYeah. So it's not just sitting in your email and write documents, it's actually try to think about bigger problems, things that are challenging your brain, not just like, \"I'm just productive getting stuff done, getting stuff done.\" Awesome. Something that worked really well for me, similar to what you just recommended is having, I had two blocks of time during the week that were two hours or three hours long, where it's just, \"Don't bother me, deep work time.\" So I had it I think Wednesday morning and Friday morning for two or three hours. And actually in the calendars, if you book something during this time, I'll slap you. And that worked really well. And nobody complained.\n\n(02:04:54):\nWe covered a lot. Here's the things we've covered. I was just taking notes and all the advice that you've shared, how to help people run better meetings, how to get better at developing vision for their team, and company, and product, how to be a better influencer. How to build better relationships, how to create a better culture for your company, how to create more focus and more productive focus. That's a lot. I'm very proud of our conversation. Before we get to a very short lightning round, because we've gone pretty long, I want to keep it short.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:22):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:05:22):\nIs there anything else you want to share, leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we close-\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:28):\nNo, I don't think we need... I mean, there's certainly a lot more that we could talk about, but I think we don't want to melt any minds. So we want people to kind of walk away and be like, \"I can do that, I can do that, I can do that.\" So definitely pick two or three wins. I kind of call them pots of ocean to boil instead of oceans to boil. So get a few pots of ocean to boil first, and focus on that for sure. And definitely make one of those pots, if it's a problem area for you, what kind of experience you are. I mean, that's central to everything. Everything else works better in the whole system once you've boiled that pot of the ocean, and then things get easier.\n\n(02:06:05):\nAnd then I guess the only last thing I would add is, think of everything we've talked today. It might help to put some language to it as floor risers and ceiling risers. Because your company has a horizon of performance that you're heading into, and there's a bottom end of that range and a top end of that range. So as you get better at meetings, not only are you increasing... You're raising the floor to get rid of bad meetings and waste, and you might be saving a ton of time or converting useless time into useful time, but you also might be raising the ceiling.\n\n(02:06:35):\nAnd I would be really specific with yourself and your team about, which outcome are you chasing? Is it both? Is it one or the other? And say, we're actually trying to raise the floor so that our performance never goes below a certain range. We get faster, smarter as a result, fewer mistakes. Or are we actually trying to uncap a ceiling that we're dealing with right now, especially around things like strategy and vision? If we feel that those conversations always end up feeling like inconceivable arguments, we have a ceiling on our business's performance. As a result of that, can we raise that ceiling and explore a higher horizon of performance for the business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:12):\nAmazing. Evan, with that, we've reached our very exciting and very quick lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:18):\nYes, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:20):\nAll right, so let's start with what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:26):\nWell, the obvious first one is Never Split the Difference. I recommend that book to everybody in the universe. I think if you haven't read it yet, you shouldn't get your driver's license. For those who don't know, it was written by Chris Voss, he was an FBI hostage negotiator. And it explores how to negotiate with people, and not just hostages, but your colleagues, your parents, your wife, like everybody. And there's some very surprising technique in there that is unexpected, not trying to get people to agree with you, but getting them to say no, more often. Instead of saying, \"Hey, Lenny, are you willing to do this?\" Say, \"Hey, Lenny, are you opposed to doing this?\" And it's just this reversal. And \"I'm giving you the out,\" is the way he explains it. There's a whole bunch of other technique, but the more of that technique is in a team, the better. The better the team does. That's a no-brainer.\n\n(02:08:16):\nThe second one I would say, since we've kind of covered this topic a little bit about habitat today. If you enjoy reading books that are sort of root canals, but you're better off because you read them, there's a book called Never... not Never Split the Difference, there's a book called The Person and the Situation. It was written by some researchers, some psychological researchers. And what it explores is the difference between how personality influences your behavior, and how the situation you're in, or like we talked about, the habitat you're in, influences your behavior. And if you're not yet convinced that either of those matters, like, \"Oh, it doesn't. I'll do what I do regardless of the habitat, or I'll do what I do regardless of who I am,\" that book will melt the face off of that existing mental model conclusively. It's really valuable knowledge to understand the mechanics of how the situation influences a person, and how the personality influences the person.\n\n(02:09:12):\nAnd then I guess the last, maybe we'll put a fork in the road of a choose your own adventure. If you're a real student of the game, and you want go 10,000 leagues under the sea on this stuff, there's a series of books called the Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience. You can find it on Amazon. A lot of them, you can just get on your Kindle for a lot cheaper than the library-decorating version of it, but that is bonkers. It talks about how your brain applies to intelligence, emotionality, relationships. It's incredible knowledge. If you instead want to keep it more in the part of the world you experience and can see and not the brain. Thaler wrote a book called Misbehaving. It was kind of the major book about behavioral economics.\n\n(02:09:58):\nAnd again, we spend a lot of time in companies talking about the way people should act, instead of the way people do act. And behavioral economics is essentially the version of economics that's about how people do act, not how people should act. So I think that's a great field of study. And then again, Robert Greene's whole library is super valuable, especially Human Nature, if you're into that. He's a little darker of an author, certainly kind of doesn't pull punches about human nature. So those are all great books to explore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:10:28):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:10:31):\nI look more at the category level of products. I really like products that have great ergonomics. A lot of people underestimate the value of what it feels like to use the product. Are things in the right place at the right time? I just started this newsletter that's kind of like, how do you break all of what we do in a bite-sized pieces for people who are super interested in this stuff to get something weekly? And it exposed me to Beehiiv, which is a very well-designed newsletter platform, high ergonomics. I don't ever find anything hard to find. I can get things to work the way I want them to work.\n\n(02:11:07):\nSo just, I like that example. And I remember even back to when I was obsessed with finding the perfect backpack to travel with, and then you find these brands where you're going through security, and you didn't even know it, but there's a pocket designed for your phone in exactly the place you would want the pocket for your phone to be. And you're just like, \"That's so great. I love that this team designed this pocket just in the right spot.\" So that's really my focus is ergonomics in product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:11:32):\nFinal question. I saw you tweeted that people are telling you that you look like JD Vance, which is hilarious. Do you think this will be a net benefit or a net hurdle?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:11:42):\nIt'll be an incredible benefit to Halloween, because it's totally clear what I'm going to do for Halloween. Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to see what people in the street... Fortunately I live in Park City, so I don't run across a lot of people in the street who want to yell at people. But if I lived in Chicago or something like that, I would've no doubt somebody would come up and throw something at me. But yeah, I'm neutral on the topic so far, minus the Halloween bonus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:12:09):\nWe'll see. We'll see how your life changes. Evan, this has been amazing. There's so much richness to this conversation. And like I said, we've covered basically everything people want to get better at as product manager, you could say. Two final questions. Where can folks find the stuff that you do to dig deeper, to learn more, to learn more deeply from you? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:12:31):\nYeah, I mean, they can certainly find a lot of the stuff we do on our website, core-sciences.com. Find a link to that profile you talked about on there, which can be super fun to take and insightful. The newsletter, all the stuff that we do, you can kind of find out there. And then certainly Twitter. I mean, I've always been really prickly about people that get on Twitter to post only and not to interact. I'm kind of the opposite. I really love people's questions and pushback. And just yesterday, I probably spent way longer than I should have out of my portfolio management approach to time, just on a thread where I was talking to this really interesting woman about this debate almost, about the probability of people doing things based on their beliefs, which was... And then we had some kind of bystanders watching the whole thing happen, and I had a meeting with a good friend Rod afterwards, where we talked about how that all went.\n\n(02:13:28):\nSo I love to talk to people and answer questions, and I'm sure people will have plenty of questions that they'd love to dive deeper into. So I'm on Twitter for sure. And then how you can help me. I mean, fortunately for me, I'm in the business of helping other people, whether those are individuals, teams, companies. So the most helpful thing to me is you helping yourself. So if you find our content valuable, if you want to have awesome managers or anything like that in this sort of science-based, kind of more efficient approach to getting there would be interesting, then reach out. We don't bite. We're pretty easy to work with. And that would be super fun to have a conversation about what your team needs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:08):\nEvan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:14:10):\nThanks for having me. This has been really cool. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:12):\nSame for me. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "Evan LaPointe (00:00:00):\n大脑就像一个大学校园，里面有不同的院系。大多数人过于依赖他们的“历史系”。如果你转而将事情发送到更具实验性、思想开放的“科学系”，或更具创造性的“艺术系”，你将获得显著更好的答案。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):\n我知道你有很多很棒的建议，能帮助人们变得更有影响力。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:16):\n这几乎就像你在玩《艾尔登法环》(Elden Ring) 或其他一些视频游戏一样。起点是选择你的角色。嘿，我是那种扮演“抬杠者”的角色，或者我是那种“用大锤猛砸，看它是否还能屹立不倒”的人，你的个性与这些角色天然契合。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\n我们如何在团队内部建立更好的人际关系？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:33):\n关键是要问：我能提供什么样的体验？不是问我在工作中有多出色，我懂多少，我对这个过程有多重要，而是问：我是一个糟糕的体验吗？如果答案是肯定的，那么暂时不要过多担心其他部分。你必须先解决这个问题。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\n我真的对这期节目很期待。我认为这将是我在这档播客上进行过的任何其他对话都不同的。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:52):\n那么，这就是惊喜结局。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\n今天，我的嘉宾是埃文·拉蓬特 (Evan LaPointe)。埃文是 CORE Sciences 的创始人，该公司旨在教导企业和个人我们的大脑是如何实际运作的，并以此为视角，教导人们如何更有效地与团队中的其他人合作，如何开发更好的产品，如何发展业务，以及如何做出更明智、更快速的决策。埃文是一位四次创业者，他曾创立了一家名为 Satellite 的公司，该产品是当今互联网上第四大分析产品 (analytics product)，后来被 Adobe 收购，他在 Adobe 负责数字业务的产品战略和创新。\n\n(00:01:31):\n在我们的对话中，埃文分享了一个理解我们大脑运作方式的简单方法，并借此框架，探讨了我们如何在愿景工作 (vision work)、影响力、会议管理、提高专注力以及与同事建立更好、更富有成效的关系方面做得更好。这次对话完美融合了科学、理论以及大量非常实用和具体的行动方案，可以帮助你在工作中更有效率。如果你喜欢这档播客，别忘了在你最喜欢的播客应用或 YouTube 上订阅并关注它。这是避免错过未来节目并对播客帮助巨大的最佳方式。接下来，我将请出埃文·拉蓬特。埃文，非常感谢你来到这里。欢迎来到播客。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:16):\n非常感谢邀请我。我很高兴能与大家分享一些内容。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:19):\n我对这期节目非常期待，原因有三：第一，我认为这将是我在这档播客上进行过的任何其他对话都不同的；第二，我认为当我们了解大脑运作方式时，它将真正拓展我们的思维；第三，我认为它将对人们的工作方式、与他人相处以及合作方式产生真正的影响。我想，首先为听众奠定一点基础会很棒，让他们了解在实际应用这些内容之前，需要明白哪些关于大脑运作方式的知识。你能否分享一些对我们来说非常重要的大脑运作知识？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:53):\n大脑就像一个浩瀚的星系。我们在所有培训团队的项目中都会引用《国家地理》(National Geographic) 的一句话，它说大脑比宇宙中任何已知结构都更为复杂。读到这样一句话，人们很容易直接逃避这个问题。我认为对人们来说重要的是，不要逃避这个问题，而是要迎难而上。我们的任务是将大脑的复杂性转化为你可以记住的、真正简单明了的系统。这三到四个主要系统像层层堆叠一样，首先要明白大脑拥有各种系统。我把它想象成一个拥有不同院系的大学校园，你的大脑有一个负责开放性实验的“科学系”。\n\n(00:03:39):\n它有一个负责创造性无限思考的“艺术系”。它还有一个旨在查询你已知信息的“历史系”。如果你考虑将你的想法发送到校园里正确的“部门”，或者只是不同的“部门”，你将从大脑中获得截然不同的回应。我们主要受困于大多数人过于依赖他们的“历史系”。这是因为大脑的构建是为了节约能量，而这是大脑能够实现的最节能的回答问题方式。如果你转而将事情发送到更具实验性、思想开放的“科学系”，更具创造性的“艺术系”，你同情心的“人文系”等等，你将获得完全不同的答案。当然，如果你作为公司开发产品或提供服务，这些“部门”将比仅仅在你“历史系”里的参考资料给你提供显著更好的答案。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\n本期节目由 Webflow 赞助播出。我们都是朋友，所以让我们坦诚相待。我们都知道，你的网站不应该是一个静态资产 (static asset)，它应该是你的策略中一个动态的组成部分，能够驱动转化 (conversions)，这是商业入门知识 (business 101)。给你一个数字，54% 的领导者表示网站更新耗时过长。这比现在正在收听的你的一半还多。这就是 Webflow 发挥作用的地方。他们视觉优先 (visual-first) 的平台让你能够快速构建、发布和优化网页。这意味着你可以设定宏伟的商业目标，你的网站也能够应对挑战。了解像 Dropbox、IDEO 和 Orange Theory 这样的团队如何信任 Webflow 来实现他们最宏伟的目标，请立即访问 webflow.com。\n\n(00:05:21):\n本期节目由 Explo 赞助播出，它是面向客户的分析 (customer-facing analytics) 和数据报告领域的革新者 (game-changer)。你的用户是否渴望在你的产品中获得更多的仪表板 (dashboards)、报告和分析功能 (analytics)？你是否厌倦了自己动手构建？作为产品负责人 (product leader)，你的路线图 (roadmap) 中可能包含了这些需求，但优先处理它们的难题是真实存在的。从零开始构建分析功能可能耗时、昂贵且极具挑战性，而 Explo 应运而生。Explo 是一个完全可定制品牌 (white-labeled) 的嵌入式分析解决方案 (embedded analytics solution)，完全围绕你的用户设计。入门很简单。将 Explo 连接到任何关系型数据库 (relational database) 或数据仓库 (warehouse)，凭借其低代码 (low-code) 功能，你可以在几分钟内构建和设计仪表板。准备就绪后，只需使用一小段代码片段 (code snippet) 将仪表板或报告嵌入到你的应用程序中。最棒的是，你的最终用户可以使用 Explo 的人工智能功能 (AI features) 来自行生成报告和仪表板，从而减少支持团队的客户数据请求。在几天内构建并嵌入一个完全可定制品牌的分析体验。请访问 explo.co/lenny 免费试用。这是 E-X-P-L-O，点，C-O，斜杠，Lenny。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:06:34):\n第一点是，大脑拥有这些“部门”和系统，它也有“通路”(pathways)。了解“通路”这一点非常重要，因为我们每个人的大脑中，思维都有可能沿着某些路径发展。其中一些与个性有关，个性使我们倾向于产生较高或较低的焦虑反应，或者较高或较低的创造力反应。你也可以更有意识地干预这些路径，这是自我意识的重要组成部分，即了解自己的偏好是什么，然后，我是否真的让这些偏好在特定情况下占据主导，或者我是否可以更有意识地引导思维沿着这些通路，以激活大脑的最佳区域和系统。掌握这些系统最简单的方法是，它们有三个，三个非常重要的系统。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:07:25):\n你可能可以了解更多，但我们希望每个人都了解的是你的安全系统 (safety system)、奖励系统 (reward system) 和目标系统 (purpose system)。在这三个系统中，其中两个对大多数人来说听起来非常真实，而一个听起来像幻想。安全系统对大多数人来说相当明显。当我们感到害怕、恐惧、不确定、怀疑、怨恨、愤怒、冷漠等等时，我们大脑的这个系统试图恢复我们在“宇宙”中的地位，就像我需要摆脱这种压力、危险、愤怒等等。你大脑的那个部分，那个系统会设定一个目标，然后你去追求那个目标，比如“我想获得安全”。如果你在一个会议中，一个日常实际情况中，你听到让你感到不安全的言论，那么你现在的目标实际上不再是有效地为会议做出贡献。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:08:19):\n你大脑的目标是恢复安全感。奖励也是一样的道理，如果有人说“如果你这样做，你就会得到什么”，这与安全感相反，因为如果“你不这样做，就会发生不好的事情”，那么是的，你的大脑就会进入这种追求、渴望的状态，这看起来很棒，在很多情况下也确实很棒，但也可能相当狭隘。当你听到有人说，“那不是我的工作。”那实际上是奖励系统在起作用，它在说，“我会因为清单上的事情得到奖励，而你说的这件事不在我的奖励清单上，所以我对此不感兴趣。”我更容易将其推开，因为大脑的奖励系统在概念上更具交易性 (transactional)。然后你就会遇到这个听起来模糊而荒谬的目标系统。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:09:08):\n直到你意识到目标 (purpose) 是什么——我们都曾感受过——如果你理解你正在做的事情的影响，并且你理解并关心受你行为影响的人，这些就是产生目标的条件，而且这可以非常宏大。比如治愈癌症，我理解这对人们的影响，那是非常巨大的。它也可以是，比如我正在写一封电子邮件，我理解这封邮件的影响以及受其影响的人。你可以在你生活中如细沙般的微小层面感受到目标，而不仅仅是在整个海滩和海岸线层面，我们就是这样教导人们的，这超级重要。这是基础层。然后在此之上，还有几个与你的专注力相关的层面，因为大脑可以显著地将专注力从开放性思维转向深度专注。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:09:55):\n然后是能力的最后一层，它较少科学性，较少神经科学性，更多的是实用性，即你的能力由你了解多少现实情况所决定，比如你是否掌握了决策的背景信息 (context)，或者你只是知道你该做这个决策？掌握背景信息的人比没有的人能力更强。想象力与逻辑也是一样的道理，如果你在你的头脑中进一步拓展这些界限，你的能力几乎会不成比例地提升，与你付出的努力不成正比，所以这些层面层层叠加。我认为它平易近人，简单易懂。就像，我们都可以理解，我的安全、奖励还是目标系统现在处于活跃状态？我的专注力水平如何？我现在与现实、理性和想象力的连接程度如何？然后就是你作为个人或团队的产出，所有这些都像是我们可以拨动的杠杆，这非常有趣。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\n太棒了。在这里总结一下，我们有这三个系统：安全、奖励、目标；然后是我们的专注力水平；接着是能力，我们是否真的能完成这项工作？这些就是拼图块。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:03):\n我想把这个话题引申到：当我们与他人合作时，与他人合作是非常困难的，人们在工作中，在开发产品、运营公司、组建团队、招聘等方面遇到的一些困难，是他们经常会对别人的工作方式感到非常沮丧。有些人想直接动手做，有些人则喜欢深思熟虑。有些人非常注重客户定性分析、轶事（anecdote）分享，有些人则非常注重指标（metrics）。有些人非常乐于协作，喜欢团队合作，有些人则非常喜欢独立工作。首先，我们刚才讨论了大脑是如何运作的，然后又提到了人们的工作方式大相径庭。你能不能稍微谈谈，为什么人们的行为如此不同，以帮助我们学会更好地与那些让人觉得“哦，这真奇怪。这个人只想他们的账单”的人合作？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:12:02):\n也许人们脑海中流传的最糟糕的宣传语之一是“我们相似多于不同”。关于我们为什么会使用或被告知这句话，我的理论是，如果我们仔细审视听到这句话的场景，就会发现我们有一种理论：与和我们相似的人相处更容易。如果我们幻想这个人像我一样，那么我可能会和他们相处得更好。而事实上，我们可能应该培养一种能力，那就是与和我们截然不同的人相处。例如，我们在为管理者提供培训的课程中，谈到的第四个要素是人格（personality）。我们谈论你的大脑系统、你的大脑关注点、你的大脑能力，这似乎描绘了一幅人类可能彼此相似，我们可以单方面激活这些东西的图景。\n\n(00:12:54):\n然后我们必须在最后抛出这个“炸弹”：这就是为什么这在不同类型的人身上不总是奏效的原因。我知道你用了我们的评估，我们基于大五人格（Big Five-based profile，一种人格特质理论）的评估，那只是众多工具之一，可以帮助一个人了解自己在各种人格特质（personality traits）和动机（motivations）光谱中的位置。在我们的培训中，我们经常使用烹饪学校（culinary school）的比喻，我们更像是人类绩效的烹饪学校，而不是烹饪课。这有助于人们理解，在我的培训中，我习惯了去上烹饪课，学习如何进行一对一沟通、如何提供反馈、如何建立一个从产品构思到优先级排序和待办事项（backlog）的框架。而我们则会问：“那么，表面之下到底发生了什么？所有表面上出现的东西，其真正的根源是什么，是哪些潜在的原则和作用力在起作用？”\n\n(00:13:50):\n在这个烹饪学校的比喻中，对于一名厨师来说，真正重要的一件事是了解自己的偏好是什么？我喜欢吃什么？因为如果我不知道自己喜欢什么，那我就会假设其他人也喜欢我喜欢的东西，那样我就不会成为一名非常有活力的厨师。我会觉得：“每个人都喜欢菜里有很多盐和酸味。”然后你去德国开一家餐厅，就会发现：“这绝对不是我们在这道菜里想要的。”自我意识（Self-awareness）是非常重要的一步，不仅对烹饪学校如此，对每个人都如此。你处于一个光谱中的某个位置，你的大脑有这些通路和交通警察指挥着你思想中的交通。你必须从自身做起，了解自己是否倾向于礼貌地表达事物，以便它们能被很好地接受？还是我倾向于非常直率、直接，甚至可能刻薄和严厉？我是倾向于在谈话中退居次席，让事情自然发展，还是倾向于掌控局面？\n\n(00:14:48):\n我是倾向于进行理性的抽象思考，尝试解构（deconstruct）思想，还是倾向于保持非常务实（pragmatic）？如果你不知道自己是谁，并且认为整个宇宙都与你相似，那么你将会在那个更广阔的光谱中彻底迷失。我认为大五人格（Big Five），我的意思是，有很多模型。你有迈尔斯-布里格斯（Myers-Briggs）、DISC（Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness，一种行为风格测量工具）等。它们都只是衡量人格的不完美方式，但尽管不完美，它们也很有用，特别是如果你以成长心态（growth mentality）而不是辩解心态（justification mentality）来解读它们的话。如果你说：“好的，我不够礼貌，我非常直接。”你的辩解心态可能会是：“是的，说得对。我真棒，每个人都知道我的真实意思和真实感受。”而成长心态则是，嗯，也许有些情况下我可以比0%更努力一点，用一种方式来措辞，如果我们从结果倒推，我们现在想选择我们的行动，那么这些如此直接的行动是会增加还是减少那个结果的可能性呢？\n\n(00:15:54):\n那时我们就会成为更有活力的厨师，更有活力的人。人格是一个广阔的光谱，而自我意识是这一切的起点。大五模型（Big Five model）为你提供了一个很好的属性列表来审视自己，然后你应该制定一个如何做的计划。然后你可以将注意力转向你所属的人际网络，并问：“好的，既然我是我，我在哪些方面与这些其他人如此不同？”我们如何才能创造一种网状思维（mesh mentality），让思想在群体中自然地流动和适应？尤其是在产品工作中，无论你是一名创始人（founder）、创业者（entrepreneur），在这个层面上思考产品和你的团队，还是你正身处产品工作的核心，努力推动自己和他人去把事情做好，那么你都会从理解这些特质和差异中受益匪浅。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\n我认为对很多人来说，这里一个重要的突破点在于，你之所以在完成某事、与人合作、在公司取得成功、与你的经理或团队伙伴相处时感到挣扎，是因为他们的大脑运作方式非常不同，所以他们的思考方式和反应方式也大相径庭。你可能认为整个世界都像你一样思考，但事实并非如此，而这些测试能帮助你看到这一点。为了让大家更具体地理解这一点，你是否有一些经常遇到的例子或成功案例可以分享，说明如何利用这些方法在本周提高工作表现？无论是开会还是说服某人，或者其他类似的事情？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:17:28):\n我认为再加一层会有帮助，特别是如果你是领导者或管理者，那就是商业世界不仅仅是一群个体在空白的矩阵（matrix）加载屏幕上进行的肉搏战。实际上，你作为一家公司身处一个栖息地（habitat）中，你的团队就像一个栖息地。我把公司和团队看作是我们身处其中的小型玻璃生态箱（terrariums），这个生态箱是不是用沙子和加热灯搭建的，而我们是一群青蛙，就像我们要变成青蛙培根一样，仅仅因为我们身处这个栖息地？很多时候，你实际上想创建一个有利于高效思维和高效人际互动的栖息地或环境。\n\n(00:18:15):\n因为如果栖息地一开始就对你们所有人不利，那么所有将要出现的“肉搏战”实际上很大程度上是由于你们身处这个有加热灯、干燥、缺乏生命、缺乏富有成效的应对方式的环境中。这就是许多团队和公司今天的处境，尤其是那些更成熟的团队。他们要么在栖息地中迷失了方向，没有真正为良好的思维和互动打好基础，要么一开始就从未有过。其中一些事情，就像你过去与其他一些人交谈时一样，你的对话，Canva的对话，Figma的对话都让我想到，很明显，为了让人们能够高效运作，这些栖息地投入了巨大的能量。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):\n你指的是我在采访Figma和Canva的人时所说的。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:13):\n完全正确。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\n我明白了。哦，请多说一点这方面的意思。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:17):\n你想想，即使在Canva的背景下，他们用“教练”（coaches）而不是“经理”（managers）。我喜欢这一点，让我先退一步。有一句很棒的话，我认为丹·平克（Dan Pink）比任何人都更好地总结了这个问题，他说：“科学所知与商业所做之间存在脱节（mismatch）。”在这个差距中，它说：“那么，商业正在做哪些科学知道得更好的事情呢？”你几乎可以把这看作一个等式：科学所知减去你公司所做等于功能障碍（dysfunction）。这是一件非常清晰明了的事情。如果你把经理（managers）和教练（coaches）拿出来看，我认为他们是凭直觉这么做的。我不知道他们是不是神经科学家，但凭直觉，我认为许多优秀的创始人理解人类并非以某种特定方式运作，而经理的整个范式（paradigm）似乎在很多情况下都失败了。整个范式，比如口号“快速失败”（fail faster），似乎也经常失败，使命宣言（mission statements）也似乎经常失败。\n\n(00:20:22):\n你可以把“科学所知”与“商业所做”作为审视自己的视角，那些经常失败的东西值得一看。当你审视时，你会想，我们真的需要经理吗？因为这似乎经常失败。还是说有更好的范式能更好地激发人类潜能，并且一针见血？如果你计算Canva的情况，科学所知与Canva所做之间，无论他们是否知道自己做得科学，其结果都等于零。在这种情况下，科学所知与商业所做之间没有区别。还有，在Figma的谈话中，我喜欢那个短语：“想象力是假设生成引擎”（imagination is a hypothesis generation engine），我想这就是原话。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\n哦，迪伦。是的，和迪伦的聊天。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:21:14):\n我喜欢那个想法。因为当我们谈论想象力（imagination）作为能力的一部分时，我们谈论的是想象力为你生成替代方案（alternatives）的能力，这就是它的目的。它不仅仅是在无聊的会议中在页边涂鸦。那是其中一部分，是一个附带的好处。当你审视想象力的目的时，如果你有很好的想象力，你生活中总会有很多选择。米老鼠（Mickey Mouse）就是一个选择。它就像一种通过一只会说话的老鼠来传递信息的新替代方式。比如说，这很好，这很有趣。我们非常关注的假设生成引擎的另一部分是，它不仅是生成选择和假设的能力，它也是将它们加载到你的Oculus头显（Oculus headset，一种虚拟现实设备）中，并在一个那个选择已经被执行的世界中漫步的能力。这在某种程度上类似于愿景（vision），即你是否有很好的能力将想象之树的这个分支，这个假设加载到模拟（simulation）中，然后探索这个世界在它到位之后会是什么样子？\n\n(00:22:23):\n如果你看看Canva正在进行的这种教练式管理 (coaching thing)，而不是传统的管理方式，你把它加载到模拟器 (simulator) 中，你会觉得：“哇，这看起来相当不错。这是一个更高性能的事情。”通过倡导而非监管，我们实现了增长。这种方法本身就包含了很多方面，如果问一个神经科学家 (neuroscientist)，这会更好吗？他们会说：“哦，当然。那会好得多。”因为它会激活大脑的某个部分，降低皮质醇 (cortisol，一种压力荷尔蒙)，它做了所有这些科学已知效果更好的事情。从非常深层到非常战术性 (tactical) 的层面，有一长串我们可以做得不同的事情，这些事情可以缩小你正在做的与科学已知之间的差距，随着你做这些事情，功能失调 (dysfunction) 就会不断缩小。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\n你是否发现，基于大脑的运作方式，人们在工作方式上可以做出哪些改变？无论是更好地开会，还是更好地施加影响？人们这周可以尝试做些什么，能让他们在工作或与同事合作中取得更大的成功？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:23:32):\n在科学已知和商业实践的清单中，一切都在其中。文化 (Culture) 在其中，会议在其中，目标 (goals) 在其中，截止日期 (deadlines) 在其中，团队动态 (team dynamics) 也在其中。我们可能会从那一长串清单中挑选几项。会议是一个很好的例子。会议，我忘了具体的统计数据 (statistic) 是多少，但那是一个惊人的十二位数，不，不是十二位，是九位数，不，是十二位数，数千亿美元 (hundreds of billions') 的浪费都发生在会议中。我们在会议上花费了巨额资金 (gazillions of dollars) 和时间。对我们来说，就像在我们的项目中，平均差值 (delta) 在10%到20%之间。人们仅仅通过改进使用会议的方式，每周就可以节省半天到一整天的工作时间。其中一部分是会议的设计，比如把会议当作一个产品 (product) 来对待，把它们当作应该有组织地、有目的地 (intentionally) 使用的工作流程 (workflows)；但很大一部分是在会议内部，比如策略 (tactic) 是什么？\n\n(00:24:38):\n这是一个非常战术性 (tactical) 的建议：一般来说，如果从会议阶段的视角来看，会议是预热 (priming) 和决策 (decision making) 的结合。很多会议完全跳过了预热 (priming) 步骤。他们直接进入了决策 (decision making) 阶段。如果我们假设在座的每个人都在同一页 (on the same page，达成共识)，拥有相同的信息，并且通常来说，都希望达到相同的结果 (same outcome)，那么跳过预热步骤 (priming step) 可能是安全的。但我认为对于大多数会议来说，这是一个荒谬的假设 (ludicrous assumption)，然而大多数人实际上惊讶地发现我们并没有达成共识，尽管我们从未达成过共识，只要你们一起工作超过一天。我们不做预热 (priming) 真是件疯狂的事情，而预热可以是简单的。它甚至可以在邀请函 (invite) 中完成。关于Outlook和Google日历，有一点很疯狂，你可以把一个非常糟糕、毫无用处的会议放到Outlook里，它永远不会去看一眼，然后说：“这可能没用。”\n\n(00:25:46):\n就像你可以进入Trello，把你公司历史上最蠢的项目放进去，它会不加任何价值判断地 (discernment as to its value) 吸收你放进去的任何东西。现在，想象一下，我们暂时必须自己做这件事，直到更好的日历工具出现，但想象一下，如果Outlook、Google Calendar或Cron（现在是Notion的一部分）会说：“嗯，嗯，嗯。这次会议的目的是什么？”你可能会说：“好的，这次会议是为了生成备选方案 (generation of options)，或是创造性地解决问题 (creative problem solving)，或是非常战术性地解决问题 (tactical problem solving)，或是寻求效率 (efficiency seeking)，又或者，我们即将进行的对话类别 (category of conversation) 是什么？应该适用哪些基本原则 (basic principles)？我们是在尊重既定规则 (honoring sacred cows，指被视为神圣不可侵犯的人事物)，还是在打破既定规则 (eating sacred cows，指挑战禁忌)？什么是模式心态 (mode mentality)，即预热 (priming)？我们如何能都说，这就是适用于这次会议的思维模式 (mindset) 和最终目的 (ultimate purpose)？”\n\n(00:26:52):\n你可以在三分钟内写完并阅读这些内容。这并不是一个艰巨 (arduous) 的过程。亚马逊 (Amazon) 以其艰巨的过程而闻名，他们也这样做。这就是智慧，知道我们需要预热 (priming)。他们足够明智，认识到了预热的必要性。他们将其执行得非常强有力 (robust execution)。它不一定非要那么强有力。跳过预热是非常糟糕的。其他会议则把预热 (priming) 和决策 (decision-making) 的顺序搞反了。我们开始开会。你听说过钻石形思维 (diamond-shaped thinking，一种会议结构，先发散再收敛) 吗？让我们以发散性思维 (expansionary thought) 开始会议，然后以收敛 (convergence，达成一致) 结束会议的后半部分。然而，我们却以收敛 (convergence) 开始会议，然后意识到我们无法调和会议室里各方收敛的需求。\n\n(00:27:39):\n然后你可能会在会议中途听到这样的话：“好吧，让我们重新开始，记住我们为什么都在这里。”我们在会议的后半部分进行预热 (priming)，恰好赶在会议结束之前。这是一个人们可以做的非常明显的事情，但人们在预热 (priming) 中却很少这样做。我很乐意生成一个清单，这样我们就不必把所有事情都谈一遍，但也许可以制作一些小的PDF文件 (PDFs) 或类似的东西供人们下载，上面写着：“优秀的预热是怎样的。”然后当你进行决策时，上面会写着：“优秀的决策是怎样的。”这样，你就可以有一个小小的指南。再重申一次，你自己算算吧，科学知道的，我们在这次会议中做的。我们跳过了一堆步骤，这增加了功能失调 (dysfunction) 或出错的概率，所以让我们缩小这个概率，而不是让它增长。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\n太棒了。如果你有这些，那就太好了。我们一定会把链接放到节目笔记 (show notes) 中。这里的建议是：确保当你开始或主持一个会议时，要让每个人都围绕着我们要解决的问题，或者我们希望从这次会议中得到什么，以及背景 (context) 进行预热 (prime)，而不是直接进入决策 (decision making)。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:28:44):\n非常值得注意的是，适用的原则 (principles)。我认为那真的非常非常重要，不仅仅是我们来这里要做什么，更是我们如何能最好地思考这件事。你甚至可以就原则进行辩论，而且就原则进行辩论远比就那些源于你们原则严重不一致 (super misaligned principles) 的战术 (tactics) 进行辩论要好得多。如果一个人在做决定时考虑的是速度 (speed)，而另一个人在做决定时考虑的是准确性 (accuracy)，那么他们之间在会议上发生激烈争吵 (cat fight，指激烈的争执) 是完全不可避免的。除非他们回头重新审视这个事实：在更深层次上，我们是以完全不同的心态 (mentality) 和完全不同的目标 (objectives) 来处理这件事的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):\n太棒了。如果你最终能提供这些关于成功预热方式的PDF文件 (PDFs)，那就太好了。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:36):\n当然。会的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\n好的，太好了。人们还能做些什么来更好地工作。我知道你在如何更有效地施加影响 (influence more effectively) 方面有一些建议。我知道你在战略和愿景 (strategy and vision) 方面也有一些建议，所以也许我们可以朝着这两个方向探讨。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:50):\n让我们从战略和愿景 (strategy and vision) 开始，因为我认为在你开始影响他人 (influencing people) 之前，最好先擅长战略和愿景。你会在生活中遇到的，在你脑海中，是各种想法涌动 (ideas are swirling)。无论是你自己产生这些想法还是别人产生，你的大脑都会将这些想法分为：相信的 (believed)、可信的 (believable)、某种程度上的可想象的 (conceivable) 和不可想象的 (inconceivable)。你可以用自己的词语来描述，但这就像一个起点，那就是如果有人说了你已经经历过的事情，那对你的大脑来说是相信的。如果我们说我们应该实施一个OKR框架 (OKR framework，目标与关键成果框架，一种目标管理方法)，而你之前在工作场所经历过，或者你读过所有关于谷歌 (Google) 实施它的文章，那么你就会说：“是的，我们应该。它会清理掉这里很多杂乱的东西。好的，太棒了。”你的大脑已经处于“是”的状态。\n\n(00:30:47):\n如果它是可信的 (believable)，也许你正在阅读《哈佛商业评论》(Harvard Business Review)，你在阅读一些你的公司从未做过、你自己也从未做过的事情，但有所有这些证据表明它有效，并且从机制上 (mechanically) 讲对你来说有道理，所以你会说：“好的，是的，我发现这很可信。”现在我们倾向于“是”，或者我们仍然在“是”的范畴内。现在我们进入这些不可信但可能可想象的 (unbelievable, yet maybe conceivable) 事情。这些事情似乎是牵强的 (far-fetched)。回到关于Canva的对话，你与Uri的对话。这些领导者完全相信的大多数事情，对大多数其他领导者来说是不可信的。我们不需要管理者？我不相信。现在我们已经把心态从内在的顺风 (inbuilt tailwind) 转向了内在的逆风 (inbuilt headwind)。这就是为什么人们在战略 (strategy) 和愿景 (vision) 方面会遇到困难，因为每个人的思维都基于我们之前谈到的个性 (personality)，相信的 (believed) 之间的分界线 (line of demarcation)，我们都有不同的生活经验 (lived experience)，所以你拥有的经验越多，你相信的东西就越多。\n\n(00:32:03):\n然后是可信的 (believable)，再然后是不可信但可想象的 (unbelievable, but yet conceivable)，这些界线因人而异。一个对Uri来说完全有道理的想法，他可能在无数次会议中都遇到过别人说：“那永远行不通。”尽管显然，科学知道，例如，它完全可行。科学在烹饪学校的一个巨大好处是，我们不必重塑 (reinvent) 那些已经证明 (proven) 的想法。我们已经知道某些事情会激活人们有目的的状态，以及寻求理解、寻求更深入的问题解决、寻求人际连接 (human connection) 的完整大脑。这些都是已知的事实，就像关于设计价值的辩论也存在于战略和愿景 (strategy and vision) 中。我们如何知道这里更好的设计会有投资回报率 (ROI，投资回报率)？嗯，如果你能反驳 (disprove) 这一点而不是证明它，因为过去一百万人问这个问题都证明了它。\n\n(00:32:54):\n如果你能反驳 (disprove) 它，你可能会因为是第一个反驳一个确凿无疑 (ironclad) 的事物而赢得诺贝尔奖 (Nobel prize)。就像，我们已经完成了。我们已经结束了这场辩论。我认为，这就是我们必须在自己身上认识到的。自我意识 (self-awareness) 的一个重要部分是，我们不可信的阈值 (unbelievable threshold) 从哪里开始，我们可信的阈值 (believable threshold) 到哪里结束。然后，不可想象的 (inconceivable) 就像是“给我滚出办公室”的程度。许多在企业内部发生的愿景思考和对话 (vision thinking and dialogue) 直接激活了人们不可想象的 (inconceivable) 反应，而没有任何自我意识 (self-awareness) 认识到，那是一个个人问题，而不是一个客观问题 (objective problem)。我认为对于公司和个人来说，投资于自身以思考“我是否有能力识别那些我认为不可想象但可能完全错误的情况？”这一点真的非常非常重要。这样我们就可以避免在我们和实验 (experimentation) 之间可能存在的数月争论。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:34:00):\n……那些存在于我们和实验 (experimentation) 之间的争论。所以我认为这是它的起点。如果我们要按数字涂色 (paint by numbers，比喻按部就班) 来做这件事，你想推倒哪些多米诺骨牌 (dominoes)？了解你的人格特质，我们在大五人格模型 (Big-5 model，心理学中的一种人格特质理论) 中倾向于关注的是开放性 (openness)。如果你的开放性较低，你的大脑基本上会将抽象的 (abstract)、创造性的 (creative)、智力的 (intellectual)、复杂的思维 (complex thinking) 连接到大脑的疼痛系统 (pain systems)。这就是你的神经回路 (wiring) 的运作方式。一旦事情变得抽象，你不仅会觉得“我不喜欢这个”，你还会对这类想法产生更本能的负面反应 (visceral negative response)，你现在正进入你的痛苦区域 (pain cave)，而房间里的其他人可能拥有所有那些抽象的、创造性的、探索性思维 (exploratory thinking)，并将它们连接到他们的奖励系统 (reward systems)。\n\n(00:34:55):\n所以，这是你需要真正了解的事情。而脆弱性 (vulnerability) 是应对这种情况的最佳方法。因为如果你想到骨牌效应的第二张牌，一旦你了解了这些，那么问题就是：我们如何在团队中传播 (socialize) 这些知识？比如说，在一个 C 级高管 (C suite) 团队、一个领导团队，或者是一个创始人、联合创始人以及其他领导成员组成的团队中。我们在这方面与 YC (Y Combinator，一家著名的创业孵化器) 公司合作很多，因为它超级重要。当他们雇佣人员时，每一次新增的雇员都增加了心理多样性 (psychological diversity)，这彻底改变了这些对话的进行方式。\n\n(00:35:27):\n所以，了解了这一点，好吧，我们有哪些选择来传播这些知识呢？脆弱性 (vulnerability) 是最好的选择。但是 Brené Brown 会为了脆弱性本身而推销它，并不是所有人都接受为了脆弱性本身而推销，因为它是一件可怕的事情。但当我们考虑到其他替代方案有多么可怕时，它就会变得不那么可怕了。我可以假装隐藏它，这是我的另一个选择；或者我可以不隐藏它，像个塔斯马尼亚恶魔 (Tasmanian devil，一种狂暴的动物，比喻行事不顾后果)，然后毫不道歉。所以这是你的三个选择，当你意识到我可以表现出脆弱性，我可以尝试隐藏它，或者我可以毫不道歉时，与脆弱性相比，另外两个选择是具有毁灭性的 (ruinous)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):\n你说的关于开放性 (openness) 以及不擅长宏大愿景 (big vision) 和头脑风暴 (brainstorming) 的事情，让我深有共鸣，因为那完全就是我。所以我做了你的测试，它叫什么？顺便问一下，你把这个测试称为什么？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:27):\n我们称之为 CORE identity (核心身份)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nCORE identity (核心身份) 测试。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:29):\n是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):\n好的，很好，我们会在节目备注中附上链接。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:32):\n好的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):\n所以我做了这个测试，它基本上是基于大五人格 (Big-5) 模型：宜人性 (agreeableness)、尽责性 (conscientiousness)、外向性 (extraversion)、开放性 (openness)，以及以前称为神经质 (neuroticism)，现在称为稳定性需求 (need for stability)。我正在看它。实际上，我自己也知道这一点，我的开放性 (openness) 分数相当低，我不太喜欢看到这个，但它确实非常符合你所说的，我不太擅长宏大愿景 (big vision) 的思考。比如当有人提议，比方说我团队的设计师提议对我们的整个设计进行宏大愿景 (big vision) 的重新思考时，我就会说“不”。那是我的痛苦区 (pain cave)，就像你说的，这正是这个测试所反映的。\n\n(00:37:10):\n所以，我认为这是一个非常强有力的例子，它让你理解你的大脑会如何回应那些完全异想天开 (totally out there)、难以想象 (inconceivable) 的事情，或者你会怎么称呼它？某种程度上可以想象，但不一定可信的事情。意识到你的大脑是这样运作的，是非常有力量的；意识到其他人在这方面有非常不同的体验，也是非常有力量的。你在这里的建议是，首先，这种“栖息地” (habitat) 的组合，创造一个拥有各种思维方式的人的环境，其中有些人会在进行宏大思考时感到快乐，然后沿着这些思路，你关于坦诚 (vulnerably) 分享的观点是，嘿，这就是我，我的开放性 (openness) 较低，我的团队需要理解这一点，让我们一起努力，不要让这阻碍我们。对吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:38:04):\n是的，没错。我的意思是，如果你把这些想法看作是方枘圆凿 (pegs in holes)，我们会拿一个创意形的钉子，试图把它穿过一个更务实形的孔，这其中存在一个沟通上的障碍 (translation problem)，而且这是一个巨大的负担。如果团队确实需要创新 (innovative)，那么仅在转化沟通上花费的时间就是一个巨大的负担，要把那些准确但难以想象 (inconceivable) 的有远见的战略性想法 (visionary strategic ideas)，转化为对于那些需要更具体事物的人来说感觉可信的想法。\n\n(00:38:45):\n当然，这里最常见的场景是投资回报率 (ROI, Return on Investment)，这是对任何想法都必问的经典问题：投资回报率 (ROI) 是多少？如果一个想法本质上产生的是多阶效应 (nth order effects) 而非一阶效应 (first order effects)，那么，四季酒店 (Four Seasons hotel) 大堂里摆放新鲜花卉的投资回报率 (ROI) 是多少呢？四季酒店有两种可能性，他们要么对这个问题有一个能满足务实形孔的答案，要么他们在自己的环境中已经表明，我们不问这类问题，因为它们是巨大的时间浪费。\n\n(00:39:28):\n如果你考虑的是竞争激烈的市场 (competitive market)，你面试的大多数人都身处高度竞争的市场中，那些在行动之前花费更少时间进行令人满意的语言转化 (translating satisfactory language) 的团队，他们最终会采取行动，有时是市场迫使他们采取行动。他们花了太多的时间纠结于投资回报率 (ROI) 的对话或合理性论证 (justification)，即转化沟通 (translation conversation)，最终客户开始流失，员工开始离开，然后他们才会说：“哦，好吧，现在变得更可信了。”嗯，那是因为它已经从想法的领域进入了我们眼前可见的物理世界。\n\n(00:40:05):\n而那个团队，因为他们停留在转化阶段 (translation phase) 而非实验阶段 (experimentation phase)，在市场上处于巨大的劣势 (huge disadvantage)。如果你与一个团队正面竞争，这就是我喜欢 Figma (一家在线设计协作工具) 对话的原因，那个环境本身就是为速度而生的，因为环境本身，你的大脑里铭刻着这样的词语：我们不会在转化阶段 (translation phase) 浪费时间，我们不会花费太多时间。我们在财务部门 (finance departments)、产品部门 (product departments) 等之间的相互作用中经常看到这一点，一个权力过大的首席财务官 (overpowered CFO) 可能会开始提出一些没有答案的问题，这只是将团队拖入一种截然不同的语言，这种语言比业务的经验性语言 (experiential language) 更为字面化，所以你总是能看到这种情况发生。\n\n(00:40:59):\n但我认为脆弱性 (vulnerability) 很棒，因为如果你坐在会议上，你，Lenny，你说：“这不是我的领域，基本上你说的所有事情都难以想象 (inconceivable)。”现在我正在对你坦诚 (honest)，没有人会因为你坦诚而讨厌你，他们实际上会很高兴你对这个差距 (gap) 坦诚，而不是很高兴你如此确信自己是决策过程中可以作为参考的合适人选 (right human to index off of in the decision-making process)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\n你建议坦诚地分享的是：“这是我的个性 (personality)，这是我的 CORE identity (核心身份)。”我不知道你会用什么语言，但这不是“我认为这一切都难以想象 (inconceivable)”，而是“我认为这一切都难以想象 (inconceivable)，因为这是我思考的方式。”\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:41):\n绝对如此，是的，详细解释清楚 (unpack the detail)，当然。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\n明白了。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:43):\n是的，我的意思是告诉人们，这让我的大脑怎么想，所有这些抽象的、以未来为中心的创造性思维 (abstract and creative future-centric thinking)，如果它不是根植于具体 (concrete) 的东西，我的大脑就会拉响警报，我会说：“我需要一些具体 (concrete) 的东西。”所以如果你能给我一些具体的东西，我会更舒服。但在这一点上，我可能不得不更多地依赖信任 (trust)，信任 (trust) 可能是我替代同意 (agreement) 的选择，对吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\n是的。而且我想，我总是会认识到，嘿，我在这方面不是很擅长，让我督促自己对这些事情更开放，并寻找擅长此道的伙伴，让他们更多地掌舵 (drive the ship)。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:42:26):\n是的，这很棒。我们合作的 YC (Y Combinator) 团队最酷的一点是，他们非常老练和聪明。所以即使他们可能会遇到这个障碍 (roadblock)，A，他们会完全按照你刚才说的去做，他们会督促自己。你可能会在你的个人资料 (profile) 中注意到，你得分的那个点周围环绕着一些圆环，这些圆环代表了你督促自己以不同方式思考、超越你的大脑默认运作方式的难度。\n\n(00:42:55):\n现在，在某个时刻，你的大脑会崩溃，你会进入陌生领域 (foreign territory)。这里有一个程度问题，我的意思是，如果你是一个非常保守的人，而有人说：“我们去火人节 (Burning Man) 吧！”那会彻底颠覆你的思维。你不一定会完全走向光谱的另一端。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):\n声明一下，我去过四次，尽管我显然开放性 (openness) 较低。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:17):\n太棒了，而且去那里有很多理由。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):\n我在火人节 (Burning Man) 结的婚。这让我对自己开放性 (openness) 较低的百分位感觉好一些。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:25):\n但你正在拓展你的思维 (pushing your brain)。我的意思是，火人节 (Burning Man) 实际上是一个很好的例子，因为你去那里可能有很多不同的原因。如果你为了一个原因而去，那么你就会接触到其他原因。这可能会很有趣，你可能会更接近那些其他的原因。你可能会想，我将在更大的环境中待在自己的“理由泡沫” (reason bubble) 里。\n\n(00:43:44):\n所以有很多……商业也一样，你可以说，好吧，我要督促自己，我可能会进入超出我大脑灵活度 (brain's flexibility) 的地方，弹性带达到极限 (elastic band reaches its limits) 的地方，然后从那里我就会信任他人，我也会让人们……我本来想提 YC (Y Combinator) 创始人的一点是，他们中有很多人都非常聪明，他们能够非常高效地将你思维拓展范围 (band stretches) 之外的事物，快速转化为你感到舒服的语言。其他团队在这方面做得非常糟糕，他们只会指责你，“你为什么看不到呢？”然后你就会变得更加固步自封。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\n你看到人们有多大的转变？比如说他们做了这个测试，像我一样，开放性 (openness) 处于23百分位，你认为如果他们在这方面努力，他们会在这方面有显著的 (meaningfully) 提升吗？还是说，这只是你的本性，你不会有太大的改变？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:44:41):\n我个人更关心的是对团队的影响，而不是对个人的影响，因为如果你通过……我曾四次创业，如果我通过“我的公司运作得如何？我的团队运作得如何？”这个角度来看，我不需要所有个体都达到完美。我需要的是，特别是在存在沟通问题 (translation issue) 的情况下，当一个团队正在做某事，而团队的某一部分说：“让我们停在这里，让我们纠结于此。”如果他们能足够进步，以至于团队因此解脱 (freed up)，那才是我们作为企业真正感受到的。\n\n(00:45:23):\n所以直接回答你的问题，人们可以有很大的进步，特别是通过我们所描绘的那个范围的前三圈 (first three rings of that range that we depict)，非常非常好。自我意识 (Self-awareness) 实际上是关键。自我意识 (self-awareness) 和自我关注 (self-consciousness) 的区别在于，自我意识 (self-awareness) 仅仅是有意识地运用你的大脑 (intentional with your brain)，而自我关注 (self-consciousness) 则是担心你的大脑 (worried about your brain)。我们不希望人们担心自己的大脑，变得不自信 (insecure)，我们只是希望你说：“这是一种我的大脑可以这样运作的情况，而这是一种我想督促自己 (push myself) 的情况。”\n\n(00:45:56):\n所以，这是刻意为之的，我们在这个节目开始前也稍微聊过心智中本能与理智 (instinct versus intellect) 的二元对立 (duality)，本质上你只是用你的理智来验证或提升你的本能。你总会有关于风险、恐惧、不确定性、疑虑以及对数据需求的本能反应 (instinctive responses)，等等所有这些事情，但随后你的理智可以介入，观察你大脑的那个部分思考，然后说：“你对这个风险超级担心，但实际上我们跳进去尝试的风险是相当低的。”所以你想要稳定这种状况的需求有点不合时宜 (misplaced)，而你的理智，你真正做的就是说，“人们会改变多少？”我不太担心他们改变多少，更多的是他们能用理智发现与情况不符 (misfit) 的东西，然后把他们被驱使去做的事情和他们选择去做的事情区分开来。我们是否改变你的动机并不重要，如果你的行为选择 (choice of behavior) 和你的潜在动机 (underlying motivation) 可以彼此不同，那就太棒了，这样的人非常了不起。我们都认识这样的人，你会觉得，“我知道这个人现在很不舒服，但他们完全设法搞定了 (making it work)，我真的很欣赏这一点。”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):\n是的，我问这个的部分原因是，我们开始录音前我和你聊过，我希望在所有这些方面都达到99百分位 (99th percentile)，我就是想把它做好 (nail this)。我知道事情不是这样运作的，我知道你有优点，有缺点，你不可能在所有事情上都表现出色。但这很有趣，我的思绪会往这方面想。\n\n(00:47:28):\n关于如何提升愿景和战略 (vision and strategy) 的建议，为了做个总结，如果我回顾我听到的内容，那就是要非常清楚自己不擅长什么，比如开放性 (openness，指人格特质中的开放程度)。如果想搞清楚如何提升愿景和战略，开放性是否是需要特别关注的一点？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:47:46):\n所以有很多东西……嗯，让我试着把清单简化。开放性是最大的一点，因为它本质上是你对愿景和战略的容忍度 (tolerance)，开放性越低，你对这些抽象的 (abstract) 拼图块的容忍度就越低，这是肯定的。战略和愿景中那些古怪的 (outlandish)、纯粹的创意和打破规则的成分，缺乏先例 (lack of precedence) 等等。现在，另一件需要注意的是，当你的尽责性 (conscientiousness，指人格特质中的责任心、条理性) 提高时——这本质上是你追求高效、有成效、忙碌、不浪费时间的愿望。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):\n我在这方面得分很高。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:48:25):\n是的，有条理和有组织性，这也是一个负面因素。客观来说，做一个有尽责心的人是非常棒的，有很多好处，直到我们不得不富有成效地“浪费”时间 (waste time productively)，或者我们不得不打破组织中的秩序。然后，你每周四天或每月28天都很有用的那个优点，在那些我们去场外会议 (offsite) 并说“如果我们把一切都推翻了怎么办？”的日子里，就像你举的关于新设计、新网站的例子，把一切都推翻，重新开始，朝不同的方向发展，这时候尽责心就会想：“我们为什么要这样做？我们为什么要进行这次对话？有什么必要？这效率低下 (inefficient)，我本可以把时间花在其他事情上。”\n\n(00:49:09):\n有时这甚至会在会议中表现出来。有一次我在被收购后参加了一个会议，那已经是八九年前的事了。当你是一个创始人，你的公司被收购后，你会发现自己身处一个全新的环境 (habitat)，有着非常新的惯例 (rituals)。我经常遇到的一个惯例就是说：“我们不能一辈子都谈论这个。”我们大概在会议开始六分钟后，就会有人说出“我们不能一辈子都谈论这个”这句话。我就会看我的手表，然后想：“我没意识到你快要死了，我是说，如果你快要死了，你为什么还要参加这个会议？”\n\n(00:49:53):\n因为我的看法是，我们现在离“我们的一辈子”还远着呢，你为什么要说我们不能谈论某件事六分钟？当在会议的预热阶段 (priming) 增加信息的边际效益递减 (diminishing return of added information) 时——再用这个词，你了解X可以使你的决策质量提高四倍 (quadruples)，而你却在抵制了解X。现在我们将达到一个点，你了解Y、Z等等，我们已经达到了边际效益递减 (diminishing return)，现在我只将你的决策质量提高了1%，而不是4倍 (4x)。但是在这个房间里，我们还没有对增量思考 (incremental thought) 和增量信息 (incremental information) 的边际效益递减曲线 (diminishing return curve) 建立任何敏感度。这就像一个新的环境，我就会想，在这个环境里人们真的讨厌思考吗？人们真的认为自己是巡逻在知识分子世界“险恶街头” (mean streets of intellectualism) 的警察，对任何活动都进行监视吗？这有点疯狂。但这就是它的实际方面 (practical side)，你必须留意，你必须小心，这就是为什么我把环境看得如此重要，因为这是一个完美的例子：一个意图良好 (well-intentioned) 的房间，里面大部分人都是出于正确的理由和为了正确的结果而来的，但在那里，说出这样一句话的“常态”，或者说“我不同意”。同一个会议上有人说：“我完全不同意。”我就问：“所有事情都不同意吗？”“绝对所有的事情。”我就说，那我们来看看这个会议的元视角 (meta)，俯瞰视角 (overhead camera)。\n\n(00:51:33):\n这是战斗的开始，这就是大脑所看到的。房间里所有人的大脑都在想：“哦，打起来了，对吧？”现在我们的目标是什么？我的目标现在变成了胜利，他们的目标，因为他们冒了巨大的风险说“我不同意一切”，也变成了胜利。又因为他们不同意很多他们不理解的东西，必然结果是他们将在这个房间里被彻底击败 (annihilated)，他们都说过“我们不能永远谈论这个”，现在却把所有筹码都压上 (put all of their chips onto the table) 说“我完全不同意”，而不是说“我有一个问题”，或者“我们能深挖那个线索 (pull that thread) 吗？”或者“我不明白这些点是如何连接的。”\n\n(00:52:15):\n所以从一个超战术层面 (super tactical level) 来看，我们说的一些话会激活杏仁核 (amygdala，大脑中处理情绪，尤其是恐惧和攻击性的区域)，也就是大脑的战斗模式 (combat mode of the brain)，而选择不同的措辞则会激活前额叶皮层 (prefrontal cortex，大脑中负责理性思维、决策、计划的区域)，比如：“嘿，伦尼，你把这两个点连接起来了，我没看出来它们是如何连接的。”这是逻辑 (logic)。现在，我们用这句话来激活前额叶皮层，而不是说“伦尼，那很蠢，我完全不同意”，那样会激活杏仁核。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):\n我想谈谈你提出的这个关于环境的观点，我觉得这非常重要，但为了给战略和愿景部分做个总结 (close the loop)，给人们一些非常战术性的建议是：基本上要了解你的个性，也许可以做一下 CORE 身份测试 (CORE identity test) 或类似的东西，了解如果你在开放性 (openness) 方面得分低，而在尽责性 (conscientiousness) 方面得分高，也许你就不擅长愿景，宏观思考 (think big) 会让你觉得很难——\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:53:06):\n是的，你的大脑在接触愿景时会感到烦躁不安 (agitated)。但是，我的意思是，你仍然可以做到，对吧？你仍然可以请别人帮你“翻译”。关键的策略是，你不是注定会搞砸 (predestined to suck)，而是如果你开放性低，特别是如果你的尽责性也高，那么你就要认识到，你理解想法的“母语” (native language for ideas) 与愿景和真正优秀战略的“母语”是不匹配的 (mismatch)。\n\n(00:53:35):\n然后你可以对此持开放态度 (open about that)，你可以要求一些“翻译”，你可以要求……我的意思是，信任不一定意味着不参与 (non-participation)，你实际上可以说，“如果你能解释这个差距 (gap)，将有助于我建立信任。”一个很好的例子是二阶效应 (second order effect，指间接的、次要的影响)，我们为什么要拥有出色的文档？如果我们拥有出色的文档，我们如何赚更多的钱？这是一个很好的问题，提问的方式不要带有敌意 (hostile)，但只是帮助我理解，我们正在沿着哪条线索探索 (what thread are we pulling)？嗯，我们正在探索客户满意度、留存率、推荐等等这条线索。Stripe 在这方面做得非常好，尤其是在早期，优秀的文档证明了各种二阶效应的合理性，这些效应最终将引导我们达到你所询问的一阶效应 (first order effect，指直接的、主要的效应)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:20):\n太棒了，好的，这真的很棒。我本来想往一个方向走，但我想很快谈谈这个。这个播客中经常出现的一个话题是发挥优势 (leaning into strengths) 的力量，而不是觉得你必须在所有事情上都表现出色。在这个例子中，我开放性低，尽责性高，但我仍然可以在这个角色中非常成功，在我看来，通过发挥我真正擅长的东西，比如尽责性，而且我的宜人性 (agreeableness，指人格特质中的友好、合作程度) 也高。我不喜欢那样说。你觉得如果你的开放性低，你不擅长愿景也没关系，但你可以在其他方面做得更好，而且无论你的个性如何，你们在一起都能非常成功，对此有什么看法？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:55:03):\n完全正确，是的。我的意思是，事实是，我们看看 Canva 例子中的教练和经理，这不仅改变了员工对他们被投入的这种联系的感受，而且也本质上改变了很多会议动态 (meeting dynamics) 和团队协作动态 (teaming dynamics)，从等级森严 (hierarchical) 的管理方式转向更基于网络的智力 (mesh based intellect)。在这样的网络中，你不再需要过多担心层级结构。你可以说，这就是我贡献的性质。\n\n(00:55:39):\n所以，即使在愿景和战略部分，你对创意生成 (idea generation) 的贡献可能也会有一些，而且它们可能还不错。但这些想法并不是在你提出时需要保护的想法，它们是放在桌上，让大家可以围过来改进它们。然后，当其他人贡献一些对你来说不那么自然的想法时，你只需要意识到我们还没有到评判 (judging)、排序 (ranking) 和优先处理 (prioritizing) 这些想法的阶段，这并不是我们在整个故事线 (overall storyline) 中的位置。所以让它发生，然后如果你能改进这些想法，就去改进它们。\n\n(00:56:15):\n一旦想法有了早期阶段，就像乔纳森·艾维 (Jony Ive) 所描述的“想法的萌芽期 (infancy of an idea)”，当它非常脆弱、微妙和易受影响时，如果你能将这个想法培养到青少年时期，让它具备一定的自我保护能力，那么你现在就处于一个情境中，你的尽责性 (conscientiousness) 就可以开始思考诸如我们如何为这个项目提供资源 (resource)？什么排序 (sequencing) 最合理？这些东西相对于彼此的投资回报率 (ROI, Return on Investment) 是多少？并考虑二阶效应 (second order effects) 和三阶效应 (third order effects) 等等。项目计划会是怎样的？就你所说的，兼具尽责性和宜人性，你天生就是协调 (coordination) 和对齐 (alignment) 的大师。\n\n(00:56:56):\n所以当项目的那个阶段开始，我们需要让人们接受 (bought in)，高效协作 (high functioning together)，达成共识 (getting on the same page)，保持专注，完成项目时，所有那些一开始在愿景和战略方面表现出色的人，在那个阶段简直就是一场彻底的灾难 (complete disaster)。现实世界中事情就是这样运作的，我想我们又是如此专注，就像我们一开始谈到的，我们暗示了你必须解构 (unpack) 足够的复杂性。我喜欢爱因斯坦的名言：“尽可能地简单，但不要过于简单 (Make things as simple as possible but no simpler)”，而我们在商业中把事情简化得远超可能，通过说这就是做整件事的正确方式。\n\n(00:57:41):\n这就像，不，不，不，如果你曾在现实生活中真正构建过一个产品，那么在产品生命周期（product life cycle）的整个过程中，动态变化（dynamics shift）会非常大，任何生命周期也都是如此。随着动态变化，那些表现出色的人（peak humans）也会非常不同。比如，Lenny 在这里表现出色，贡献了 10%，而在这里贡献了 98%。Evan 在这里贡献了 98%，当涉及这些会议时，请让 Evan 离开房间，这太棒了。是的，我们应该发挥我们的长处，但不能因此而不知道自己的弱点，因为团队中其他人的长处可以弥补你弱点的“漏洞”（bug）。我们公司里运行着“有缺陷的软件”（buggy software），然后我们说：“哦，我正在发挥我的长处，我不需要担心我的弱点。”那么你就会变成一个需要将所有事情都翻译成你自己的语言的人，因为当你的弱点暴露时，它会拖慢其他所有人的速度。\n\n(00:58:41):\n所以，从运营（operations）和业务流畅性（business fluidity）的角度来看，一个高度不了解自身弱点的团队，将会因此而面临很多迟缓和问题。他们不必解决所有的弱点，但要意识到它们，并知道谁能弥补你的弱点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nEvan，这太有趣了。我喜欢我们深入探讨这个问题。你有没有一个战术性的建议（tactical thing），可以帮助一个人在集思广益（brainstorming）或制定愿景（vision）时，或者在开放性（openness）方面表现不佳时（比如我），变得更好？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:59:13):\n我认为对于一个认真负责的人（conscientious person）来说，要想变得更开放，最好的练习就是痴迷于“逆向工程”（reverse engineering）。我的意思是，我认为这里有两种形式的逆向工程非常有用。第一种是针对期望结果进行逆向工程（reverse engineering against a desired outcome），以真正理解产生该结果的“输入”（inputs）。如果我们从宏观层面考虑，比如，我们想赢得市场，那么有哪些真正的输入可以解构这个结果，并理解我们的战略应该如何设计，才能应对所有产生该结果的最相关输入？我认为这是一种特定的形式。\n\n(00:59:55):\n然后在一个非常战术性的层面（super tactical level），如果你想给某人反馈（feedback），比如说，我这个人礼貌程度较低，你可能比我礼貌得多，我多年来在提供反馈时，都很难产生预期的结果。我确实给出了反馈，但我的表达方式（delivery）并非预期结果，我传递反馈的方式实际上降低了预期结果的可能性，因为我在很多情况下都过于无礼、过于直接、过于严厉。严厉对大脑有什么影响？这显而易见。所以我所做的与科学已知的情况大相径庭，这就是我在那些情况下失败的原因。\n\n(01:00:35):\n但当我开始弥合差距并意识到我需要更努力地思考这次反馈的故事线（story arc）时，当我心中明确了反馈的预期结果，即我真心希望这个人能在这个特定的思维方式上有所转变时，我就最清楚该怎么做了。如果你我一起工作，并且谈论的是开放性，我们可能会说，我现在能做些什么来逐步提高（increment）并为随着时间推移，你在开放性方面所接受的巨大转变（big shift）做好铺垫？那就是一种，如果我不礼貌地说：“Lenny，你有什么问题？你为什么做不到这个？其他人都能做到。”\n\n(01:01:13):\n你开始做出这种转变的意愿，我的意思是，它可能存在，安全系统（safety system）被激活了，比如，哦，如果我不这样做，可能会发生不好的事情，但我不希望你的安全系统来驱动这种改变。我的意思是，在大多数情况下，那是一种基于表面现象的改变（optics based change），而非会发生的实质性改变（material change）。这就是为什么很多人，比如“问责制”（accountability）就是一个很好的例子，要求问责制是得不到问责制的最好方式，因为要求问责制会激活人们的安全系统，特别是当你说：“我要追究人们的责任。”于是大家会想，哦，太棒了，我们应该搭建一个全是门面房屋的电影布景，假装一切都很好，但背后没有任何实质内容，这就是为什么这么多公司最终会变成那样。但是的，我会说这就是战术。\n\n(01:01:58):\n关于开放性和逆向工程（reverse engineering），需要理解的第二件事就是“情境感知”（situational awareness）。我个人认为，作为一个非常开放的人，很少有认真负责的人能花足够的时间沉浸在日常工作所需的情境感知（situational awareness）的现实中。最简单的例子是，有多少高管（executives）曾与 N 个（N 大于 5）以上的客户交谈过？这是一个...因为，嗯，我很忙。我有很多事情要做，我没有时间去环游世界，这就像我们没有余生来谈论这件事。我不是要求你去环游世界，我要求你将足够的情境感知（situational awareness）植入你的大脑，以便你每天做出的那些影响你没有与之交谈的所有人的决定，都能考虑到那些你没有与之交谈的人。\n\n(01:02:49):\n所以在这种情况下，重点不在于预期的特定结果，而更多在于，我是否真正了解……我会这样思考，如果我们考虑航空工程（aeronautical engineering），我是否真的了解我每天所处的环境、飞行条件（flight conditions），以便能够飞得很好？对于很多人来说，答案是否定的。所以逆向工程（reverse engineering）可能是一个完整的范畴。我不知道这是否足够具有战术意义（tactical sense），我很乐意提供更多描述，但这就是我认为的范畴：你是否已经通过逆向工程（reverse engineered）了解了如何获得结果，你是否通过逆向工程（reverse engineered）使你的思维倾向于产生真正好的想法和好的决策，而不是产生那些与现实严重脱节的决策。\n\n(01:03:37):\n一个很好的例子是 PLG（Product-Led Growth，产品驱动增长），我的意思是，如果你没有做足够的情境感知（situational awareness）工作，你根本不知道 PLG 是否是一种远程可行的业务增长策略。它是否是一种远程相关的业务增长策略。一家又一家公司，其领导团队都痴迷于这样一个理念：原则上我们应该能够让人们直接注册、刷信用卡、完成入职，然后一切顺利。不，我们有一个高度技术化的解决方案，这永远不会发生，或者他们不是那样做预算的，或者有任何其他可能导致它行不通的原因，这些都只是一些具体例子。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\n本期节目由 Eppo 赞助。Eppo 是一个下一代 A/B 测试和功能管理平台（AB testing and feature management platform），由 Airbnb 和 Snowflake 的校友为现代增长团队（modern growth teams）打造。Twitch、Miro、ClickUp 和 DraftKings 等公司都依赖 Eppo 来支持他们的实验。实验对于驱动增长和理解新功能表现变得越来越重要，Eppo 帮助您提高实验速度（experimentation velocity），同时以其他商业工具无法做到的方式实现严谨的深度分析（rigorous deep analysis）。\n\n(01:04:49):\n当我在 Airbnb 工作时，我最喜欢的事情之一就是我们的实验平台（experimentation platform），在那里我可以轻松地设置实验、解决问题并独立分析性能。Eppo 做到这一切，甚至更多，它拥有先进的统计方法（advanced statistical methods），可以帮助你缩短数周的实验时间，以及易于访问的用户界面（accessible UI），用于深入分析性能，并提供开箱即用的报告（out of the box reporting），帮助你避免烦人的漫长分析周期（prolonged analytic cycles）。Eppo 还让你能够轻松与团队分享实验洞察（experiment insights），为 A/B 测试飞轮（AB testing flywheel）激发新想法。Eppo 为各种用例（use case）提供实验支持，包括产品（product）、增长（growth）、机器学习（machine learning）、变现（monetization）和电子邮件营销（email marketing）。请访问 geteppo.com/Lenny 了解 Eppo，并让你的实验速度提升 10 倍。网址是 geteppo.com/Lenny。\n\n(01:05:38):\n感觉有很多像“分形”（fractal）一样的话题可以聊，有无数条线索我想深入探讨。让我稍微转向“影响力”（influence）这个话题，我们之前稍微提到了这一点。我知道你在如何培养提升影响力（influential）的技能方面有很多很棒的建议，这是很多播客听众、产品经理（product managers）以及创始人（founders）都需要的一项技能。谁不需要成为更好的影响者呢？我们能从中学到什么来成为更好的影响者？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:06:05):\n我们可能在一开始就会展开第二个话题，并在这里开辟一条支线，但有两件事：一个是影响力本身，另一个是关系（relationships），我们可能需要稍微谈谈关系。试图通过一种“功能失调的关系”（dysfunctional relationship）施加影响力是不会有好结果的。大多数人，尤其是在工作时，在处理人际关系（relationships）方面都相当不适应。\n\n(01:06:36):\n你甚至会听到一些疯狂的口头禅，比如我们必须互相合作，这就像，祝你好运吧。我的意思是，你只需观察一下一个不喜欢你的人手机上弹出的短信，看看他们对短信、或者他们的 Slack 消息等的回复时间。我的意思是，你谈论的是，你纯粹因为关系不好，就导致了至少数小时、甚至数天的响应延迟，然后你将这种影响叠加到你的公司规模上。这仅仅因为我不想现在回复 Evan，就造成了巨大的运营效率低下（operational inefficiency）。所以这是一方面。\n\n(01:07:19):\n现在假设关系已经到位（我们稍后会回来讨论，因为有一个非常可操作的框架可以展开），假设关系良好，我认为影响力的起点是选择你的角色（character）和选择你的模式（mode）。这就像你在玩《艾尔登法环》（Elden Ring）或其他视频游戏，你会想，我是要作为英雄或这些事物的典范来影响他，还是通过“幕后渠道”（back channels）来影响？我的角色是什么？每个人的个性都有一个自然的契合点，来选择你作为这种影响力模式的角色，然后你将选择一个影响速度，即慢速、中速或快速。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:08:00):\n然后你将选择一个影响速度，即慢速、中速或快速。“环境”（habitat）可以在这方面提供很大帮助。如果有创始人正在听这段内容，而你没有创造一个能够轻松实现快速影响力的环境，并且没有给出相应的权限，那么你就是在无意中通过不向团队澄清这一点而减慢了公司的速度。所以慢速影响是那种“我们会让他们自己吃苦头”的影响。他们正在走向悬崖，我们知道他们正在走向悬崖。很多时候，我们都会发现自己陷入了所谓的“阿比林悖论”（Abilene paradox）。\n\n(01:08:39):\n阿比林悖论（Abilene paradox）是指房间里的每个人都知道这是一个坏主意，但我们都说：“我们加入。”如果你在 Google 上搜索关于阿比林悖论（Abilene paradox）的经典迷因（memes），它可能会是这样的：爸爸认为孩子们可能想去露营。妈妈不想去露营，孩子们也不想去露营。爸爸其实也不想去露营，但每个人都想：“爸爸可能想让我们去露营，所以我们试试看吧。”然后他们都去了，但都不喜欢。我们总是看到这种情况发生。\n\n(01:09:09):\n很多人会说：“我什么都做不了。在这种情况下我没有任何影响力。我们只会让他失败，然后他们就会学到教训。”或者像我这样过去几年里反馈方式不当、不懂礼貌的人，我不会让埃文坐下来和他谈论这件事。他会通过失败自己发现这样做行不通。而这可能需要几个月、几年，甚至人们一辈子才能以这种缓慢的方式学到。这是一种影响力 (influence) 的形式。你刻意地说，我认为世界会制造足够的失败，从而促使适应发生。这是一种影响力，只是最慢的一种。\n\n(01:09:48):\n很多听众可能意识到：“哦，我就是这么做的。我怎样才能比仅仅让事情失败更快呢？”所以这就是适度影响力 (moderate influence) 的用武之地。要了解适度影响力，一本很好的书是《挑战者销售法》 (The Challenger Sale)。在《挑战者销售法》中，我们关注的是教人们一些东西的概念。然后当他们带着这些新知识生活时，他们会看到以前从未看到过的东西。举个例子，我们可以反复使用这个反馈的例子，比如：“嘿，埃文，当你说这些话的时候，你可能需要注意人们的肢体语言，这里有一些迹象可以注意，当你这样做并得到这个反应时，这可能表明人们已经接受并仍然支持你。而当你看到这个时，这可能表明人们正在抵触。”\n\n(01:10:37):\n你可以在那一刻提出这个问题，你可能会听到这样的答案。所以你就像给了某人一个工具，他们的未来将因此展开。《挑战者销售法》有点假设销售周期 (sales cycle) 足够长，你不会在会议中完成销售，你不会试图当场成交。你会教他们一些东西，然后你会说：“嘿，如果你看到这些迹象，那就是一个相当明确的信号，表明你需要采取行动。所以我们为什么不在30天后给你打电话呢？”30天后我们打电话，“嘿，你一直看到这些吗？”他们会说：“我到处都看到，现在我根本无法忽视它们了。”\n\n(01:11:13):\n这就是你如何在几天、几周，最坏情况下几个月内影响一个人，这比让他们自己失败要快得多。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\n我们实际上请过，我不知道你知不知道，那本书的作者，马特·迪克森 (Matt Dixon)，我想他叫这个名字，他上过我们的播客。《挑战者销售法》的核心思想是挑战他们的视角和他们对市场真实情况以及他们所需之物的看法。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:11:36):\n没错。是的。我认为，虽然其中有挑战的成分，但我认为这种方法论中被低估的一点是，你仍然让那个人看到世界，但你给了他们新的信息，这些信息正在打破他们大脑中某种固化 (calcification) 的挑战。并不是在挑战的那一刻所有奇迹都发生了。之后还会出现一些时刻，这些时刻会持续将那种钙、石灰和铁锈溶解剂 (calcium, lime and rust melting formula) 应用到他们心中的这种预期或这种决定上，直到有时他们会转过身来说：“谢谢你告诉我这些。”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\n所以这里的建议是，如果你想影响某人，试着找出他们不知道什么。找到你认为他们可能不知道的信息，因为一旦他们知道了，他们可能会说：“哦，哇，我完全明白你在说什么了。”\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:12:33):\n是的，完全正确。让他们知道，让他们消化。不要强行灌输给他们，让他们被迫接受。如果他们只是稍微消化一下，哪怕只是几天，也可能足以让他们回到一个更温和的对话中。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\n这和你之前说的，我很喜欢“选择一个角色”，比如根据你的个性选择你的影响力风格，无论是“幕后渠道” (back channeling)——这让我想起一个非常特定的人，他实际上会来上播客，他就像一个绝地武士 (Jedi)，总能让人们达成一致，但却非常低调，总是在会议之前的会议上做工作。所以那是一种角色，或者只是在演示文稿 (deck) 中讲述一个引人入胜的故事。或者还有其他角色，我想。分享信息的这个想法，它是一种角色类型，还是只是一种每个人都应该做的非常有效的策略？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:13:27):\n我喜欢凡事都带着“意图性” (intentionality) 的想法。我们是在让信风 (trade winds) 把我们推向某些事物，还是我们真的在做选择？我认为，对自己的风格以及这种角色概念保持意图性是明智的一步，这样你就可以在进行过程中有一些护栏 (guardrails) 和一致性。这有助于其他人理解你在影响力中扮演的角色。如果你始终如一地以同一种方式行事，你就是那种风格，比如我想通过这种方式来影响这个组织，你会一遍又一遍地在我身上看到这一点。\n\n(01:14:07):\n你有点给了自己一些许可，而且你也可以获得人们的认同 (buy-in)。如果你想采取更像“野蛮人” (barbarian) 的方式，你可以说：“嘿，我采取的是‘魔鬼代言人’ (devil's advocate) 的方式，或者我就是那种用大锤狠狠敲打，看看它还能不能站住脚的人。”如果我一遍又一遍地这样做可以吗？现在你已经为未来的自己赢得了以某些方式处理事情的许可，这些方式会带来截然不同的影响力结果，比如意义深远的差异。我能够做到这一点，并且它加速了某些事情。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\n所以我理解的是，有很多方法可以实现你的目标，思考你的个性风格，并找到最符合你运作方式的路径。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:14:52):\n没错。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):\n无论是幕后操作，还是讲述一个引人入胜的故事。太棒了。所以这个角色基本上就是弄清楚你的……这又回到了利用你的优势，你擅长什么？然后利用这个渠道去说服人们相信你希望他们相信的事情。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:08):\n是的，绝对正确。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):\n我在打开游戏并选择角色时，脑海中会浮现：有哪些方法？这个列表中有哪些角色选项？你提到了一些，但能否分享一个简短的列表，让人们知道，哦，好的，我明白了，我可以用这种方式尝试施加影响力。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:27):\n也许“维度” (dimensions) 对人们来说最有价值。我会说其中一个维度是“同情心” (compassion)，也就是说，我是否想通过帮助他人来施加影响，确保我们做对事情，并让人们获得价值。那么我在那里寻求的许可是，我是否可以提出这样的问题：我们现在为什么不考虑用户？我们为什么不关心他们正在获得的价值，并以这种方式来挑战我们？\n\n(01:15:59):\n我认为有些角色是基于逻辑甚至信念的，也就是说，我希望成为那个在对话中注入更多知识和更多“因果关系” (causality) 的人，并在对话中挑战因果关系，以使我们更深入地思考，挑战我们的信念，打破我们带着进入会议的那些“神圣不可侵犯的观念” (sacred cows)，这样我们走出会议时对事情会有不同的感受。\n\n(01:16:27):\n所以我认为有很多非常不同的有用维度。其中一个可能非常基于创造力 (creativity)。如果你遵循这种“大五人格” (Big Five) 格式，它们基本上都为你列出来了。热情 (enthusiasm)，一个有趣的维度。我想通过“人们对什么感到兴奋？什么让人们感觉良好？这会让人感觉良好吗？”的视角来挑战我们。我们能对产品或这个营销活动等做些什么调整吗？看看西基 (Siki) 刚刚用 Runway (一个公司或产品名) 做了什么。我的意思是，我太喜欢那个人了，他的性格中有很多组成部分，显然他周围的人也贡献了真正更高层次的东西。他们绝对是在利用同情心这些维度互相挑战，以扮演照顾者 (caregiver) 或保护者 (protector) 的角色。所以有很多不同的方式可以将这些维度转化为角色。\n\n(01:17:28):\n但我认为，当你看到这些视角各自的价值时，尤其是在产品领域，我非常喜欢产品。如果你拥有异常高的同情心 (compassion)，异常高的开放性 (openness)，你就会有内在的奖励和动力去探索其他思维不那么直观探索的产品领域。你不必拥有完整的“牌组” (deck) 就能在产品方面表现出色。但如果你天生就非常倾向于“逆向工程” (reverse engineering)，你就会有一些不公平的优势。你将更具“情境意识” (situational awareness)，并且可能会做出比那些情境意识远不如你的团队好得多的决策。这是一个巨大的优势。\n\n(01:18:16):\n但谈到影响力这个概念。我的意思是，弄清楚这些定义你自己的维度，然后利用它们来说：“我希望得到许可，提出一系列问题，并通过我这种非常直观的优势来挑战我们的思维。”我们都能看到其中的价值吗？还是我需要进一步推销自己？然后你会发现你可以扮演好那个角色。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\n我想，最终的突破是将其与那个人的个性风格以及他们接收信息的最佳方式结合起来，这有点困难。因为你不能强迫他们参加一些测试，也不能让他们把结果给你。但我知道很多团队会一起做这些测试，并分享结果。所以我想这只是一个提醒，如果你和你的团队，尤其是公司的管理层 (execs)，这样做会非常强大。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:19:09):\n是的，没错。当你从你的三种选择状态进入这种“脆弱性” (vulnerability) 时，我们不需要大量数据也能很好地发挥作用。如果你说：“嘿，我不太擅长这个，”而房间里其他人会说，“等等，这个人在这方面非常棒，你们两个为什么不一起合作呢？”那么就像在30秒内，我们就释放了原本不存在的潜力。\n\n(01:19:34):\n所以你想开展业务……我有点想扩展这个电子游戏的比喻。我们不仅选择我们的角色，或者我们本身就是某个角色，而且企业有一个“难度设置” (difficulty setting)，这是我们根据环境 (habitat) 选择的。我曾在太多公司工作过，也与太多公司合作过，我们在“噩梦模式” (nightmare) 下玩游戏，每个敌人都需要一千发霰弹枪子弹才能击倒，而不是简单地将难度设置切换到“简单模式” (easy)，那样敌人在我们经历这个旅程时不知怎么就变成了我们的朋友。\n\n(01:20:06):\n我的意思是，它真的可以如此具有变革性，尤其是在像你提到的那种情况下。好的，我的“开放性” (openness) 不那么高。我的“尽责性” (conscientiousness) 非常高。如果我能承认这一点并提出不同类型的问题，房间里的其他人就会觉得这个事情的难度设置一下子降到了零，速度也比以前快得多。\n\n(01:20:32):\n我们低估了商业世界中这种不太具体的部分。我的意思是，这就是我当初疯狂到创办这家公司的全部缘起，在此之前我也创办过其他公司。我们正在低估我们运营现实 (operational reality) 有多少是人类现实 (human reality) 的反映。我们做得足够好吗？我们正在做正确的事情来弥合科学所知与商业实践之间的差距吗？我们甚至知道科学是什么吗？我们是否已经自我教育，以弥合这个差距？然后一切变得非常明显，哦，保持开放并找到解决我“bug”（程序错误/问题）的补丁，这很有道理。就是这样。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\n这个话题的“分形”（fractal，指在不同尺度下都能展现出相似结构的几何形状，这里指话题分支和复杂化）仍在继续增长。我正努力控制它。在接下来的谈话中，我想尝试谈论三件事，我们已经触及过这些内容，我认为它们对人们会非常有用。第一是关系。你提到还有更多关于如何建立良好关系的内容。第二是我想回到“栖息地”（habitat），建立一个非常有利于创新、速度和成功的栖息地。然后我想谈谈专注。我们谈论过专注的重要性以及我们大脑在不同专注状态下运作方式的差异。所以也许我们从关系这个部分开始，因为它与我们刚才谈论的如何加强团队内部关系、建立更好的关系有关。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:21:53):\n是的，所以我们谈论关系时，把它看作是“影响力”（influence）的一个出口 (off ramp) 或一个侧翼 (sidecar)。很快地，影响力的“快速模式”和关系非常契合。我们谈论了慢速和中速模式。影响力的快速模式是“认知失调”（cognitive dissonance，指个体在同一时间拥有心理上不一致的两种或多种认知时所产生的不适感）。它本质上是在当下说，我不会等你体验任何东西。它是在当下说，这个公式 (formula) 是如何计算的？埃文，向我解释一下，你直言不讳的反馈是如何让一个人改变的。你为什么相信这一点？\n\n(01:22:29):\n特别是第二句话，“你为什么相信这一点？”深入探究行为背后的信念。你相信什么让你做出这种行为？然后我们就可以探讨这个信念本身有多么荒谬，这就会浮现到表面。\n\n(01:22:47):\n如果在环境（“栖息地”是其中一个重要组成部分，我们的关系也是）中，你们有着良好的人际关系，人们之间有足够的信任来进行这种“认知失调”的对话，并且我们的“栖息地”非常明确，我们可以自由讨论“认知失调”和逻辑脱节，这做起来非常重要。那样你基本上就激活了快速影响力模式。所以这是一个非常重要的事情。然后当你转向关系时，嗯，什么是……在我看来，每个人都一带而过的问题是：什么是关系？我不知道你对回答这个问题有何看法，但它真的很难——\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\n我只会去问 ChatGPT。“什么是关系？”\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:23:33):\n没错，是的。现在我们有一些过去没有的帮助。但除了“什么是关系”之外，另一个伴随的问题是，“我与X的关系有多好？”比如，你和我都认识 Shreyas，我们之间的关系有多好？我会说棒极了。为什么棒极了？我不知道。感觉很棒。所以让我们深入探讨一个好的定义和一个好的框架，因为一旦你真正知道为什么一段关系感觉很好，或者为什么一段关系感觉异常困难，我们现在就可以开始为它们制定一些策略，一些实际的行动计划。\n\n(01:24:14):\n所以我们向人们提出的建议是，如果你把大脑能力的第三个组成部分——那就是你关系的一部分，特别是你的职业关系。如果你认识一位工程师，你有一个想建造的想法，而他有能力建造它，他的能力和对你的“效用”（utility）是你们关系的函数，它将对你在这段关系中感受到的积极或消极力量做出贡献。比如，哇，这个人能力很强。我的欣赏程度更高，我对他们的信任度更高，我与他们的合作度更高。\n\n(01:24:50):\n如果你质疑一个人的能力，或者他们已经证明能力有些不可靠，这些事情就会开始向下发展。我们以 Shreyas 为一个好例子？因为我想大多数观看的人也认识他。他的能力是什么？他的“效用”是什么？是我见过最高的。我的意思是，每一次对话，他在智力上和概念上都能提供增益。每次与他交谈后，你都会变得更好。至少这是我与他的经验。\n\n(01:25:20):\n我们都认识这样的人，在各个领域和各种能力上。所以这是非常重要的一部分。作为个体，为什么投资于你的能力如此重要，因为它与你拥有的每段关系，特别是职业关系，都息息相关。你的能力、知识、推理、想象力、技能组合，这些都是你可增长的方面 (incrementable facets)。\n\n(01:25:50):\n这真的非常非常关键。现在这里有个剧情反转 (plot twist)。从生物学角度来说，你的能力实际上并不是关系中最重要的部分。还有两个更重要的因素。令人惊讶的结局是，第三个因素最重要，这在某些情况下有点吓人。\n\n(01:26:11):\n关系的第二个因素是信任。那么，大脑中的信任。如果我们回到我们之前谈到的非常原始的杏仁核 (amygdala)，信任简单来说就是风险。人类层面的风险和信任在一段关系中可以从强烈负面到强烈正面。我们与生活中不同的人都感受过这种完整的范围。强烈负面的信任是大脑在说，这个人对我来说很危险。他们很可能会试图暗中破坏我。他们很可能无法交付某些东西。通过与这段关系的互动，本质上会发生个人伤害。\n\n(01:26:51):\n而在信任的另一方面，我们试图为此设定一些层次来保持清晰。话题的分形仍在继续增长，但我们会尽量简化。但我喜欢将信任分为一、二、三级。三个不同的信任级别。信任一级是，假设我们正在举办烧烤聚会。信任一级是，Lenny，你能带上薯片吗，最好是密封的。这是一种简单、非关键任务的委派，知道它很可能会完成，而且完成得不错。但这不是一个非常高的信任级别。我们和同事一起工作时，这种委派，尤其是那些以“我想做高价值的工作，所以把低价值的工作交给别人”为前提进行委派的人，那些都是我们交给别人的低价值工作，它允许我们纯化我们的专注点在那些高价值的工作上，我们不需要所有低价值的工作都完美无缺或极富艺术性。\n\n(01:27:53):\n所以信任二级是当我们升级到几乎像“我需要自己做这件事。有没有人能像我一样做好？”那种由他们来做而不是我来做不会有任何风险的感觉。这就是你获得团队真正可扩展性 (scalability) 的地方。所以如果你能足够信任别人，你的大脑对将这项任务交给别人或甚至将这些知识交给别人，他们会像你一样对待它的风险评估，那是你能在一段关系中感受到的显著更高的积极信任。\n\n(01:28:26):\n最后，信任三级是当我们的大脑达到这些“断点”（breakpoints），我们会说，你思考问题的方式超越了我在这个话题上的思考方式。所以烧烤聚会上的经典例子是，如果沃尔夫冈·帕克（Wolfgang Puck，著名厨师）是邻居，我们会让沃尔夫冈·帕克来做所有最关键的事情，甚至可能包括布置音乐和装饰等等。或者另一个例子是，当史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格（Steven Spielberg）让约翰·威廉姆斯（John Williams）为电影配乐时，他并不是希望约翰能像史蒂文自己一样做好。他是在说：“把账单寄给我。尽量别太离谱。”但他不会坐下来拿着发票说：“你为什么需要13把号角而不是11把？”约翰就是做他该做的事，因为这种超越我“事件视界”（event horizon，物理学概念，指黑洞边界，这里指认知范围）的风险有如此多的信任。我来做比他来做（或她来做）风险更大，对吗？\n\n(01:29:25):\n所以这就是这个层次，但这对于一个人来说更重要，因为如果安全系统被激活，你的“效用”就丧失了。所以如果你是一位很棒的工程师，但你伤害了别人，你是不是很棒的工程师都不重要了，因为在你的组织的社交网络 (social network) 中，你是一个周围有保护层的节点 (node)。信息不会像通常那样流向你，委派不会流向你，访问也不会像通常那样流向你。所以你在此时此刻是一个受到保护、已停用、被隔离的网络节点。很多人真的不明白这一点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\n是的，那是一种非常好的可视化方式。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:30:16):\n然后这就是令人惊讶的结局。你拥有的每段关系的最后一部分是“吸引力”（appeal，指一个人给他人带来的正面感受和愉悦体验）。“吸引力”是你大脑如何解释你与他人共享的经历。你是否期待与那个人相处，你是否喜欢他们的风格，以及共享经历的真实感受。如果你想想，让我们最后一次以 Shreyas 为例。他的能力和“效用”是什么？超乎寻常。他能在多大程度上被信任？信任三级，超乎寻常。他会伤害别人吗？我的意思是，据我所知不会。他可能有我们不知道的非常黑暗的过去，但据我所见，他并没有造成多少伤害。第三，他会带来什么样的体验？他是一个极其积极的体验。所以他自然而然地不断建立起一段又一段良好的关系。\n\n(01:31:15):\n再说一次，如果你是那位能力出众的优秀工程师，现在我们反转中间的维度。我们非常信任你，但你是个糟糕透顶的体验。你会来我们的团建 (offsite) 吗？你会参加这个会议吗？不，你离开了。我们不希望你在那里。你就像一场飓风。所以从生物学角度来说，在我们把这转移到商业语境 (business context) 中时，我们程序中最大的“bug”（缺陷）是，在商业中最有意义的是，如果这是一个“精英管理制度”（meritocracy，指人才和能力是晋升主要标准的制度），那么最优秀、知识最渊博、我们最能信任的人应该在场，但如果他们带来糟糕的体验，我们就会竭尽全力去抵抗。这真是令人沮丧。有趣的是，你可以反转它。我们都有朋友，或者认识一些有朋友的人，这些人你无法信任，他们没有什么值得一提的能力，但他们带来超棒的体验。多么好的朋友啊。\n\n(01:32:16):\n所以我们怎么会把这个事情完全搞反了呢？我想这就是关键。当你分析那份清单时，当任何听众分析那份清单时，关键是问“我是什么样的体验？”那才是开始的地方。不是“我的工作做得有多好？”“我知道多少？”“我对这个过程有多关键？”而是“我是否带来糟糕透顶的体验？”如果答案是肯定的，那么暂时不要太担心其他方面，你必须先解决这个问题。\n\n(01:32:48):\n谈到个人特质 (profile) 这一点，当你分析这些特质时，你会发现一些显然不愉快的经历，比如非常不礼貌，这显然不是一种愉快的经历；比如过度强势和专横，这显然也不是一种愉快的经历；比如开放性极低 (hyper low in openness)，并基于此行事，一直告诉所有人他们把一切都搞复杂了。对于那些真心实意想把事情做对的人来说，这不是一个很好的体验。因此，有了这些知识，你可以做一些具体的事情。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\n最后这一点让我想起为什么一些最有效的 产品经理 (PMs) 是那些能给团队带来巨大能量和积极性，并能激发大家热情的人，这是一种软技能 (soft skill)，但对你的团队来说却是一种非常强大的力量，因为人们会期待你来领导他们。我曾与一位产品经理合作，每次开会他都会说：“这会很棒的！”他每次开会都会直接进来，说：“哦，谁准备好做决定了？”这真的改变了一切。所以，这是一个非常棒的建议。\n\n(01:33:46):\n所以基本上，如果你想要更好的人际关系，这会让你成为一个更好的有影响力的人 (influencer)，那么就从思考“我给人带来什么样的体验？”开始，当人们与我合作、向我寻求帮助、向我提问时。你分享了很多具体可以做的事情。\n\n(01:34:03):\n我总是告诉人们的一点是，试着微笑，看起来开心就好。这会带来很大的不同。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:07):\n看起来开心。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):\n带来能量，看起来开心。努力保持兴奋。是的，所以如果你想建立更好的人际关系，这将带来所有这些惊人的涓滴效应 (trickle down effects)，你的建议是思考当人们与你合作时，你给他们带来的体验是什么，致力于建立信任，并理想情况下达到第三个层次，即你做得比他们更好。但这对于所有事情来说都是一个高标准 (high bar)。最后一点是，你真的令人惊叹吗？在你的能力上下功夫，这是最后一部分。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:38):\n是的，没错。这并不是说这些都不重要，因为其他的都是某种意义上的“途径 (gateways)”。我的意思是，你的人际关系需要这三者，尤其是你的职业关系。所以，是的，这更像是如果你的个人体验 (experience) 是唯一削弱 (undermining) 你的因素，而你本身非常值得信赖，技能娴熟且有能力，那真是太可惜了。只要改正它就好。\n\n(01:35:03):\n有很多方法可以做到这一点。但我喜欢让人们去创造性地探索，比如“哦天哪，好吧，我可以把这个改变成这样”。关于信任，你伤害过别人吗？我的意思是，就是这样。人们是否有理由相信你具有风险或危险？不幸的是，在许多组织环境 (habitat) 中，环境本身要么允许，甚至奖励那些非常不可信的人在系统内部玩弄权术。当你和 Jeffrey 谈论权力对话时，组织环境越糟糕，他的建议就越有效。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\n我能理解。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:35:49):\n他之所以正确，是因为他用了一个短语：“世界一直如此，现在如此，未来也将如此。”嗯，这是常态化的失能世界 (normal dysfunctional world) 一直如此，现在如此，未来也将如此。如果你希望组织中的人们凭能力 (merit) 上升，希望影响力能够促进更好的决策制定 (decision-making)，制造更好的产品，拥有更好的公司，更快地发展等等，你就需要创造一个组织环境 (habitat)，让 Jeffrey 观察到的常态化的失能世界在你所处的组织环境中大部分不适用。所以，如果你的组织环境允许人们互相伤害，那么你的表现水平会远低于如果互相伤害是极其无效的情况。这取决于你作为领导者、管理者等。当然，技能就是技能，它是你将意图转化为成果的能力。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\n很高兴你谈到了组织环境 (habitat)，这正是我想说的。所以我们只剩两件事要讨论，组织环境和专注力，如何为专注力创造更多空间并提高专注力。你现在已经多次提到了这个组织环境的概念。我认为另一种思考方式是你们公司的文化。是这样吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:06):\n完全正确。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):\n好的，太棒了。那么，你有什么建议可以帮助人们创建一个有利于好事发生的组织环境 (habitat) 吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:15):\n我们从头开始说起。在科学认知与商业实践之间的差异中，我们来关注一个事实：大多数公司处理文化的方式都有着不稳定的记录 (shaky track record)。就像如果使命、愿景、价值观 (mission, vision, values) 是一架航空公司，你绝不会允许任何家庭乘坐那架飞机。它无法到达大多数预期的目的地。这是一个非常重要的起点，因为我们讨论这个问题时，我将要打破一个旧信条 (sacred cow)。我不想让任何人觉得我在刻意刁难或什么的。只是值得审视那些无效的东西，并思考是否有更好的方法。所以，如果我们看组织环境 (habitat) 和文化，它实际上是关于人们相信什么。是关于人们相信什么是可接受的、被允许的、富有成效的，而人们处理文化的最大缺陷，有趣的是，即使是 YC (Y Combinator) 也谈到这些使命、愿景、价值观、文化等，这些都晚点再来，让业务先发展起来。如果那是你要用的范式 (paradigm)，他们说得对，因为它反正也不会奏效。所以你不如晚点再做。\n\n(01:38:31):\n但如果你要用正确的方法去做，调查人类的信念，我们举例谈到启动效应 (priming)，文化就是整个企业在宏观层面的启动效应 (macro priming)，关乎你的核心信念体系 (central belief systems)，以及那些信念体系所形成的许可。如果你做得非常好，你就应该从一开始就做。我们应该以什么样的方式来运营这家公司，建设它，共同努力等等？从第一天起就做好这一点会非常有帮助。关于人们拥有的信念体系，有两种改变人们信念的方法。\n\n(01:39:10):\n使命、愿景、价值观，我们称之为表演式方法 (performative approach)。意思是，我将提出一些富有启发性的使命、价值观和愿景的表达，它会表现得足够好。就像如果我们在公园里街头卖艺 (busking in the park)，这将是一个足够酷的使命、愿景、价值观，人们会往我的吉他盒里扔些零钱，他们会接受它，聚集过来。我认为这完全是错误的方法，因为我们希望激励人们。我们希望在艺术上足够有才华来做到这一点。另一种方法是演绎的 (deductive)，逻辑演绎的 (logically deductive)，也就是说，从根本上讲，市场上应该有一个乐意我们公司存在的群体，他们为什么乐意我们存在？这正在将我们的使命转变为我们称之为你的角色，你在周围世界中扮演的角色。\n\n(01:40:08):\n谁乐意你存在？他们为什么乐意你存在？这是一个事实。这不是一个鼓舞人心的想法。这就像，好的，我们与一家公司合作，这家公司做基于人工智能的光学字符识别 (AI-based optical character recognition, OCR)、文档摄取 (document ingestion) 等。为什么世界乐意他们存在？嗯，因为我们能将 95% 的文档扫描成结构化数据 (structured data)，而这些数据通常需要人工传输。这非常有说服力。为什么世界乐意 Warby Parker 存在？因为以前你不得不在看起来傻气且便宜和看起来酷炫但昂贵之间做出选择，而现在你可以看起来酷炫且便宜。世界真的很高兴我们存在。\n\n(01:40:50):\n现在这是真的。我不需要你被启发去相信这是真的。现在我们其余的信念，我们将从这里推断 (deduce) 出来。所以我们只用逻辑来建立我们的文化，而不是灵感。所以我们接下来需要弄清楚的是，当我们在这个世界中扮演这个角色时，我们如何理解所创造的具体价值？我们为人们省钱，我们为人们省时间，我们开拓市场，我们帮助人们探索他们原本无法触及的可能性和潜力等等。\n\n(01:41:21):\n那么，Core 的作用是什么？人们很高兴我们存在，因为我们挖掘了他们以前无法触及的潜力。在团队层面，在公司层面，这可能意义重大。所以我们知道这一点，我们会说：“好的，天哪，这意味着很多。”现在我们有很多事情要做，那会产生什么价值呢？然后我可以说，一旦我们理解了价值的定义，它来自于我们的角色，现在我们就可以改变“完成”的定义。很多团队都谈论行动偏见 (bias to action)。仓鼠有行动偏见 (hamsters have bias to action)。它们从稻草堆里爬起来，尽其所能地转动轮子，却一无所获。但是，如果你理解你所扮演的角色——\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:42:01):\n但是，如果你理解你在世界中扮演的角色，并且你理解你所创造的价值，无论是时间节省、成本节省、上行空间 (upside) 还是你所做的任何事情，那么你就可以说：“我们应该有影响偏见 (bias to impact)，而不是行动偏见。我们不应该只是做事，我们应该产生价值创造 (value creation) 的结果。我们应该为人们节省时间。”现在，当你在一个产品团队中，看到这一点，并且你说：“嗯，Lenny，这是一个很酷的新想法，我们来做这个。”你现在就可以将其用作组织环境层面上的许可，就像：“哦，这如何为人们创造价值？这如何让人们更快，节省时间，更聪明，做他们原本做不到的事情？”然后你仍然可以使用相同的词汇 (vocabulary) 去向他们推销：“它如何让你更快，更聪明，更高效，节省成本。”\n\n(01:42:50):\n所以这就像真正的逻辑演绎 (logical deduction)。如果人们认为我们应该做一些不创造价值的事情，构建一个产品不创造价值。现在，我们不必再充满启发性，我们可以变得有逻辑。我们不构建不创造价值的东西，这不是优先级，除非我们能把它变成能创造价值的东西。所以你正在把文化变成高度可用 (highly usable) 的东西，从表演式文化 (performative culture) 转向逻辑演绎文化 (logical deductive culture)。我认为这对于大多数人来说是真正的关键，那就是说：“让我们了解世界为什么乐意我们存在。”这就是我们拥有团队的原因，这就是我们拥有客户的原因。那对我们在价值创造 (value creation) 方面执行时的标准意味着什么？甚至小到一封电子邮件。如果我发送一封蹩脚的邮件回复 (wonky email reply) 给某人的问题，而它没有为他们创造价值，那我还没有完成。我需要完成这项工作，直到它为他们创造价值。\n\n(01:43:43):\n质量标准内置于此 (Quality standards are baked into this)，这一点又是隐含的。如果 Warby Parker 给我寄来一个质量只有2分（满分10分）的东西，我会高兴他们存在吗？不会。所以我们不能制造只有2分的东西。每个人都有自己的信念。肯定有很多人在 Warby Parker 面试时会想，2分质量完全可以，只要发出去就行。不，我们需要对这种信念产生抗体 (antibody to that belief)。我们有决策智能 (decision-making intelligence)，每个人都认为我们应该快速行动，打破常规 (go fast, break stuff)，或者我们应该非常慢，把所有事情都做好，介于两者之间的任何位置。这是一个有趣的话题。最后，你有一个团队协作动态信念 (teaming dynamic belief)，它本质上是每个人对如何对待他人是可接受的信念。这会让另一个人处于什么样的状态？\n\n(01:44:35):\n很多人，特别是像我这种情商（low politeness）不高的人，会花数年时间认为：“我正在快速给出坦诚的反馈。这是高效的。”但你会想：“当人们需要六个月而不是六分钟来采纳你的反馈时，这怎么能算高效呢？因为他们就是不喜欢你，而且你这种亲和力（appeal）问题让你无法进入任何重要的场合。”实际上，你的效用（utility）——你的礼貌（politeness）是一种效用传递机制（utility transferred mechanism）——但我们不希望你在场。所以在这种情况下，你并不能带来商业价值（business benefit）。这就是起点。这就是“栖息地”（habitat，指组织或个人所处的环境和文化氛围）的零点，它告诫我们不要将栖息地建立在灵感（inspiration）的基础之上。这行不通。它当然可以成功，对吧？如果你做的事情极具启发性，你本人也极具启发性，那么你可能拥有实现这一目标的艺术能力。但即便如此，如果你通过逻辑推理（logical deduction）而不是灵感来做这件事，你的效果会更好。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):\n假设有人说：“好吧，我要改善我的栖息地，我要改善我的公司文化。或者我只是想开始建立一个良好的栖息地。”他们能做些什么呢？他们今天、本周能做些什么来开始这项工作？是不是坐下来思考我们提供什么价值？我们为何存在？你还有什么其他建议吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:45:54):\n大脑渴望得到“我为什么要做这件事？”这个问题的答案。我们不仅应该开始做一些事情，我还喜欢通过这样一种方式来加深人们对我们应该开始做的事情的承诺，那就是，我们应该开始做那些我们一直疏忽（negligent）去做的事情，对吗？不只是“哦，这会更好”，而是我们实际上由于在某些事情上的疏忽而导致了一些栖息地（habitat）问题。所以人们主要疏忽的一点是，没有向他们的团队回答“我为什么要这么做”这个问题。而说“你应该这么做，因为这是你的工作”，这本身就是一种疏忽（negligence），对吧？你并没有真正以任何有用的方式回答这个问题。因为我也可以用一种“安全”的方式来回答，就像我刚才说的“这是你的工作”那样。我暗示着会有后果。但我也可以说，因为如果你不这样做，就会发生这些具体的不好的事情。\n\n(01:46:52):\n你可以从奖励（reward）的角度给他们一个“为什么”，比如，“哦，如果你这样做，你就能得到这个，或者如果我们这样做，我们就能得到这个。”但你也可以给他们一个有目的性（purposeful）的“为什么”的答案，这并非一种疏忽（negligence），那就是说，因为我们的工作确实很重要。外面有人在等着我们发布（ship）这款产品来改善他们的状况，同时他们也希望我们能把事情做对。所以，通过这个视角，我们更倾向于关注其产生的影响（bias to impact）。我们确实需要发布（ship）这个产品。它必须实现，而且必须是对的，或者至少在它的第一个版本中足够正确。\n\n(01:47:28):\n所以，如果你曾经疏忽（negligent）过——我们大家有时都会，对吧？我不是想评判，而是想让你“信服”（convict），对吧？建立一些信念（conviction），建立一些承诺（commitment）。如果你一直疏忽（negligent），没有向所有与你合作的人解释我们为什么要这样做。这就是起点，确保每个人都知道“为什么”。而且这个“为什么”是团队共同的“为什么”。不仅仅是西蒙·斯涅克（Simon Sinek，一位知名的领导力专家，以“从为什么开始”的理念闻名）那种宏大的“为什么”？我指的是非常具体的“为什么”。对于我的团队来说，当我们制作培训材料时，我们就是通过这个视角来看待的：如果我们做对了，团队、公司、产品及其客户会发生什么变化。\n\n(01:48:12):\n这其中有一条贯穿始终的主线（through line），也解释了为什么我们不能那样做，或者为什么我们应该更加执着于质量，为什么我们作为一个团队应该更加相互依赖（interdependent），停止只按自己的想法行事。而是说：“嘿，Lenny，我正考虑这样做。在我开始之前，你有什么要补充的吗？”然后你可能会说：“哦，我觉得如果你那样做，会好10%。”然后我们的产品就提高了10%。所以，这就像回到了原点（square one），问问自己，我们的团队上次讨论我们为什么要这样做是什么时候？它产生了什么价值？谁受到我们决策的影响？如果有一段时间没讨论过了，那可不是好事。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:57):\n这可以理解成是你的使命（mission）吗？这是一个术语吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:49:02):\n是的，我认为这是使命（mission）的替代品，我尝试……我不想完全否定使命、愿景、价值观，因为我认为它们可以起作用。但我认为，如果人们能理解我们扮演的是一个“角色”（role），而不是在“完成一项使命”（fulfilling a mission），那么他们就更容易理解自己工作的重要性。而“角色”意味着义务（obligation）。使命中没有义务，除非你感受到的灵感（inspiration）非常强烈。这些差异很微妙，但在神经学（neurologically）上是不同的。如果我告诉你的大脑：“Lenny，有很多人指望着你把这件事做好。”你的大脑会激活一个叫做前脑岛皮层（anterior insular cortex，大脑中与情绪、意识和决策相关的区域）的区域，它会开始在你创造的解决方案背景下思考他人。\n\n(01:49:45):\n如果我以更笼统的方式说：“我们通过这个来改变人们的生活。”你的前额叶皮层（prefrontal cortex，大脑中负责高级认知功能，如规划、决策和社交行为的区域）仍然会激活来解决问题，但你的前脑岛皮层（anterior insular cortex）则不会，从而无法更深入地考虑受问题影响的人。所以，这就像是在增加大脑在解决问题时能调用的“工具箱”（toolkit）。如果你激活了更多大脑中好的区域，你就能得到更好的解决方案。因此，我倾向于这种观点。我个人认为：“你真的不需要使命宣言（mission statement）。你需要理解你扮演的角色，人们需要有一些反应，一些生理上的反应，比如‘我明白了，我的行动会影响到他人。’”如果他们没有这种反应，你肯定应该去找一个有这种反应的人。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:35):\n我想追溯最后一个话题——专注（focus）。你有一些非常棒的建议，可以帮助大家。这源于每个人都想更好地专注。每个人都希望他们的团队有更多时间专注。每个人都希望他们的工程师能更快地构建东西，他们的设计师能把事情做完。这一切都来自于真正擅长专注，并为你的团队创造专注的空间。对于那些想亲自学习如何更好地专注，并帮助他们的团队有更多时间专注、实质上完成工作的人，你有什么建议？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:51:10):\n我的意思是，这不正是问题所在吗？因为所有事情最终都归结于此，对吧？首先，让我们看看我们现有的神经科学（neuroscience）。那就是，对专注的研究要么是，要么与对“脑电波”（brain waves，大脑中神经元活动产生的电信号）的研究紧密相关。这正变得越来越流行。我们甚至在运动员身上也看到了这一点，比如职业高尔夫球手，他们会研究自己的脑电波是如何集中在高尔夫击球上的，以及应该让大脑进入哪种模式才能达到最高水平的高尔夫表现。同样适用于工作。有很多不同类型的脑电波频带（bands of brain waves）。它们中的大多数实际上发生在你睡觉的时候。所以你的快速眼动睡眠周期（REM cycles，睡眠阶段之一，大脑活跃，常伴有梦境）、深度睡眠周期、以及你打瞌睡时的周期，这些都是脑电波。你可以在做梦时感受到大脑关闭，感受到大脑开启。但当你醒着的时候，你的大脑实际上有三种主要模式。\n\n(01:52:03):\n从专业角度来说，比较专业的术语是 Alpha（阿尔法波）、Beta（贝塔波）和 Gamma（伽马波）。这些是不同的大脑活动范围，它们基本代表了你的大脑有多专注。所以 Alpha 简单来说就是白日梦（daydreaming）。你的大脑非常安静和空旷。一个简单的比喻是，如果你晚上在家，一切都很安静，你会听到白天听不到的声音，Alpha 状态下的大脑就是这样。你的大脑实际上在潜意识（subconsciously）中做了很多工作。但当你忙碌时，也就是 Beta 状态，你的大脑太嘈杂了，听不到房子里那些细微的吱呀声和爆裂声。但在 Alpha 状态下，你就能听到这些东西。\n\n(01:52:41):\n所以对大多数人来说，Alpha 状态最常见的场景是淋浴。这解开了一个谜团，比如为什么我在洗澡时总是有那么多想法？嗯，那是因为你的大脑处于 Alpha 状态。它听到了阁楼里那些细微的吱呀声和爆裂声（比喻那些突然冒出的想法），并把它们解开。它会说：“哦，那是个有趣的想法。”它凭空而来。它可以是开车、园艺、洗车、骑自行车，随便什么。只要认知负荷（cognitive load，指大脑处理信息时所需的精神努力）不是太大，你就可以做白日梦。我稍后会回到这一点，因为在栖息地（habitat）层面，对于某些专注水平来说，存在一个很大的“许可问题”（permission problem，指组织文化是否允许人们进入这些状态）。\n\n(01:53:14):\nBeta（贝塔波）是生产力模式（productivity mode）。如果你曾看到有人背后的墙上贴着海报写着“把事情搞定”（Get shit done），那基本上就是一张写着 Beta 的海报。我喜欢 Beta。处理邮件、开会、编写代码。也有一些 Gamma 模式（gamma code）的、更深层次思考的场景，比如你正在编写代码、进行演示、制作演示文稿。我们大部分的工作日都处于 Beta 状态，而且……我的意思是，我们有些人对 Beta 工作的需求是无限的。有源源不断的事情可以做、可以完成。\n\n(01:53:55):\nGamma（伽马波）是你的大脑高度专注的状态。所以如果你正在学习一些非常复杂的东西，比如你在大学里学习热力学（thermodynamics，物理学的一个分支，研究热、功、温度和能量之间的关系）之类的，你就会觉得，“哇，这不容易。”你必须真正推动你的大脑去理解这些概念，融会贯通（connect the dots），甚至记住某些东西，那就是 Gamma 状态。我们在工作中也会有时感受到这一点，比如这里有一个复杂的问题，我们可以在 Beta 模式下通过“打补丁”（slapping duct tape on it，比喻用权宜之计解决问题）来处理它，或者我们可以在 Gamma 模式下通过逆向工程（reverse engineering，指对产品、系统或软件进行解构，以了解其工作原理）和深入研究来处理它。这就是我们开始将我们之前谈到的“专注”和“逆向工程”联系起来的地方。在 Beta 模式下，你无意学习任何新东西来完成工作，无意更深入地思考来完成工作，也无意重新审视你头脑中现有的流程、结构或框架来完成工作，你只是利用这些东西来完成工作。\n\n(01:54:52):\nGamma 状态是我们会说：“我通常会这样做。我明白为什么那不是正确的方法。我需要创造一些新的东西。我需要打破我现有的框架，立即建立一个全新的框架来做某事。”所以我们通常在工作中花太多时间在 Beta 状态，这既是一种判断（judgment call），因为我当然对 Beta 有自己的看法。我称之为“尽责性危机”（conscientiousness crisis，指过度依赖尽责工作模式，而忽视创新和适应变化的危机）。尽责性（conscientiousness，大五人格特质之一，表现为勤奋、有条理、有责任感）追求 Beta 模式，而开放性（openness，大五人格特质之一，表现为好奇心、创造性和对新体验的接受度）则追求 Gamma 模式。我正在尝试将这些点联系起来。这并不是说尽责性（conscientiousness）本质上是一种危机，但当你遇到那些没有进行任何创新、没有重新思考市场、对周围环境变化麻木不仁、对自己员工问题也麻木不仁的团队时，它们仍然像一辆火车头一样，不管周围发生什么都持续前进。正是那种埋头苦干（heads-down，指专注于手头工作，不关心外部环境）的尽责性（conscientious）Beta 模式，让人觉得“现在不是时候，让我们保持专注，保持专注”，等等。\n\n(01:55:53):\n所以我们不想摆脱 Beta 模式，我们有很多工作要做。但让我们提出一个经验法则（rule of thumb）供人们探索，因为它对每个团队和每个公司都是主观的。但作为一条经验法则，如果你一年中有25%的时间花在 Gamma 和 Alpha 状态，你可能会比那些一年中花在深度思考和白日梦（daydreaming）模式的时间少于25%的团队好得多。所以我想回顾的是，我们如何才能富有成效地（productively）做白日梦呢？嗯，这听起来很荒谬（preposterous）。而这正是你可以在脑海中建立的……如果人们想看的话，我确实有另一份 PDF 文档。\n\n(01:56:32):\n但你可以在脑海中构建一个3x3的网格，其中列是我们的安全系统 (safety system)、奖励 (reward) 和目的系统 (purpose system)。行是阿尔法 (alpha)、贝塔 (beta) 和伽马 (gamma)，我们基本上有九个大脑可以激活的通道列表，以生成不同类型的思维。而大多数公司、大多数团队，其所有的编程都主要来自贝塔安全 (safety beta) 和贝塔奖励 (reward beta)。我怎样才能忙碌起来以获得奖励、投资回报率 (ROI)、客户、交易等等？甚至是升职，更以自我为中心的奖励？以及贝塔安全 (beta safety)，那将是：我怎样才能忙碌起来？形象管理 (optics)，管理我的声誉，避免风险，诸如此类？\n\n(01:57:19):\n这场危机基本上是意识到，在九个可用盒子中的这两个上面花费太多时间，可能根本无法产生接近理想的结果。如果我们能通过回答大脑对“为什么”的渴望，转向有目的的 (purposeful) 一列，给出一个解释，这不是关于你，也不是关于我们，而是关于其他人指望着我们把事情做好，这对你来说重要吗？因为对大多数人来说，他们会说：“是的，这真的很酷。我可以在其他人的生活和我的世界之外发生的真实事情上产生影响吗？”所以，这激活了，现在突然我们可以说，好的，让我们看看顶部那一行的阿尔法 (alpha)。\n\n(01:58:06):\n阿尔法安全 (Alpha safety) 是当你洗澡时，你所有的焦虑、担忧等等突然从你思想的阁楼 (attic of your mind) 中冒出来。阿尔法奖励 (alpha reward) 中会发生什么？那是当你获得如何达成交易、如何赢得某些东西的突破时。这是白日梦 (daydreaming)，但你的大脑被设定为以某种方式做白日梦，无论是关于焦虑还是愤怒，或者是否与你关心的奖励有关。如果是目的，这就是从愿景角度、可能性产品角度来看，如果你的大脑被设定为有目的的 (purposeful)，然后你做白日梦，各种疯狂酷炫的想法就会涌入你的脑海。\n\n(01:58:44):\n你可以在一天中这样做。有些公司比其他公司更容易做到。但如果你能离开你的办公桌，去公园什么的坐个10分钟、20分钟，让你的大脑平静下来，听着，你的大脑中可能会发生一些很酷的事情。我不能保证，但你必须亲自尝试才能发现它对你来说是如何运作的。然后伽马 (gamma) 也一样，当你听到诸如“我们这辈子都不能谈论这个了”之类的短语时，那是伽马预防团队 (gamma prevention team) 踹开门 (kicking the door down) 说：“我们来这里是要让你们回到贝塔 (beta) 状态。大家，把手背到身后，”就是这样一种情况。\n\n(01:59:22):\n这就是环境 (habitat) 和专注 (focus) 有些重要的原因，因为你永远不会从贝塔思维 (beta mind) 中获得伽马 (gamma) 想法。你永远不会从贝塔思维 (beta mind) 中获得阿尔法 (alpha) 想法。所以，如果你的业务需要一些突破性、白日梦式、有趣的想法来创造邻近业务 (adjacencies) 以开发新产品、寻找新市场、更好地履行你在当前市场中的角色，那么团队必须被允许进入那种智力专注状态 (intellectual focused state)，否则你就是在关闭那个通道。你正在将它从通过你特定订阅可用的程序中移除。\n\n(02:00:04):\n伽马 (gamma) 也是如此。环境 (habitat) 基本上需要确立伽马 (gamma) 是许多工作的可行通道 (viable channel)，并且允许进入。你当然可以做得过头。这就是为什么我说25%，你不需要把一半的时间、四分之三的时间都花在伽马 (gamma) 上。如果你在一个下午花三四个小时处于那种深度专注状态 (deep-focused state)，你能有多聪明简直令人震惊 (It bonkers how smart you can be)，你只会做一些你以前从未做过的事情。如果你能让团队进行伽马集中 (gamma-focused) 的场外活动 (off-sites)，每个人都散开，独自一人，做那些伽马和阿尔法集中 (alpha-focused) 的、有成效的事情，然后你带回想法。你将简单地产生你 otherwise 无法产生的思维和结果。也许10%对你来说是合适的。也许30%对你来说是合适的，这取决于你的市场和客户群有多么动态 (dynamic)。但这只是一个挑战你自己的问题。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:00:58):\n这些东西太引人入胜了 (fascinating)，我真希望我们能再花一个小时深入探讨 (dig deep into this)。因为它感觉仅仅这一点就将真正改变公司 (transform the way companies operate) 的运作方式。所以让我们尝试给人们一些战术性的 (tactical) 事情，他们可以做这些事情来为阿尔法波 (alpha waves) 和伽马波 (gamma waves) 创造更多空间。你的建议本质上是，如果可能的话，你四分之一的时间应该花在阿尔法 (alpha) 和伽马 (gamma) 时间上。对吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:01:22):\n是的，坦率地说，我觉得这可能有点过剩 (overabundance)。但如果你从季度的视角 (lens of a quarter) 来考虑，如果你要遵循一系列节奏 (cadences)，这可能就是战术性建议 (tactical advice)。就像是，审视你的节奏 (cadences)，然后说，在季度层面，这对大多数人来说可能是审视他们的日历的正确详细程度 (level of fidelity)，即我们应该做哪些大事 (what big stuff should we be doing)？因为六个月通常太长，做不成什么大事。世界上发生了太多事情。一年肯定太长，不能等到一个节奏 (cadence) 启动 (kick in)。所以季度节奏 (quarterly) 真的很好。而且好的是，当我们在这个季度节奏上集中我们的伽马 (gamma) 时间时，我们可以处理很多被称为日程入侵者 (calendar invaders) 的事情，这些是凭空出现的随机对话。我们可以说：“嗯，我们正准备两周后举行本季度的场外活动 (offsite)。这个想法能等到那时再处理吗 (Can this idea wait until then to be processed)？”\n\n(02:02:16):\n所以你会有这种很好的小黑洞效应 (black hole effect)，很多干扰都有了一个新家，因为你实际上已经说了：“我们要明确地做事 (distinctly do stuff)。”你对很多干扰都说：“是的，但不是现在。” 但我认为这是理想的节奏 (cadence)。对于一些团队来说，这可能需要半天或一整天。你会根据自己的业务来确定。但每个季度需要多少时间才能打破贝塔 (beta) 状态，进入深度思考分析模式 (deep thinking analysis mode)？我们的运营有多健康 (healthy is our operation)？我们有多聪明？我们是否在交付价值 (delivering value)？需要从市场经验、客户经验、团队经验中重新评估什么？让我们看看业务的这些不同视角，并做出一些优先决策 (prioritized decisions)，关于我们这个季度将为这些领域做出具体的改进 (specific improvements)。\n\n(02:03:10):\n然后即使每周一次，如果你可以的话，也许只需半天，或者少于半天，几个小时，每周一次进入伽马 (gamma) 状态。你会从那里慢慢摸索出来。但25%的经验法则 (rule of thumb) 之所以存在，是因为25%有点像风险点 (risk point)。因为大多数人会说：“我们甚至没有花5%。”或者完美主义团队 (perfectionist team) 可能会说：“我们有50%。”所以，如果你远离那个经验法则 (rule of thumb)，那是一个很好的指标，表明是时候进行自我审查 (audit yourself) 了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:03:42):\n当你听到“深度工作 (deep work)”这个词时，它通常指的是伽马时间 (gamma time) 吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:03:47):\n是的，人们可以用几种方式来使用这个词。我认为很多人称深度工作为“不要打扰我的贝塔 (don't bother me beta)”，这可能是一种。其他团队可能称伽马为深度工作 (deep work)，但这可能更恰当。我认为，“不要打扰我的贝塔 (don't bother me beta)”对于一些团队来说，他们需要被告知：“不，不，利用这段时间不仅是为了不被打扰，而且是为了以不同的方式思考问题。思考架构是否正确 (architecture even right)？我们思考问题的方式是否正确？”而不仅仅是完成很多事情 (get a lot of stuff done)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:04:18):\n是的。所以不仅仅是坐在收件箱里写文档，而是真正尝试思考更大的问题 (bigger problems)，那些挑战你大脑的问题，而不仅仅是像“我只是高效地完成事情 (productive getting stuff done)，完成事情”这样。太棒了。对我来说非常有效的一件事，类似于你刚才推荐的，就是我每周有两段独立的时间 (two blocks of time)，每次两三个小时，就是“不要打扰我，深度工作时间 (deep work time)”。所以我记得是周三上午和周五上午，各两三个小时。实际上在日历上，如果你在这段时间安排了什么，我就会揍你一顿 (slap you)。这非常有效，没有人抱怨。\n\n(02:04:54):\n我们谈了很多。我们谈到的这些：我刚才一直在做笔记，你分享的所有建议，如何帮助人们更好地开会 (run better meetings)，如何更好地为团队、公司和产品制定愿景 (developing vision)，如何成为更好的影响者 (better influencer)。如何建立更好的关系 (build better relationships)，如何为你的公司创造更好的文化 (create a better culture)，如何创造更多专注和更高效的专注 (more productive focus)。这很多。我为我们的对话感到非常自豪。在我们进入一个非常短暂的闪电回合 (lightning round) 之前，因为我们已经聊了很久了，我想简短一点。\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:22):\n当然。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:05:22):\n你还有什么想分享的，想留给听众的，你认为可能有所帮助的，在我们结束之前——\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:28):\n不，我认为我们不需要……我的意思是，当然还有很多我们可以谈论的，但我想我们不想让任何人头脑崩溃 (melt any minds)。所以我们希望人们离开时会想：“我能做到那个，我能做到那个，我能做到那个。”所以一定要选择两三个胜利点 (wins)。我称它们为“煮几锅海水 (pots of ocean to boil)”，而不是“煮沸整个海洋 (oceans to boil)”。所以先煮几锅海水，务必专注于此。而且，如果这是你的问题领域，一定要把其中一锅定为你所拥有的经验 (experience you are)。我的意思是，这是所有一切的核心。一旦你煮沸了那一锅海水，整个系统中其他的一切都会运作得更好，然后事情就会变得更容易。\n\n(02:06:05):\n然后我想我最后要补充的唯一一点是，想想我们今天谈到的一切。用“抬高地板和抬高天花板 (floor risers and ceiling risers)”来形容可能会有帮助。因为你的公司有一个绩效视野 (horizon of performance) 要进入，那个范围有一个下限和一个上限。所以当你更好地开会时，你不仅在提高……你正在抬高地板 (raising the floor)，以消除糟糕的会议和浪费，你可能会节省大量时间 (saving a ton of time) 或将无用的时间转化为有用的时间，但你也可能在抬高天花板 (raising the ceiling)。\n\n(02:06:35):\n我希望你对自己和你的团队非常具体地说明，你追逐的是什么结果 (which outcome are you chasing)？是两者兼有？还是其中之一？然后说，我们实际上是在努力抬高地板 (raise the floor)，以便我们的绩效永远不会低于某个范围。结果是我们变得更快、更聪明 (faster, smarter)，错误更少 (fewer mistakes)。或者我们实际上是在努力解除我们目前正在应对的天花板 (uncap a ceiling)，尤其是在战略和愿景 (strategy and vision) 等方面？如果我们觉得那些对话总是以难以置信的争论 (inconceivable arguments) 告终，那么我们的业务绩效就有一个天花板 (ceiling on our business's performance)。因此，我们能否抬高那个天花板 (raise that ceiling)，为业务探索一个更高的绩效视野 (explore a higher horizon of performance)？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:12):\n太棒了 (Amazing)。埃文，说到这里，我们已经进入了我们非常激动人心且非常快的闪电回合 (lightning round)。你准备好了吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:18):\n是的，来吧 (Let's do it)。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:20):\n好的，那么我们先从你推荐给别人最多的两三本书开始吧？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:26):\n那么，最明显的第一个是《Never Split the Difference》（绝不妥协）。我向宇宙中的每个人推荐这本书。我认为如果你还没读过这本书，你就不应该拿到驾照。对于不知道的人来说，它是由克里斯·沃斯（Chris Voss）写的，他曾是联邦调查局（FBI，Federal Bureau of Investigation）的人质谈判专家。它探讨了如何与人谈判，不仅仅是人质，还有你的同事、父母、妻子，就像所有人一样。里面有一些非常令人惊讶且出乎意料的技巧，不是试图让人同意你，而是让他们更经常地说“不”。不要说：“嘿，莱尼，你愿意做这个吗？”而是说：“嘿，莱尼，你反对做这个吗？”这只是一种逆转。而“我给你一个退路”，是他解释这种方式的方法。还有很多其他的技巧，但团队中掌握这些技巧越多越好。团队的表现也会越好。这是不言而喻的（no-brainer）。\n\n(02:08:16):\n我要说的第二个，既然我们今天多少谈到了一点关于“habitat”（环境，栖息地）这个话题。如果你喜欢读那种有点像“root canals”（根管治疗）的书，但读了之后你会变得更好，那么有一本书叫做《Never...》不，不是《Never Split the Difference》，是《The Person and the Situation》（人与情境）。它是由一些研究人员，一些心理学研究人员写的。它探讨的是个性如何影响你的行为，以及你所处的情境，或者像我们谈到的，你所处的“habitat”（环境，栖息地）如何影响你的行为之间的区别。如果你还没有确信这些因素中的任何一个都很重要，比如，“哦，不重要。无论环境如何，我都会做我该做的，或者无论我是谁，我都会做我该做的”，那本书将彻底颠覆你现有的“mental model”（心智模型）。了解情境如何影响一个人，以及个性如何影响一个人的“mechanics”（机制），是非常有价值的知识。\n\n(02:09:12):\n然后我想最后一个，也许我们可以把它看作是“choose your own adventure”（选择你自己的冒险）中的一个岔路口。如果你是这方面的真正“student of the game”（行家），并且想在这方面进行“10,000 leagues under the sea”（深入探索），有一套书叫做《Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience》（剑桥神经科学基础）。你可以在亚马逊（Amazon）上找到它。很多书你可以在你的Kindle（电子阅读器）上以比图书馆装饰版便宜得多的价格买到，但那真是“bonkers”（疯狂的，棒极了的）。它谈论了你的大脑如何应用于智力、情感和人际关系。这是令人难以置信的知识。如果你更想将其保留在你所体验和能看到的世界部分，而不是大脑。泰勒（Thaler）写了一本书叫做《Misbehaving》（“不当行为”或“错误行为”）。这有点像关于“behavioral economics”（行为经济学）的主要书籍。\n\n(02:09:58):\n再多说一句，我们在公司里花了很多时间讨论人们应该如何行事，而不是人们实际如何行事。而“behavioral economics”（行为经济学）本质上是经济学的一个版本，它关注人们实际如何行事，而不是人们应该如何行事。所以我认为这是一个很棒的研究领域。然后，罗伯特·格林（Robert Greene）的整个书库都非常有价值，特别是《Human Nature》（人性），如果你对那个感兴趣的话。他是一位有点阴暗的作家，肯定对人性毫不留情（doesn't pull punches）。所以这些都是值得探索的好书。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:10:28):\n你最近有没有发现什么你非常喜欢的产品？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:10:31):\n我更多地关注产品的品类级别。我真的很喜欢那些拥有出色“ergonomics”（人体工程学）的产品。很多人低估了使用产品时的感受的价值。东西是否在正确的时间放在正确的位置？我刚开办了一个时事通讯（newsletter），它有点像，我们如何将我们所做的一切分解成“bite-sized pieces”（小块内容），让那些对这些东西非常感兴趣的人每周都能获得一些东西？它让我接触到了Beehiiv，这是一个设计非常好的“newsletter platform”（时事通讯平台），“ergonomics”（人体工程学）做得很好。我从没觉得有什么难找的东西。我可以让事情按我想要的方式运作。\n\n(02:11:07):\n所以，我只是喜欢那个例子。我甚至记得以前我痴迷于寻找完美的旅行背包，然后你发现有些品牌，在你过安检时，你甚至不知道，但有一个口袋正好设计在你希望放手机的地方。你就会想，“那太棒了。我喜欢这个团队把这个口袋设计得恰到好处。”所以我的重点真的是产品中的“ergonomics”（人体工程学）。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:11:32):\n最后一个问题。我看到你发推特说人们都说你长得像杰迪·万斯（JD Vance），这太搞笑了。你认为这将是一个“net benefit”（净收益）还是一个“net hurdle”（净障碍）？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:11:42):\n这对万圣节（Halloween）来说将是一个巨大的好处，因为我万圣节要扮演什么角色已经完全清楚了。是的，我的意思是，我想我得看看街上的人……幸运的是我住在帕克城（Park City），所以我不会在街上遇到很多想对别人大喊大叫的人。但如果我住在芝加哥（Chicago）那样的地方，我毫不怀疑会有人过来朝我扔东西。但是，是的，到目前为止，我对这个话题持中立态度，除了万圣节的额外好处。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:12:09):\n拭目以待。我们会看看你的生活如何改变。埃文（Evan），这真是太棒了。这次对话内容非常丰富。就像我说的，我们几乎涵盖了人们作为“product manager”（产品经理）想要提升的所有方面，你可以这么说。最后两个问题。人们在哪里可以找到你做的事情，以便更深入地挖掘，学习更多，更深入地向你学习？第二，听众如何能帮到你？\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:12:31):\n是的，我的意思是，他们当然可以在我们的网站“core-sciences.com”上找到我们做的很多事情。在那里找到你提到的那个“profile”（个人档案或测试）的链接，这会非常有趣且富有洞察力。那个“newsletter”（时事通讯），我们做的所有东西，你都可以在那里找到。然后当然还有推特（Twitter）。我的意思是，我一直对那些只在推特（Twitter）上发帖而不互动的人感到很不爽。我恰恰相反。我真的很喜欢人们的问题和“pushback”（反驳，反馈）。就在昨天，我可能花的时间比我按照“portfolio management”（投资组合管理）的时间分配方法应该花的时间要长得多，只是在一个帖子里和一位非常有趣的女士讨论了一个争论，关于人们根据自己的信念做事情的可能性，这真是……\n\n(02:13:28):\n然后我们有一些旁观者看着整个事情发生，之后我跟一个好朋友罗德（Rod）开会，我们谈论了这一切进展如何。所以我喜欢和人们交流，回答问题，我确信人们会有很多问题想深入探讨。所以我肯定在推特（Twitter）上。然后是你们如何能帮助我。我的意思是，对我来说幸运的是，我从事的是帮助别人的行业，无论是个人、团队还是公司。所以对我来说最有帮助的事情就是你帮助你自己。所以如果你觉得我们的内容有价值，如果你想拥有出色的经理，或者对这种基于科学、更有效率的方法感兴趣，那么就联系我们。我们不咬人（比喻我们很好相处）。我们很好合作。并且很高兴能就你的团队需求进行对话。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:08):\n埃文（Evan），非常感谢你来到这里。\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:14:10):\n谢谢你邀请我。这真的很棒。是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:12):\n我也一样。大家再见。非常感谢大家的收听。如果你觉得这有价值，你可以在苹果播客（Apple
