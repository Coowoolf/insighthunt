If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, you get dramatically better answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):\nI know you have a bunch of awesome advice on becoming more influential.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:16):\nIt's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game. The starting point is to choose your character. Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy, your personality kind of has a natural fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\nHow do we create better relationships within our teams?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:33):\nIt's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience? If the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet. You got to fix that first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nI'm really excited for this episode. I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:00:52):\nThen here's the surprise ending.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nToday, my guest is Evan LaPointe. Evan is the founder of CORE Sciences, which teaches companies and individuals how our brains actually work, and through that lens, how to more effectively work with other people on teams, how to build better products, how to grow your business, and how to make smarter and faster decisions. Evan is a four-time founder, including founding a company called Satellite, which is the fourth largest analytics product on the internet today, which was acquired by Adobe where he later ran product strategy and innovation for Adobe's digital business.\n\n(00:01:31):\nIn our conversation, Evan shares a simple way to understand how our brains work, and through that framework, how we can get better at vision work, influence, running meetings, having more focus and building better and more productive relationships with our colleagues. This conversation is a beautiful mix of science, theory, and also, a ton of very actionable and concrete things you can do to be more effective in your work.

With that, I bring you Evan LaPointe. Evan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:16):\nThanks very much for having me. I'm excited to share some stuff with people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:19):\nI am really excited for this episode because one, I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast. Two, I think it's going to really stretch our brains as we learn about how the brain works. Three, I think it's really going to make an impact on how people work and how they relate to other people and work with other people. I thought it'd be great to start by laying a little bit of foundation for people to get a sense of just what they need to understand about how the brain works before we get into how we can actually apply some of the stuff. Could you just share some of the stuff that is really important for us to know about how the brain works?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:02:53):\nThe brain is like a big galaxy. There's a National Geographic quote that we throw up in all of our programs that when we train teams, for example, that says the brain is more complex than any known structure in the universe. It's easy to read a sentence like that and just run straight away from the problem. I think that's important for people to not run away from this problem but more run toward it. It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember. The three or four main systems to stack on top of each other like layers, start with the fact that the brain has systems. I think of it like the brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it, and your brain has a science department responsible for open-minded experimentation.\n\n(00:03:39):\nIt has an art department in it responsible for creative boundless thinking. It has a history department designed for looking stuff up that you already know. If you think about sending your thoughts to the right department on the campus or just different departments, you're going to get super different responses back from your brain. Where we're stuck largely is most people rely on their history department way too much. That's because the brain is actually built to conserve energy, and that's the lowest energy form of generating an answer to a question that the brain can pull off. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, the humanities department of your compassion, et cetera, you get totally different answers. Certainly, if you ever build products as a company or offer services, those departments are going to give you dramatically better answers than the reference material just in your history department.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow.

That's E-X-P-L-O, dot, C-O, slash, Lenny.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:06:34):\nThat's the first thing is that the brain has these departments and systems in it and it also has pathways. The pathways thing is really important to understand because there's a likelihood that thought will go down certain pathways in each of our brains. Some of that has to do with personality, which predisposes us to have a higher-anxiety or a lower-anxiety response or a higher-creativity or lower-creativity response. You can also be more intentional with these pathways, and that's a big component of self-awareness is to know what are my preferences and then am I actually letting those preferences take over in the situation or might be more intentional steering down the pathways to activate these best regions and systems of the brain. The simplest way to keep track of the systems is there's three, there's three really big ones.\n\n(00:07:25):\nThere probably are more than three that you can learn about, but the ones we want to have everybody learn about are your safety system, your reward system, and your purpose system. Out of those three, two of them sound really real and one of them sounds like fantasy, to most people. The safety system is pretty obvious to most people. When we're scared, afraid, uncertain, we have doubt, we're resentful, angry, apathetic, etc. This system of our brain is trying to restore our standing in the universe, like I need to get out of this stress, out of this danger, out of this anger, etc. you have an objective that, that part of your brain, that system sets, and you go chase that objective, like I want to get safe. If you're in a meeting, a practical everyday situation, and you're exposed to a statement that makes you feel unsafe, your objective now actually isn't to contribute to the meeting productively anymore.\n\n(00:08:19):\nYour brain's objective is to get back to safety. The same thing of rewards that if somebody says you'll get something, if you do this, which is the opposite of safety, that if you don't do this, something bad will happen, then yeah, your brain gets into this pursuit, desire state, which seems great and can be great in a lot of cases, but also, can be pretty narrow. When you hear people say, \"That's not my job.\" That's actually the reward system speaking, saying, \"I get rewarded for the things in this list and this thing that you're talking about is not on my reward list and I therefore am not interested in it.\" I have an easier time pushing away from it because the reward system of the brain is more transactional in a conceptual way. Then you get to this vague and ridiculous sounding purpose system.\n\n(00:09:08):\nUntil you realize what purpose is, and we've all felt it, if you understand the impact of the thing that you're doing and you understand and care about the people that are impacted by your actions, those are the conditions for purpose, and that can be really big. Like curing cancer, I understand the impact on the people, that's huge. It can also be like I'm writing an email, I understand the impact of this email and the people affected by it. You can feel purpose at this tiny little grain of sand level of your life, not just at the whole beach and shoreline level, and we teach people that, that's super important. That's the foundational layer. Then on top of that, there are a few layers that have to do with your focus because the brain can dramatically shift focus from open mindedness to deep, deep focus.\n\n(00:09:55):\nThen there's the final layer of ability, which is less science- y, less neuroscience, and more just practical that your ability is regulated by how much reality you know, like do you have the context for the decision or you just know you're supposed to make the decision? People with context have higher ability than people without. The same thing with imagination and logic that if you push those boundaries in your mind further, your ability increases almost disproportionately to how much you've pushed, so these layers just stack on. I think it's approachable, it's simple. It's like, we can all understand, is my safety reward or purpose system active right now? What is my level of focus? What level of connection with reality, reason and imagination do I have right now? Then there's your output as a human or as a team, and all these things are like levers we can pull, which is super fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\nAmazing. Just to summarize here, so we have these three systems, safety, reward, purpose, then our level of focus, and then there's the ability, are we able to actually do the job? Those are the puzzle pieces.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:11:02):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:03):\nWhere I want to take this is when we work with other people, working with other people is very hard, and some of the struggles people have at work in building product, in running a company and building teams, hiring, all these things, is they often get really frustrated by the way other people operate. Some people want to just start building a thing, some people want to really think about it. Some people are very customer qualitative, anecdote focused, some people are very metrics focused. Some people are very collaborative, want to work in groups, some people are very, I want to work alone. Just first of all, we just talked about here's how the brain works and then there's this idea of people work very differently. Can you just talk a bit about just this idea of why people behave so differently in an effort to help us learn to work better with people that are just like, \"Oh, that's so strange. This person wants to just their billing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:12:02):\nMaybe one of the worst pieces of propaganda that people walk around with in their minds is the phrase we're more similar than we are different. My theory on why we walk around with that phrase or why we're told that phrase, if we zoom in on the situations where we hear that is that we have this theory, it's easier to get along with people that are like us. If we fantasize that this person is like me, then I might get along with them better. When in fact, we should probably be building the muscle that we have the capacity to get along with people that are extremely different than we are. That fourth piece that we talk about in our coursework when we train managers, for example, is personality. We talk about your brain systems, your brain focus, your brain's ability, which sort of paints the picture that humans might be similar to each other and we can activate these things kind of unilaterally.\n\n(00:12:54):\nThen we have to drop this bomb at the end, which is, and here's why that doesn't work consistently across different types of people. I know you took our profile, our big five-based profile, and that's just one tool out of many that can help a person understand where on these various spectrum of personality traits and motivations they sit. We often use the metaphor in our training of culinary school that we're more culinary school for human performance instead of cooking class. That helps people conceptualize that I'm used to going to cooking classes in my training, here's how to do a one-on-one, here's how to offer feedback, here's a framework for generating product ideas through to prioritization and backlog. We're like, \"Well, what's going on beneath the surface? What are the underlying principles and forces at work that all the stuff that comes to life on the surface really originates from?\"\n\n(00:13:50):\nIn this culinary school metaphor, one of the things that's really important for a chef is to actually understand what are my preferences? What do I like to eat? Because if I don't know what I like, then I assume everybody else likes what I like, then I'm not going to be a very dynamic chef. I'm going to be like, \"Everybody likes lots of salt and acidity in their dishes.\" Then you're going to go to Germany and open a restaurant and be like, \"That is absolutely not what we're looking for in this cuisine.\" Self-awareness is a really important step, not just of culinary school, but for everybody. You sit somewhere on a spectrum, your brain has these pathways and these traffic cops directing traffic in your mind. You have to start with square one with yourself and understand, am I prone to try to say things politely, and so that they're received well? Or am I prone to be super blunt and direct and maybe even mean and harsh? Am I prone to sit back in conversations and let things happen, or am I prone to take over?\n\n(00:14:48):\nAm I prone to go to intellectual abstract thinking and try to deconstruct ideas or am I prone to stay very pragmatic? If you don't know who you are and you think that the universe resembles you, then you're going to get super lost in that broader spectrum. I think the big five, I mean there's a bunch of models. You have Myers-Briggs, disk, etc. They're just all imperfect ways of measuring personality, but also, useful despite the fact that they're imperfect and especially useful if you take a growth mentality instead of a justification mentality to reading them. If you say, \"okay, I'm low in politeness, I'm super direct.\" Your justification mentality of that would be like, \"Yeah, damn right. I'm awesome that everybody knows what I really mean and how I really feel.' Versus the growth thing, which is like, well, maybe there are situations where I can try a little harder than 0% to phrase things in a way that if we work backwards from the outcome, we want to choose our actions right now, would these actions so direct actually increase or reduce the probability of that outcome?\n\n(00:15:54):\nThat's when we become more dynamic chefs, more dynamic people. Personality is a broad spectrum and self-awareness is the starting point for the whole thing. The big five model gives you a really good list of attributes to scan yourself through, and then you should be making a game plan for how to do that. Then you can turn your attention to the network of humans you're a part of and say, \"Okay, well in what ways, because I'm me, am I so different than these other minds?\" How can we create a mesh mentality where thought shifts among the group to fit most naturally? In product work, especially, whether you're a founder, entrepreneur, thinking about product at that level and your team at that level, or you're in the thick of product work pushing your mind and other people's minds to get this right, then you're going to benefit a lot from understanding these traits and these differences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\nI think the big unlock here for a lot of people is that the reason you are struggling, getting something done, working with someone, being successful at your company, with your manager, with a partner in your team, is they have a very different way of their brain operating, and so they think in a very different way, they react in different ways. You may think the entire world thinks the way you do, but they don't, and these tests help you see that. To make this super concrete for people, are there a couple of examples or wins you often find that you can share of just ways to use this to become better in your job, say this week? Whether with meetings or convincing someone of something, anything along these lines?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:17:28):\nI think one more layer would be helpful to this, especially if you're a leader or a manager, which is the business world isn't just hand-to-hand combat between a bunch of individuals on the blank matrix loading screen. You're actually in a habitat as a company and your team is like a habitat. I think of companies and teams, almost like little terrariums that we're inside of, and is this terrarium set up with sand and a heat lamp and we're a bunch of frogs, like we're going to turn into frog bacon, simply because we're in this habitat? A lot of it is you want to actually create a habitat or an environment that's predisposed to high-functioning thinking and high-functioning interaction between people.\n\n(00:18:15):\nBecause if the habitat is working against all of you to begin with, then all the hand-to-hand combat that's going to show up is actually largely a function of you just being in this heat lamp, dry, devoid of life, devoid of productive ways to grapple. That's where a lot of teams and companies sit today, especially more established teams. They've either lost their way in the habitat and haven't really set the scene for good, kind of thinking and interaction, or they just never had that to begin with. Some of this stuff, like when you've talked to a couple of other people in the past, your conversation, the Canva conversation, the Figma conversation both come to mind as like it is super obvious the energy that has gone into the habitat to predispose people to high function.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):\nYou're referring to in my interviews with the folks from Figma and Canva.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:13):\nExactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\nI see. Oh, say more about that mean.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:17):\nYou think about the, even in the Canva context of coaches instead of managers. I love this, let me back up for just a second. There's a great quote, I think Dan Pink has summarized the problem better than anybody when he said, \"There's a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.\" In that gap, it says, \"Well, what is it that business is doing that science knows better?\" You can almost look at this as an equation of science knows minus what your business does equals dysfunction. That is a pretty crystal-clear thing. If you take this managers versus coaches, they're taking intuitively, I think. I don't know if they're neuroscientists, but intuitively, I think a lot of great founders understand humans don't work a certain way, and this whole paradigm of managers seems to be failing a lot. This whole paradigm, like mantra, fail faster. Seems to be failing a lot, and mission statements seem to fail a lot.\n\n(00:20:22):\nYou look at this, science knows business does as a lens to examine yourself through and stuff that fails very often is worth a look. When you look at, okay, do we really want managers, because that seems to fail a lot? Or is there a paradigm that works better for human beings that activates more human potential and hit the nail on the head? If you do the math of Canva, what science knows versus what Canva does, whether they know they're doing it scientifically right or not, the math equals zero. There's no difference between what science knows and what business does in that case. Also, the Figma conversation, I loved the phrase from that conversation, imagination is a hypothesis generation engine, I think is what the word was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\nOh, the Dylan. Yeah, the chat with Dylan.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:21:14):\nI loved that idea. Because when we talk about imagination as a part of ability, we talk about imagination's capacity to generate alternatives for you, that's its purpose. It's not just to doodle in the margins in the middle of boring meetings. That's part of it, it's a side benefit. When you look at imagination's purpose, if you have a great imagination, you always have a lot of choices in life. Mickey Mouse was a choice. It was like a new alternative way to send messages through a talking mouse. Like, that's okay, that's interesting. The other part of the hypothesis generation engine that we focus a lot on is it's not just the ability to generate choices and hypotheses, but it's also the ability to load them into your Oculus headset and walk around a world in which that choice already has been executed. That's akin to vision in a sense that do you have a really good ability to load that one branch of this imaginative tree, this one hypothesis into a simulation and then explore what the world looks like with this in place?\n\n(00:22:23):\nIf you look at this coaching thing, it's going on at Canva instead of managing, you load that in the simulator and you're like, \"Boy, this looks pretty nice. This is higher-performance thing.\" With advocacy instead of regulation, we have growth. There's a whole bunch of aspects that are inherent in that approach where science, and if you ask a neuroscientist, would that work better? They'd be like, \"Oh, hell, yeah. That would work way better.\" Because it activates this in the brain, it reduces cortisol, it does all these things that science knows work much better. There's a whole list of stuff from very deep to very tactical of things we can do differently that reduce the gap between what you're doing and what science knows and the dysfunction just shrinks and shrinks and shrinks as you do those things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\nAre there things that you've found people can change in the way they work based on the way the brain operates, whether it's run better meetings, be better influence? What are some things people can try to do this week that will make them more successful at their work or working with colleagues?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:23:32):\nIn the list of what science knows and what business does, everything is in there. Culture is in there, meetings are in there, goals are in there, deadlines are in there, team dynamics, all this stuff is in there. We'll probably just pick a few things out of that very long list. Meetings are a good one. Meetings, I forget what the statistic is, but it's some insane 12-figure amount of, no, not 12, nine-figure, no, 12-figure, hundreds of billions' amount of waste is caught in meetings. We spend gazillions of dollars on waste of time and meetings. For us, like in our programs, the average delta is between 10 and 20%. People save anywhere from a full half of a day to a full day per week of work as a result of just cleaning up the way they're using meetings. Some of that is just the design of meetings, like treat meetings like a product and treat them workflows that should be organized and used intentionally, but a lot of it is inside the meeting, like what's the tactic?\n\n(00:24:38):\nHere's something super tactical, which is, meetings, generally speaking, are a combination of priming and decision making, if you look at meetings through the lens of the phases that they are. A lot of meetings skip the priming step altogether. They launched directly into decision making. It would be safe to skip the priming step if we began the meeting under the assumption that everybody here is on the same page, has the same information, and generally speaking, intends for the same outcome. I think that's a ludicrous assumption for most meetings, and yet most people are actually shocked to find out that we're not on the same page even though we literally never have been, and as long as you're on day two plus of working together. It's a crazy thing that we don't do priming, and priming can be simple. It can even be done in the invite. One of the things that's crazy about Outlook and Google is you can put a very terrible useless meeting into Outlook and it will never look at it and be like, this is probably useless.\n\n(00:25:46):\nJust like you can go into Trello and put the dumbest project in the company's history into Trello, it will ingest anything you put into it without any discernment as to its value. Now, imagine we're going to have to do this ourselves for now until a better calendar comes out, but imagine if Outlook or Google Calendar or Cron, which now is part of Notion, would just be like, \"Uh, uh, uh. What is the point of this meeting?\" You could say, \"Okay, this is here. This meeting is about the generation of options or creative problem solving or very tactical problem solving or efficiency seeking, or what is the category of conversation we are about to have? What are some of the basic principles that should apply? Are we honoring sacred cows or are we eating sacred cows in this meeting? What is the mode mentality, the priming? How can we all say this is the mindset and the ultimate purpose that applies to the meeting?\"\n\n(00:26:52):\nYou can write that and you can read that in under three minutes. It's not some arduous process. Amazon does it in an arduous process, they're known for that. That's wisdom to know, like we need priming. They're wise enough to realize the need for it. They make that a very robust execution. It doesn't have to be that robust. Skipping priming is pretty bad. Other meetings get the priming and the decision-making backwards. We start to open the meeting. You've heard of diamond-shaped thinking, let's open the meeting with expansionary thought and let's end the second half of the meeting with convergence. Well, we start the meeting instead with convergence, realize that we can't reconcile the various party in the room, their needs for convergence.\n\n(00:27:39):\nThen you might hear in the middle of a meeting like, \"Well, let's start over again and remember why we're all here.\" We do the priming in the second half of the meeting just in time for the meeting to end. That's a super obvious thing that people can do, but that people very rarely do in priming. I'm happy to generate a list so we don't have to talk through everything, but maybe make some little PDFs or something that people can download that say, \"Here's what great priming looks like.\" Then when you move to the decision making, here's what great decision making looks like, and that way, you can have a little bit of a guide, and again, do your own math, what science knows what we're doing in this meeting. We're skipping a bunch of steps, that's growing the probability of dysfunction or things will going wrong, and let's shrink that probability instead of growing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\nAmazing. That'd be sweet if you have that. We'll definitely link to that on the show notes. The advice here is make sure when you're starting a meeting, running a meeting, prime everyone around the problem we're trying to solve or we're trying to get out of this meeting, the context, versus just diving into decision making.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:28:44):\nVery notably, the principles that apply. I think that's really, really important, not just what we're here to do, but how we can think about this best. You can even have a debate about the principles, and it's way better to have a debate about the principles than it is to have a debate about the tactics that are rooted in the fact that you have super misaligned principles. If somebody is trying to make the decision with speed in mind and another person is trying to make the decision with accuracy in mind, it is completely inevitable that they're about to have a cat fight in the meeting. It's not resolvable until they come back and revisit the fact that deeper down, we are approaching this in a completely different mentality with completely different objectives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):\nAwesome. If you end up having these PDFs of waste to prime successfully, that'd be great.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:36):\nFor sure. Will do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):\nOkay, great. Other things that people can do to work with better. I know you have some advice on how to influence more effectively. I know you have some advice around strategy and vision, so maybe we go into those two directions.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:29:50):\nLet's start with strategy and vision, because I think it's nice to be better at strategy and vision before you start influencing people. What you'll encounter in life, in your mind, is ideas are swirling. Whether you're generating those ideas or other people are, is your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable. You can come up with your own words for that, but that's like a starting point, which is if somebody says something you've already experienced, it's something that is believed to your brain. If we said we should implement an OKR framework and you've experienced it in a prior workplace or you've read all about Google doing it, then you're going to be like, \"Yeah, we should. It would clean up a lot of junk around here. Okay, great.\" Your brain is already in a yes.\n\n(00:30:47):\nIf it's believable, maybe you're reading Harvard Business Review and you're reading about things that your business has never done, that you've never done, but there's all this evidence that it works and it makes sense to you mechanically, so you're like, \"Okay, yeah, I find that believable.\" Now we're leaning toward yes, or we're still in the yes bucket. Now we get into these unbelievable, yet maybe conceivable. These are the things that seem to be far-fetched. Going back to the Canva conversation, the conversation with Uri that you had. Most of the things that are totally believed by these leaders are unbelievable to most other leaders. We don't need managers? I don't believe it. Now we've shifted the mind from inbuilt kind of tailwind to inbuilt headwind. This is why minds struggle with strategy and with vision, is that every mind based on personality we talked about earlier, that line of demarcation between believed, we all have different lived experience, so the more experience you have, the more believed you have.\n\n(00:32:03):\nThen the believable and then the unbelievable, but yet conceivable, these lines shift a lot from person to person. An idea that totally makes sense to Uri, he's probably been in a thousand meetings where other people are like, \"That'll never work.\" Even though obviously, science knows, for example, it totally will. One of the great benefits of science in culinary school is let's not reinvent ideas that are already proven. We already know that certain things activate people's purposeful state and the full brain that seeks comprehension seats deeper problem solving, seeks human connection. Those are known things, and the same thing as the debate about the value of design sits in the strategy and vision. How do we know there's an ROI to a better design here? Well, if you could disprove that instead of proving it, because the last million people who asked this question proved it.\n\n(00:32:54):\nIf you could disprove it, you'd probably win a Nobel prize for being the first human to disprove something that is like ironclad. Like, we're done. We're done with this debate. That, I think is what we have to recognize in ourselves. Big part of self-awareness is where our unbelievable threshold begins, where our believable threshold ends. Then the inconceivable is like, get out of my office level stuff. A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem. I think it's a really, really important thing for companies and individuals to invest in themselves to kind of say, \"Do I have the capacity to recognize the situation that I find inconceivable, but that could be totally wrong?\" Then we can avoid the months potentially of arguing that sit between us and experimentation.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:34:00):\n... that sit between us and experimentation. So I think that's the starting point for that. And if we were to do paint by numbers on that, what dominoes do you want to knock down? Know your personality, what you're looking for in the Big-5 model which we lean into is openness. If you are low in openness, your brain essentially has abstract, creative, intellectual, complex thinking wired to the pain systems of the brain. That's how your wiring is. As soon as things get abstract, not only are you like, I don't like this, you have a much more visceral negative response to these types of ideas, and you are now going into your pain cave while somebody else in the room may have all that abstract, creative, exploratory thinking wired to their reward systems.\n\n(00:34:55):\nSo that's something to really know, and vulnerability is the best approach to this because if you think about the domino two, once you know this stuff, then the question is how do we socialize this knowledge in a team? Let's say it's a C suite, a leadership team, a founder and co-founder and the rest of the leadership team. And we work a lot with YC companies on this here, because it's super important. As they hire people, every incremental hire is an increment of psychological diversity, and it changes everything about how these conversations go.\n\n(00:35:27):\nSo knowing this, okay, what are our options to socialize this knowledge? Vulnerability is the best option. But Brené Brown will sell vulnerability for its own sake, not everybody buys selling vulnerability for its own sake, because it's a scary thing. But it gets a little less scary when we consider how much scarier our alternatives are. I can pretend to hide this, that's my other option, or I can not hide it, be a Tasmanian devil, and then be unapologetic. So those are your three options, and when you realize I can be vulnerable, I can attempt to hide it, or I can be unapologetic, those other two options are ruinous compared to vulnerability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):\nThe thing you said about openness and not being good at big vision, brainstorming, super resonates with me, because that's exactly me. So I took your test, what is it called? What do you call this test, by the way?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:27):\nCORE identity is what we call it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nCORE identity test.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):\nOkay, cool, and we'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:36:32):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):\nSo I took, it's basically the Big-5, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and formerly known as neuroticism, now called need for stability. I'm looking at it right here. And I'm actually, and I knew this about myself, I'm pretty low on openness, which I don't like to see, but it very much aligns with exactly what you said, I'm not great at big vision thinking. Like when people propose, say a designer on my team proposes this whole redesign big vision rethink of the way we, I'm like, no. It's my pain cave, like you said, and that's exactly what this test reflects.\n\n(00:37:10):\nSo I think it's a really powerful example of just understanding this is the way your brain is going to respond to things that are totally out there, inconceivable, or how would you call it? Somewhat conceivable but not necessarily believable, and that being aware that that's how your brain works is really powerful, being aware other people have a very different experience with that is very powerful. And your advice here is one, this combination of this habitat, create this habitat where you have all these versions of people's ways of thinking, where some people are in their happy cave when they're thinking big, and then along those lines, your point about vulnerably sharing, hey, this is me, I am low in openness, people need to understand this on my team, and let's work together to not let that hinder us. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:38:04):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, because if you think about these ideas as pegs in holes, we're going to take a creativity shaped peg and try to put it through a more pragmatic shaped hole, there's a translation problem there, and it's a huge burden. If the team actually needs to be innovative, it's a huge burden just in terms of time spent on that translation, to translate the visionary strategic ideas that are accurate but are inconceivable into ideas that feel believable for those who need that more grounded thing.\n\n(00:38:45):\nAnd of course the most common scenario here is ROI, which is the classic question to ask about any idea, what's the ROI? Well, if the idea is inherently generating nth order effects instead of first order effects, like what is the ROI of having fresh flowers in the lobby of a Four Seasons hotel? There's two possibilities for the Four Seasons, they either have an answer to that question which satisfies the pragmatic shaped hole, or they have said in their habitat, we don't ask those types of questions because they're a huge waste of time.\n\n(00:39:28):\nAnd if you're thinking about a competitive market, most of the people that you interview are in highly competitive markets, the team that spends less time translating satisfactory language before they move, which inevitably they'll move, and sometimes they'll move because the market forces them to. They spend so much time locked up in the ROI conversation or the justification, the translation conversation, that eventually customers start leaving, employees start leaving, and they're like, oh, okay, it's becoming more believable now. Well, because moved out of the realm of ideas into the physical world that we can see right in front of us.\n\n(00:40:05):\nAnd that team, because they got stuck in the translation phase instead of the experimentation phase, has a huge disadvantage in the market, and if you're competing head-to-head with one team, this is what I loved about the Figma conversation, that habitat inherently is built for speed because the habitat itself, words are tattooed to your brain that are like, we will not spend time in the translation phase, we will not spend much time. And we see this a lot in the interplay between finance departments, product departments, and things like that, where an overpowered CFO can start asking questions for which there are no answers, that just we're dragging the team into a different language that is much more literal than the more experiential language of the business, so you can see this play out all the time.\n\n(00:40:59):\nBut I think vulnerability is great because if you are sitting in a meeting, you Lenny, and you say, this is not my thing, basically everything you're saying is inconceivable, now I'm being honest with you, nobody's going to hate you for being honest, they're actually going to be glad that you are honest about the gap instead of glad that you are super certain that you are the right human to index off of in the decision-making process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nAnd the thing you recommend being open about is this is my personality, this is my CORE identity, I don't know the language you'd use, but it's not I think all this is inconceivable, it's I think all this is inconceivable because this is the way I think.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:41):\nAbsolutely, yeah, unpack the detail, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nGot it.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:41:43):\nYeah, I mean tell people, this takes my brain, all this abstract and creative future-centric thinking that's not rooted in the concrete is where my brain goes, alarms go off and I'm like, I need something concrete. So if you can give me something concrete, I'm more comfortable, but at this point I have to maybe move into a lot of trust, and trust may be my alternative to agreement, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nYeah. And there's also, I imagine, what I always do is I recognize, hey, I'm not amazing at this, let me push myself to be more open to these things and find partners that are really good at this and let them drive the ship more.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:42:26):\nYeah, and it's great, one of the things that's so cool about the YC teams that we work with is they're so sophisticated and so smart. So even though they might run into this roadblock, A, they're going to do exactly what you just said and they're going to push themselves. You may notice in your profile the dot that you scored is surrounded by rings that represent how hard it is for you to push yourself to think in different ways, to think beyond the home base way of your brain working.\n\n(00:42:55):\nNow at a certain point your brain breaks and you move into foreign territory, and there's a level of, I mean, if you are a very conservative person and somebody's like, \"Let's go to Burning Man,\" that will break your brain. You don't go all the way to the other side of the spectrum necessarily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):\nFor the record, I've been four times, even though I'm apparently low in openness.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:17):\nPerfect, and there's lots of reasons to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):\nGot married at Burning Man. Makes me feel better about my low percentile.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:43:25):\nBut you're pushing your brain. I mean, Burning Man's actually a great example because there are a bunch of different reasons you might go. And if you go for one reason, then you're exposed to the other reasons. And that may be interesting, and you may kind of venture closer to those other reasons. You may be like, I'm going to stay in my reason bubble within the greater context of this place.\n\n(00:43:44):\nSo there's a whole bunch of... And business is no different, you can say, okay, I'm going to push myself, and I may get into these places that go beyond my brain's flexibility, where the elastic band reaches its limits, and then from there I'll trust people and I'll have people, what I was going to mention about the YC founders is so many of them are so smart that they're really able to efficiently translate what they see beyond where your band stretches into the language you feel comfortable with, quickly. Other teams do that really badly and they just accuse you of, \"Why can't you see this?\" And then you get even more stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nHow much shift have you seen in people, say they take this test and they're like, as I am, 23rd percentile in openness, do you see people move meaningfully across this if they work on these sorts of things, or is this just like, here's who you are, you're not going to change significantly?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:44:41):\nPersonally I'm more concerned with the effect on teams than on people, because if you look at this through the... I've been a four time founder, and if I look at this through how is my company working? How are my teams working? I don't need all the individuals to get to perfect, I need, especially in cases where there's this translation issue where a team is working on something and some part of that team is saying, \"Let's stop here and let's dwell here.\" If they can move enough that the team, the effect on the team is now freed up, that's what we really feel as a business.\n\n(00:45:23):\nSo to answer your question directly, people can move a lot, especially through the first three rings of that range that we depict, really, really well. Self-awareness is actually kind of the key, and self-awareness and self-consciousness, the difference here is that self-awareness is simply being intentional with your brain, whereas self-consciousness is being worried about your brain. We don't want people to be worried about their brains and insecure, we just want you to say, this is a situation in which my brain can work this way, and this is a situation where I want to push myself.\n\n(00:45:56):\nSo it's being intentional, and we talked a little bit before this episode about this instinct versus intellect duality in the mind, and essentially you're just using your intellect to either verify or improve your instinct. You're always going to have instinctive responses about risk and fear and uncertainty and doubt and need for data, and all these types of things, but then your intellect can come in and watch that part of your brain thinking and say, you're super worried about the risk of this, but it's actually pretty low stakes for us to jump in and try. So your need to stabilize that is a little misplaced, and your intellect, that's really what you're doing is saying, how much do people change? I don't really worry too much about how much they change, it's more about how much they can spot with their intellect something that's misfit to the situation, and then take what they're motivated to do, and what they choose to do, and separate them. It doesn't matter if we change your motivations, if your choice of behavior and your underlying motivation can be different from each other, that's awesome, those people are super. And we all know people like that, where you're like, I know this person is uncomfortable right now, but they're totally making it work, and I really appreciate that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):\nYeah, part of the reason I ask is, I was talking to you about this before we started recording, I want 99th percentile at all these, I just want to nail this. And I know that's not how it works, I know you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can't be amazing at everything. But that's funny my mind goes there.\n\n(00:47:28):\nJust to close the loop on this advice around getting better at vision and strategy, if I were to reflect back what I'm hearing its be very self-aware about what you are not strong at, say openness. Is that specifically the one to focus on if you're trying to figure out how to get better vision and strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:47:46):\nSo there's a whole bunch of stuff... Well, let me try to make the list simple. Openness is the biggest one because it is essentially your tolerance of vision and strategy, and the lower that is, the lower you will tolerate the abstract pieces of the puzzle, for sure. The outlandish and purely creative and rules-breaking components of strategy and vision, lack of precedence, those types of things. Now the other thing to look out for is as your conscientiousness rises, which is essentially your desire to be efficient, effective, busy, not waste time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):\nI'm high on that one.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:48:25):\nYeah, structured and organized, that is another contributor in the negative, which is it's objectively great to be a conscientious person, there are so many benefits, until we have to waste time productively, or we have to break order in organization. And then that strength that four days a week, or 28 days a month is great for you, on those days where we go and have the offsite and say, what if we blew it all up, to your example of new design, new website, blow it all up, start over again, different direction, that's where the conscientiousness is going to be like, why are we doing this? Why are we having this conversation? What's the need? This is inefficient, I could be spending my time doing something else.\n\n(00:49:09):\nAnd sometimes that'll express itself even in meetings of, I was in a meeting one time after we were acquired, this was eight or nine years ago now, and when you're a founder and you get acquired, there's a new flavor of habitat that you find yourself in with very new rituals. And one of the rituals that I find myself around a lot was the ritual of saying, we can't talk about this for the rest of our lives. And we would be about six minutes into a meeting when somebody would drop the, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives\" line, and I would look at my watch and be like, \"I didn't realize that you were terminal, I mean, why are you even in this meeting if you're about to die?\"\n\n(00:49:53):\nBecause my take on this is we are super far away from the rest of our lives right now, why are you saying that we can't talk about something for six minutes when the diminishing return of added information in the priming of this meeting, to use that again, you knowing X quadruples your decision quality, and you are resisting knowing X. Now we're going to hit a point where you knowing Y, Z, etc, we've hit a diminishing return and now I'm improving your decision quality by 1% instead of by 4x. But we haven't established any sensitivity in this room to the diminishing return curve of incremental thought and incremental information. And this is like a new habitat, I'm like, in this habitat do people really hate thought? Do people really consider themselves to be the police that watch the mean streets of intellectualism for any activity? It's just kind of crazy. But yeah, that's kind of the practical side of this, is you got to watch out and you got to be careful, and that's why I habitat is such a big deal because that's a perfect example of a well-intentioned room with mostly people that are there for the right reasons and the right outcomes, but where this normalness of saying a phrase like that, or saying, \"I disagree.\" Same meeting person goes, \"I completely disagree,\" and I was like, \"With everything?\" \"Absolutely everything.\" And I go, so let's look at the meta, the overhead camera of this meeting.\n\n(00:51:33):\nThis was the initiation of combat, that's what the brain is seeing. All the brains in the room are like, oh, fight, right? And now what are our objectives? My objective now becomes win, their objective, because they've taken a huge risk of saying, I disagree with everything, becomes win, and because they are disagreeing with a lot of stuff that they don't understand, the inevitability is they're about to be annihilated in this room where they have both said, we can't talk about this forever, and now put all of their chips onto the table to say, \"I completely disagree,\" instead of, \"I have a question,\" or, \"Can we pull that thread?\" Or, \"I don't see how these dots connect.\"\n\n(00:52:15):\nSo that on a super tactical level, there's things we say that activate the amygdala, the combat mode of the brain, versus a different choice of phrase which is going to activate the prefrontal cortex which is like, \"Hey Lenny, you're connecting these two dots, I'm not seeing how they're connected,\" logic, now let's activate the prefrontal cortex with this sentence instead of, \"Lenny, that's dumb, I completely disagree,\" let's activate the amygdala instead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):\nI want to talk about this habitat point you're making which I think is really important, but just to close the loop on the strategy vision piece, so just to give people some very tactical advice is, basically understand your personality, maybe take this CORE identity test, or something like that, understand if you're low in openness and high-end conscientiousness, maybe you're not amazing at vision and it's going to be hard for you to think big and think of it-\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:53:06):\nYeah, your brain is just going to feel agitated when you're around vision. But, I mean, you can still do it, right? You can still ask people to translate. The key tactic is, okay, it's not this you're predestined to suck, it's more if you're low and openness, especially if you're also high in conscientiousness, then recognize your native language for ideas is a mismatch for the native language of vision and really, really good strategy.\n\n(00:53:35):\nAnd then you can be open about that and you can ask for some translations, and you can ask for... I mean, trust doesn't have to be non-participation, you can actually say, it would help me trust if you could explain this gap. A great example would be a second order effect, why should we have awesome documentation? How are we going to make more money if we have awesome documentation? Great question, don't be hostile in the way you asked it, but just help me understand, what thread are we pulling? Well, we're pulling this thread of customer satisfaction, retention, recommendation, et cetera, Stripe is really good at this, especially from the early days, that great documentation justifies all sorts of second order effects that then will lead us to this first order effect you're asking about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:20):\nAwesome, okay, that's really great. And I was going to go one direction, but I want to talk about this real quick. Something that comes up a lot on this podcast is the power of leaning into strengths and not feeling like you have to be amazing at everything, and that in this example, I have a low openness, high conscientiousness, I can still be very successful in the role by, in my opinion, leaning into things I'm actually really strong at, say conscientiousness, and I'm also high in agreeableness. I don't like the sound of that. Thoughts on just, it's okay if you're not amazing at vision because your openness is low, but you can be better at other stuff and together you can be really successful no matter how your personality.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:55:03):\nAbsolutely right, yeah. I mean, the truth is we look at, taking that Canva example of coaches and managers, not only does that change the way an employee feels about the way this connection they have is invested in them, but it also changes inherently a lot of the meeting dynamics and teaming dynamics from hierarchical feeling things manager to more mesh based intellect. And within the mesh, you don't have to worry too much about the hierarchy anymore. You can say, this is the nature of my contribution.\n\n(00:55:39):\nSo even in the vision and strategy piece, maybe your contributions to idea generation, there are going to be some, and they're probably going to be good. But those are not ideas to protect in the state that you brought them to the table, they're ideas to set on the table so that people can surround them and improve them. And then as other people contribute ideas that aren't as natural to you, kind of just realize we're not in the phase yet of judging and ranking and prioritizing these ideas, that's not where we are in the overall storyline. So let it happen, and then if you can improve those ideas, improve them.\n\n(00:56:15):\nAnd once ideas have that early stage, that kind of like what Jony Ive described as the infancy of an idea, when it's really weak and delicate and susceptible, if you can nurture that idea to adolescence where it has a little bit of ability to defend itself, then now you're in a situation where your conscientiousness can start to think about things like how would we resource this? What sequencing makes the most sense? What is the ROI of these things relative to each other? And consider the second and third order effects, and so on. And what would the project plans, and to your point of being both conscientious and agreeable, you are this master of coordination and alignment naturally.\n\n(00:56:56):\nSo when that phase of the project begins and we have to get people bought in, high functioning together, getting on the same page, staying focused, getting the project done, all of the people that were good at the beginning with all the vision and strategy, they are just a complete disaster in that phase. That's just how things really work in the real world, and I think we're so, again, focused, like we talked about at the beginning, we alluded to the fact you have to unpack enough complexity. I love the Einstein quote, \" Make things as simple as possible but no simpler,\" and we've made things way simpler than possible in business by saying this is the right way of doing the whole thing.\n\n(00:57:41):\nIt's like, no, no, no, if you've ever lived a day in real life, building a real product, the dynamics shift a lot throughout the course of product life cycle, as an example, or really any life cycle as an example. And the peak humans as the dynamics shift are very different, peak humans. Lenny is awesome here, contributes here 10%, contributes here 98%. Evan contributes 98% here, please get Evan out of the room when it comes to these meetings, that's great. And yes, we should lean into our strengths, but not so much that we don't know our weaknesses, because another human strength on your team is the patch for the bug of your weakness. And we run buggy software in companies and we say, \"Oh, I am leaning into my strengths, I don't need to worry about my weaknesses,\" well, then you become the person who needs everything translated into your language because when your weakness flares its head up, it slows everybody else down.\n\n(00:58:41):\nSo it's really, just from an operations business fluidity perspective, a team that is highly unaware of its weaknesses is going to have a lot of slowness and a lot of problems as a result of that. They don't have to fix all their weaknesses, but be aware of them and know who is a patch to your weakness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nEvan, this is so interesting. I love that we're digging deep on this. Is there one tactical thing you could recommend for someone to become better at openness in, say, a brainstorming experience when they're doing vision, or when they're low at this, say me.\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:59:13):\nI think the best exercise for a conscientious person especially to feel more open is to become obsessed with reverse engineering. And it's to say, there's two forms of reverse engineering that I think are really helpful here. Number one would be reverse engineering against a desired outcome, to truly understand the inputs that generate that outcome. And if we think about that at a big level, like, okay, we want to win a market, what are the real inputs to deconstruct that outcome and understand what our strategy should look like to attack all of the most relevant inputs that generate that outcome? I think that's the specific form.\n\n(00:59:55):\nAnd then at a super tactical level, if you want to give feedback to somebody, and let's say, for me, I'm low in politeness, you're probably much higher in politeness than I am, and I struggled for years with feedback to generate the intended outcome. I delivered the feedback, but the delivery wasn't the intended outcome, and the way that I delivered it actually reduced the probability of the intended outcome because I was being too impolite, too direct in many cases, too harsh. And what does harshness do to the brain? Well, that's crystal clear. So what I was doing and what science knows were very different things, and that's why I failed in those cases.\n\n(01:00:35):\nBut as soon as I started closing the gap and realized I need to try harder to think about the story arc of this feedback, that becomes clearest to me how to do it when I have the intended outcome in mind for the feedback, I really would like this person to start turning the corner on this particular way of thinking. If you and I worked together and it was about openness, we'd be like, what are some things that I could do right now to increment and set the stage for a big shift in openness as time goes on that you are bought into? And that's a very, if I'm impolite and be like, \"Lenny, what's your problem? Why can't you do this? Everybody else can do this.\"\n\n(01:01:13):\nYour willingness to start turning that corner, I mean, it may be there, the safety system is activated, like, oh, bad things could happen if I don't do this, but I don't want your safety system to motivate this change.I mean, in most cases, that's an optics based change instead of a material change that will occur. And that's why a lot of people, accountability is a great example, asking for accountability is the best way to not get it, because asking for accountability activates people's safety systems, or especially saying, \"I'm going to hold people accountable.\" Then everybody's like, oh, great, we should set up a whole movie set of facade houses that pretend everything's great with no substance behind them, and that's why so many companies end up that way. But yeah, I would say that's the tactical.\n\n(01:01:58):\nThe second thing to understand about openness and reverse engineering is just situational awareness. Very few conscientious people spend, in my opinion, as a very open person, enough time immersing themselves in the reality that is every day situational awareness necessary to do their job. Simplest example of this is how many executives have ever talked to N greater than five customers? That is a... Because, well, I'm busy. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't have time to go take a world tour, which is like we don't have the rest of our lives to talk about this. I'm not asking you to take a world tour, I'm asking you to stuff into your brain enough situational awareness that the decisions you make every day that affect all those people you're not talking to are considering those people that you're not talking to.\n\n(01:02:49):\nSo less about an intended specific outcome in this case, and more about, do I really know the... I would think about this as if we think about aeronautical engineering, do I actually have an understanding of the conditions, the flight conditions, that I'm in every day in order to fly really well? And the answer to that for a lot of people is no. So reverse engineering is probably the whole category. I don't know if that makes enough tactical sense, I'm happy to be more descriptive, but that's the category I think is have you reversed engineered how to get outcomes and have you reversed engineered to predispose your mind to come up with really good ideas and good decisions, as opposed to come up with decisions that are super disconnected from reality.\n\n(01:03:37):\nGreat example being PLG, I mean, if you haven't done enough situational awareness work, you have no idea if PLG is a remotely viable strategy for growing your business. If it's remotely relevant strategy for growing your business. And company after company after company has leadership team obsessed with this concept that in principle we should be able to let people just sign up and swipe a credit card and onboard and great. No, we have a hyper technical solution, that is never going to happen, or that's not the way they do budget, or there could be any number of ways that that's not going to work out, and those are just some concrete examples.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(01:04:49):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

That's geteppo.com/Lenny.\n\n(01:05:38):\nIt feels like there's a fractal of stuff we could talk about and endless threads of things that I want to dig into. Let me shift a little bit to influence, we mentioned this a little bit earlier. I know you have a bunch of awesome advice on how to build your skill at becoming more influential, that's something a lot of listeners of the podcast, or product managers, also founders, need the skill. Who doesn't need to become better influencers? What can we learn about how to become better influencers?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:06:05):\nWe'll probably unpack a second topic and open up an off ramp here right at the beginning, but there's two things, there's influence itself and then there's relationships, and we should probably talk a little bit about relationships. Trying to exert influence through a dysfunctional relationship is not going to go great. And most human beings, especially when they go to work, are pretty out of sorts when it comes to relationships.\n\n(01:06:36):\nAnd you even hear crazy mantra like we have to each other to work together, which are like, good luck with that. I mean, just watch a text message pop up on a phone of a person who doesn't like you and watch their response time to the text message, or their Slack message, or whatever. I mean, you're talking about you've built in a multi-day, at least multi-hour delay into responsiveness purely because the relationship isn't good, and then you compound that effect over whatever size your company is. That's massive operational inefficiency just because I don't want to respond to Evan right now. So that's the one piece.\n\n(01:07:19):\nNow assuming the relationship is in place, and we'll come back to that and talk about that because a whole very actionable framework to unpack, assuming the relationship is good, I think the starting point for influence is to choose your character and choose your mode. It's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game, and you're going to be like, am I going to influence him this way as the hero or the exemplar of these things, or am I going to influence through back channels, what is my character? And everybody for your personality has a natural fit for the character you're going to select as this mode of influence, and then you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:08:00):\nThen you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast. The habitat can help a lot with this. If a founder is listening to this and you haven't created a habitat where fast influence is easy and the permission isn't there, then you're slowing the company down inadvertently by just not clarifying this with the team. So slow influence is the we'll let them find out the hard way influence. They're going off a cliff, we know they're going off a cliff. And a lot of times we find ourselves in what's called the Abilene paradox.\n\n(01:08:39):\nThe Abilene paradox is where everybody in the room knows it's a bad idea, but we're all like \"We're in.\" And the classic Abilene paradox kind of if you look up memes on Google, it'll be like the dad thinks that the kids might want to go camping. Mom doesn't want to go camping, the kids don't want to go camping. Dad also doesn't really want to go camping, but everybody's like, \"Dad probably wants us to go camping, so let's give it a go.\" And they all go and don't enjoy it. And we see that play out all the time.\n\n(01:09:09):\nAnd a lot of people will just say, \"I can't do anything. I don't have any influence in this case. We're just going to let him fail and they'll learn.\" Or this impolite person like me giving feedback the wrong way years in the past, I'm not going to sit Evan down and talk to him about this. He'll figure out on his own through failure that this doesn't work. And that can take months, that can take years, that can take a lifetime for people to learn the slow way. And it is a form of influence. You are being intentional to say, I think the world will create enough failure that adaptation will occur. That is a form of influence, just the slowest one.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd a lot of people listening probably realize, \"Oh, that's what I'm doing. How can I go way faster than just letting things fail?\" So that's where moderate influence comes in. And a great book to read for a moderate influence is the Challenger Sale. And in the Challenger Sale, what we're looking at is the concept of teaching people something. And then when they live with this new knowledge, they'll see things that they weren't seeing before. So for example, in the feedback example that we can keep using over and over again through this is, \"Hey Evan, you might want to notice people's body language while you're saying these things and here's some signs to look out for that when you've done this and you get this, that's probably a sign that people are bought in and still with you. And when you see this, that's probably a sign that people are pushing back.\"\n\n(01:10:37):\nAnd you can ask this question in that moment and you'll probably hear answers like this. So you're like giving somebody a tool that their future is going to unpack. And the Challenger Sale kind of assumes a long enough sales cycle where you're not going to land the sale in the meeting, you're not trying to close them right there. You'll teach them some stuff and you'll, \"Hey, if you see this stuff, that's a pretty clear sign that you need to take action. So why don't we call you in 30 days, and 30 days later we get on phone, \"Hey, have you been seeing this?\" And they'll go, \"Everywhere I look, I can't not see it now.\"\n\n(01:11:13):\nAnd that's how you influence a person in a few days, a few weeks, maybe a few months at worst, way faster than letting them fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\nWe actually had, I don't know if you know this, we had the author of that book on the podcast, Matt Dixon, I think his name. And the Challenger Sale, the idea there is challenge their perspective and view on what is actually real about the market and what they need.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:11:36):\nExactly. Yeah. I think yes, there's the challenge component to it, but I think the underappreciated piece of that methodology is that you're still letting that person see the world, but you've given them new information that is breaking some calcification in their brain challenge. It's not the moment of the challenge where all the magic happens. There's moments that occur later that continue kind of putting that calcium, lime and rust melting formula on this expectation or this kind of decision in their mind to the point where sometimes they'll turn around and be like, \"Thank you for even telling me this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\nSo the advice here is if you're trying to influence someone, try to figure out what they don't know. Find information that you know they may not know because once they know that and they may be like, \"Oh wow, I totally see what you're saying.\"\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:12:33):\nYeah, exactly right. And let them know it and let them live with it. Don't cram it down their throat and make them accept it If they live with it just a little bit, even just a couple days, that might be enough to come back to a much softer conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\nDoes this connect to what you said earlier, which I love this idea of pick a character, like pick your influence style based on your personality, whether it's back channeling and that makes me think of a very specific person. He's coming on the podcast actually, he's this Jedi that just gets people aligned but very behind the scenes, very the meetings before the meetings. So that's one character or it's just telling a compelling story probably in a deck. Or there's other character I guess. Does this idea of sharing information, is that a type of character or is that just something that everyone should just do because a really effective strategy?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:13:27):\nI like the idea of intentionality in just about everything. Are we letting trade winds push us into certain things or are we actually making choices? And I think that step of being intentional about your style and this kind of notion of a character is a wise step to take so that you can kind of have some guardrails as you go through this and some consistency. It helps other people understand the role you're playing in influence. If you are consistently coming from the same place, you're about that style, like I want to try to influence this organization by doing this way and you're going to see that from me over and over and over again.\n\n(01:14:07):\nYou kind of have given yourself a little permission and also you can get some buy-in from people. If you do want be more the barbarian kind of approach, you can say, \"Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy.\" Is it okay if I do that over and over and over again? And now you've bought future you the permission to approach things in certain ways that would yield meaningfully different influence outcomes, like meaningfully different. I was able to do this and it accelerated something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nSo the way I am hearing this is there are many ways to get what you want, think about your personality style and find the path that is most aligned with the way you operate.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:14:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):\nWhether it's behind the scenes, whether it's a compelling story. Awesome. So this character is basically figure out what your... It kind of comes back to leverage your strengths, what are you good at? And use that channel to convince people of the thing you want them to be convinced of.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:08):\nYep, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):\nMy mind goes to what are the list of ways, what are the character options in this list when I'm opening up the game and choosing? You went through a few, but just to give people like, oh, okay, I see I could try it this way. Is there a small list you could share of just like here's ways you could try approaching influence.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:27):\nProbably the dimensions are most valuable to people. I would say one of the dimensions is compassion, which is do I want to influence by trying to help people, by trying to make sure that we get it right and that people get value. And then the permission I'm seeking there is can I ask questions about why are we not thinking about the user right now? Why are we not concerned with the value they're getting and challenge us in that way?\n\n(01:15:59):\nI think there are characters based on logic and even belief, which is I would like to be the one to insert more knowledge and insert more causality into conversations and challenge causality in conversations to make us think harder and challenge what we believe and break up the sacred cows of the stuff we walked in the meeting with so that we feel differently about things walking out of meetings.\n\n(01:16:27):\nSo I think there's a bunch of different very useful dimensions. One could be very creativity based. If you follow this big five format, they're kind of spelled out for you. Enthusiasm, interesting dimension. I want to challenge us through the lens of what do people get excited about? What makes people feel good? Does this make people feel good? And are there tweaks we could make to the product or this marketing campaign or whatever.\n\n(01:16:54):\nLook at what Siki just did with Runway. I mean I love that guy so much and there's so many components of his character and obviously the characters he surrounded himself with that contribute to really next level stuff. And they're definitely challenging each other using these dimensions of compassion to be the character of caregiver or the character of protector. And so there's a bunch of different ways you could turn those dimensions into characters.\n\n(01:17:28):\nBut I think when you see the value of each of those perspectives, especially in product, I'm a really big fan of product. If you have dysfunctionally high compassion, dysfunctionally high openness, you have internal rewards and motivations to explore regions of product that other minds aren't exploring as intuitively. And you don't have to have the whole deck to be amazing at product. But you have some unfair advantages if you are super prone to reverse engineering just by your nature. You are going to be more situationally aware and probably make a series of vastly better decisions than the team that has a lot less situational awareness than you do. It's a huge advantage.\n\n(01:18:16):\nBut when it comes to the concept of influence. I mean figuring out these dimensions that define who you are and then using them to kind of say, \"I want the permission to ask a series of questions and challenge our thinking through this very intuitive strength that I have.\" Can we all see the value in that or do I need to further sell myself? And then you'll find you can take on that character and play that role really well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\nI imagine the ultimate unlock is that combined with what is that person's personality style and what is the best way they receive information, which is a little harder. Because you can't force them to take some tests and you can't make them give you the results. But I know a lot of teams do these tests together as a team and share the results. And so it's I guess a reminder of just that's really powerful if you and your team, especially the execs at company.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:19:09):\nYeah, exactly. And when you move into this vulnerability out of your three choices state, we don't need a bunch of data for that to work really well. If you said, \"Hey, I'm not super strong at this,\" and the rest of the room was like, well \"Wait, this other person's super awesome at this, why don't not the two of you work together,\" then it's like under 30 seconds we've unlocked potential that wasn't there.\n\n(01:19:34):\nSo you want to get business.... I kind of think of extending the video game metaphor. Not only are we choosing our characters or we are a certain character, but the business has a difficulty setting that we chose based on the habitat. And I've worked in and with way too many companies where we are playing the game in nightmare and every enemy takes a thousand shotgun shells to bring down instead of just switching the difficulty setting to easy, which is like the enemies somehow become our friends as we go through this journey.\n\n(01:20:06):\nI mean, it really can be that transformative, especially with a case like yours that you talked about. Okay, I am not as high in openness. I'm very high in conscientiousness. If I can admit this and ask different types of questions, everybody else in the room will be like the difficulty setting of this just went to zero and the speed of it just went to way higher than it used to be.\n\n(01:20:32):\nAnd we underestimate this kind of less concrete part of the business world. And I mean that's the genesis of this whole business that I was crazy enough to start after starting other companies in the past, which is like we are underestimating how much of our operational reality is a function of our human reality. And are we doing enough? Are we doing the right things to close the gap between what science knows and what business does? And do we even know what the science is? Have we educated ourselves to close the gap? And then it becomes super obvious, oh, this makes a lot of sense to be open and find the patch to my bug. And here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nThis fractal of topics continues to grow. I'm trying to contain it. There's three things I want to try to talk about in the rest of our chat, that stuff we've touched on that I think will be really useful to people. One is relationships. You mentioned there's more to talk about there just how to build great relationships. Two is I want to come back to the habitat and building a habitat that is very conducive to innovation and speed and success and those sorts of things. And then I want to talk about focus. We talked a bit about just how important focus is and how differently our brains operate in different states of focus. So maybe we start with the relationship piece just because that connects to what we were just talking about of how do we strengthen relationships, create better relationships within our teams.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:21:53):\nYeah, so we were talking about relationships kind of as this off ramp or this kind of sidecar to influence. And real quickly the fast mode of influence and relationships goes really well together. So we talked about the slow and the moderate. The fast mode of influence is cognitive dissonance. It's essentially saying in the moment, I'm not going to wait for you to experience anything. It's saying in the moment, how does this formula compute? Explain to me, Evan, how you being too blunt in feedback is going to end up in a human being changing. Why do you believe that?\n\n(01:22:29):\nAnd especially it's that second phrase of why do you believe that drill below the behavior down into the belief. What do you believe that has you doing this? And then we can explore how preposterous the belief itself is, which then bubbles up to the surface level of this.\n\n(01:22:47):\nAnd if in the environment, the habitat's a huge component of this as our relationships, which is if you have great relationships where people trust each other enough to have this kind of cognitive dissonance conversation, and we have a habitat that is very clear that we are free to discuss cognitive dissonance and logical disconnects, that is really important to do. Then you activate fast influence mode basically. So that's a really important thing. And then as you transition to relationships, well what are... The question that everybody kind of glosses over in my opinion is what is a relationship? I don't know how you feel about answering that question, but it's a really hard-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nI would just go to ChatGPT. What is a relationship?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:23:33):\nExactly, right. Yeah. At this point we have some help that we didn't use to have. But the other thing that goes along with what is a relationship is how good is my relationship with person X? Like, you and I both know Shreyas and how good is our relationship? I would say it's awesome. Why is it awesome? I don't know. It just feels great. So let's double click on a good definition and a good framework because once you actually know why a relationship feels great, that example or why a relationship feels super difficult, now we can start to build some strategies, some actual action plans for them.\n\n(01:24:14):\nSo what we propose to people is if you take that third component of your brain ability, that is one piece of your relationships, especially your professional relationships. So if you know an engineer and you have an idea of something you want to build and they have the ability to build it, their ability and their utility to you is a function of your relationship and it will contribute to the positive or negative force that you feel in that relationship. Like, wow, this person has a lot of ability. My appreciation is higher, my faith in them is higher, my cooperation with them is higher.\n\n(01:24:50):\nIf you question a person's ability or they've proven that ability is kind of unreliable, those things start to kind of vector downwards and we will pick on Shreyas through this as a good example? Because I think most of the people watching also know him. What is his ability? What is his utility? As high as I've ever seen. I mean every conversation he's intellectually conceptually additive to. You're better after you've talked to him every time. At least that's been my experience with him.\n\n(01:25:20):\nAnd we all know people like that, with various fields and various abilities. So that's one piece that's really important. And why as an individual, it's so important to invest in your ability because it is so integral to every relationship you have, particularly professional relationships and your ability, knowledge, your reasoning, your imagination, your skill set, these are all incrementable facets of you.\n\n(01:25:50):\nAnd that's really, really key. Now here's the plot twist. Your ability is actually not the most important part of a relationship, biologically speaking. There's two more that matter quite a bit more. And the surprise ending is that the third one matters the most, which is scary in some cases.\n\n(01:26:11):\nThe second factor of relationships is trust. So trust in the brain. If we go very primitive back to the amygdala that we talked about earlier, trust is simply risk. Human level risk and trust can span from strongly negative to strongly positive in a relationship. And we felt that full range with different people in our lives. Strongly negative trust is the brain saying, this person is dangerous to me. They're very likely to try to undermine me. They're very likely to not deliver something. Personal harm will occur by essentially kind of interacting in this relationship.\n\n(01:26:51):\nAnd then on the other side of trust, we kind of try to create some levels to this to keep it clean. And the fractal continues to grow a little bit, but we'll try to keep this simple. But I like to think of trust one, two and three. Three distinct levels of trust. And trust one is, let's say we're having a cookout. Trust one is Lenny, could you please bring the chips, ideally sealed, but it's a delegation of a simple non-critical task knowing that it is likely to get done and get done decently well. But it's not like this huge level of trust. It's the people that we work with where this type of delegation, and especially if people delegate under the thesis of \"I want to do the high value work, so let me put the low value work on other people.\" That's all the low value work that we put on other people, and it allows us to purify our focus on the high value work, and we don't need all the low value work to go beautifully well or be artistically brilliant.\n\n(01:27:53):\nSo trust two is when we step up to almost like \"I need to do this myself. Is there anybody who could do it as well as me?\" That there's no risk to me having them do it instead of me doing it. And that's where you get true scalability of teams. So if you can trust people enough, your brain's assessment of risk of giving this task to someone else or giving this knowledge even to somebody else, that they'll treat it the way you would treat it, is a significantly higher positive trust that you can feel in a relationship.\n\n(01:28:26):\nAnd then finally, trust three is when we do hit these breakpoints in our brain where we say the way your mind works is beyond the way my mind works on this topic. So the classic example at the cookout would be if Wolfgang Puck was a neighbor, we're going to have Wolfgang Puck do all the most critical stuff and maybe even set up the music and the decor and whatever. Or another example would be like when Steven Spielberg has John Williams score a film, he's not hoping John will do it as well as Steven would do it. He's saying, \"Just send me the bill. Try not to go too crazy.\" But he is not going to sit down with the invoice and be like, \"Why did you need 13 horns instead of 11?\" John just gets to do what John does because there's so much trust in this kind of beyond my event horizon kind of risk. It would be riskier for me to do it than for him to do it or her to do it, right?\n\n(01:29:25):\nSo that's kind of the level, but that matters more to a human being because the safety system, if it activates, your utility is sunk. So if you're an awesome engineer but you damage people, it doesn't matter that you're an awesome engineer because in the social network, the mesh of your organization, you are a node that has a protective covering around it. Information is not flowing to you the way it would normally, and delegation is not flowing to you and access is not flowing to you the way it would normally. So you are a kind of protected, deactivated, sequestered node of the mesh at this point in time. And a lot of people really don't get that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nYeah, that's a really good way of visualizing.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:30:16):\nAnd then here's the surprise ending. The last piece of every relationship that you have is appeal. Appeal is how your brain interprets the shared experiences you have with other people. Whether or not you look forward to being around that person, whether or not you like their style, the feel of what shared experiences really are. And if you think about, let's pick on Shreyas one last time. What is his ability and utility? Off the charts. To what extent can he be trusted? Trust three, off the charts. Will he ever damage somebody? I mean, not to my knowledge. He may have some really dark past that we don't know about, but as far as I've seen, not a lot of damage in his wake. And then thirdly, what kind of experience is he? He's an extraordinarily positive experience. So he naturally accumulates great relationship after great relationship after great relationship.\n\n(01:31:15):\nAnd again, if you're that great engineer with a ton of ability, now let's flip the middle dimension. And we trust you a lot, but you're a horrible experience. Are you coming to our offsite? Are you in this meeting? No, you're gone. We don't want you there. You're like a hurricane. So biologically speaking, the biggest bug in our programming as we transfer this to the business context is what makes the most sense in business is the most, if it's a meritocracy, the best people with the best knowledge that we can trust should be in the room and we will fight it with every fiber of our being if they're a terrible experience. And that's a bummer. And what's funny is you can flip it. We all either have friends or know people who have friends that you cannot trust, they have no ability to speak of, but they're a super awesome experience. What a great friend.\n\n(01:32:16):\nSo how is it that we get this thing completely flipped? And I think that's the thing. As you parse that list, as anybody listening parses that list, it's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? That is where to start? Not how good am I at my job? How much do I know? How critical am I to this process? But am I a miserable experience? And if the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet, you got to fix that first.\n\n(01:32:48):\nAnd to this point of the profile, as you parse the profile, you'll find things like obviously not a pleasant experience, like being really impolite, obviously not a pleasant experience, being super overbearing and assertive, obviously not a pleasant experience, being hyper low in openness and enacting out of that and telling everybody they're overcomplicating everything all the time. Not a great experience for people who are actually well-intentioned trying to get it right. So there's concrete things that you can do with this knowledge in mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\nThis last piece makes me think about why some of the most effective PMs are the PMs that bring a lot of energy and positivity to the team and just get people excited, which is such a soft skill, but such a powerful thing you can do for your team because people kind of look to you to lead them. I had a PM I was working with in every meeting, he is like, \"This is going to be awesome.\" He just comes right in every meeting, \"Oh, who's ready to make some decisions,\" and it really changes everything. And so this is amazing advice.\n\n(01:33:46):\nSo basically if you want better relationships, which will make you a better influencer, start with what kind of experience am I, when people work with me, ask me for stuff, ask me questions, and you shared a bunch of specific things you can do.\n\n(01:34:03):\nSomething I always tell people is just try to smile, just look happy. That makes a big difference.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:07):\nLook happy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):\nBring energy, look happy. Just try to be excited. Yeah, so if you want to build better relationships which have all these amazing trickle down effects, your advice is think about the experience you are to other people when they work with you, work on trust and ideally get to the place that third level of you are doing it better than them. But that's a high bar for all things. And then the last thing is, are you actually amazing? Work in your abilities, that's kind of the last piece.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:38):\nYeah, exactly. And it's not that none of these become unimportant because the other are kind of the gateways. I mean your relationships require all three, especially your professional relationships. So yeah, it's more just like if experience is the only thing undermining you when you're otherwise very trustworthy and very skilled and able, that's a shame. Just fix it.\n\n(01:35:03):\nAnd there's a whole bunch of ways to go about that. But I like to leave that to people to explore that creatively. Like well, \"Oh gosh, okay, I can change this to this to this.\" On the trust thing, do you hurt people? I mean, that's it. Do people have a reason to believe that you are risky or dangerous? And unfortunately in a lot of habitats, the habitat itself either allows or even rewards people that are super untrustworthy to play the system in advance of the system. And as you talk to Jeffrey about the power conversation, the worse the habitat, the more his suggestions work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\nI could see that.\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:35:49):\nAnd the reason that he's correct, he used the phrase, \"This is how the world always has been, is how it is, and it's how it always will be.\" Well, it's how the normal dysfunctional world always has been, is and will be. And if you want people in your organization to rise on merit and for influence to work to generate better decision-making, make better products, have a better company, move faster, et cetera, you need to create a habitat where what Jeffrey's observed about the normal dysfunctional world largely doesn't work within your habitat. So if it's effective for people to harm each other in your habitat, you are performing at a much lower level than if harming each other was extremely ineffective. And that's up to you as a leader, as a manager, et cetera. And then of course, skill is what it is. It's your ability to convert your intents into outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\nI'm glad you're talking about habitat, that's exactly where I wanted to go. So just two more things I want to spend our time on, habitat and focus, how to create more space for focus and get better focus. So you've touched on this many times at this point, this idea of a habitat. I think another way to think about this is the culture of your company. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):\nOkay, cool. So are there a few things you could recommend to people to create a habitat that is conducive of good stuff?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:15):\nLet's start at the start here. So in the difference between what science knows and business does, let's kind of zero in on the fact that the way most companies approach culture has a very shaky track record. Like if mission, vision, values was an airline, you would not allow any family to fly on that airline. It does not arrive at most of its intended destinations. That is just a super important starting point because I'm going to kill a sacred cow here while we talk about this. And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm trying to be mean or anything. It's just it's worth looking at stuff that doesn't work and wondering if there's something that could work a lot better. So if we look at habitat and culture, it's really about what people believe. It's what people believe is acceptable, permissible, productive, and the biggest flaw in people's approach to culture. And interestingly enough, even at YC, they talk about this mission, vision, values, culture, stuff that comes later, let some stuff happen with the business that comes later. They're right to say that if that's the paradigm you're going to use because it's not going to work either way. So you might as well do it later.\n\n(01:38:31):\nBut if you're going to do it the right way and investigate human beliefs, and we talked about priming for example, culture is just the macro priming of the entire business of what your central belief systems are and then the permission that forms from those belief systems. So if you've done that really well, you should do that right at the very beginning. In what way should we approach this company, building this, working together, et cetera? That would be really, really helpful to get right from day one. And the belief system that people have, there are two approaches to changing people's beliefs.\n\n(01:39:10):\nMission, vision, values is what we call a performative approach. Meaning I'm going to come up with some expression of an inspiring mission, inspiring values and inspiring vision, and it's going to be performed well enough. It's going to be like if we were busking in the park, this is going to be a cool enough mission, vision, values that people throw some change into my guitar case and they buy into it, they gather around. And I think that's just completely the wrong approach because we're hoping to inspire people. We're hoping to be artistically talented enough to pull that off. The other approach is to be deductive, logically deductive, which is centrally speaking. There is hopefully a market out there that's glad our company exists, who is glad we exist, why are they glad we exist? And that's shifting our mission into something that we call your role, the role you play in the world around you.\n\n(01:40:08):\nWho is glad you exist? Why are they glad you exist? And that is a fact. That is not an inspiring idea. That is like, okay, we work with this company that does AI-based optical character recognition, document ingestion, et cetera. Why is the world glad that they exist? Well, because we get 95% of the documents scanned into structured data that normally people have to transfer by hand. That's pretty compelling. Why is the world glad Warby Parker exists? Because before you used to choose between looking dumb and it being cheap and looking cool and it being expensive, and now you can look cool and it's cheap. The world's really glad we exist.\n\n(01:40:50):\nNow that's true. I don't need you to be inspired to believe that that is true. And now everything that we're going to think about for the rest of our beliefs, we're going to deduce from that. So we're just going to use logic to build our culture, not inspiration. So this next thing we need to figure out is how can we understand the specific value that's created when we play this role in the world? We save people money, we save people time, we open up markets, we help people explore possibilities and potential they couldn't tap into otherwise, etc.\n\n(01:41:21):\nSo what's the role of Core? People are glad we exist because we tap into potential they had no access to before. And at the team level, at the company level, that could be a really big deal. So we know that and we say, \"Okay, well gosh, that implies so much.\" There's so much we got to do now what value does that produce? And then I could say, okay, once we understand the definition of value, which comes out of our role, now we can change the definition of done. So a lot of teams talk about bias to action. And hamsters have bias to action. They get up out of their straw and they turn that wheel as hard as they possibly can and they go absolutely nowhere. But if you understand the role you play-\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:42:01):\nBut if you understand the role you play in the world, and you understand the value you produce in terms of time savings, cost savings, upside, whatever it is that you do, then you can say, \"We should have a bias to impact, not a bias to action. We shouldn't just do stuff, we should have an effect that has the result of value creation. We should save people time.\" And now when you're a product team, looking at this, and you're saying, \"Well, here's a cool new idea, Lenny, let's do this.\" You can now use that as a habitat level permission to be like, \"Oh, how does that produce value for people? How does that make people go faster, save time, get smarter, do something they couldn't do otherwise?\" And then you can still use that exact same vocabulary when you go sell it to them, \"This is how it makes you faster, smarter, more efficient, save cost.\"\n\n(01:42:50):\nSo it's like really logical deduction. And if people think that we should do something, build a product that doesn't create value. Now instead of being inspiring, we can be logical. We don't build things that produce no value, that is not a priority until we can turn it into something that does produce value. So you're turning culture into something highly usable, in getting away from performative culture into logical deductive culture. And I think that's really, really the key for most people is to say, \"Let's understand why the world's glad we exist.\" That's why we have a team, that's why we have customers. And what does that imply about our standards for ourselves when we execute in value creation? Even down to the email. If I send some wonky email reply to somebody's question and it doesn't produce value for them, I'm not done. I need to finish the job until it produces value for them.\n\n(01:43:43):\nQuality standards are baked into this, that again is implied. Would I be happy that Warby Parker exists, if they shipped me something that's a two out of 10 in quality? No. So we can't make things that are two out of 10. And everybody has a belief. There are plenty of people that probably interview at Warby Parker that think, two out of 10 is perfectly fine, just get it to them. And no, we need an antibody to that belief. We have decision-making intelligence, which everybody believes we should go fast, break stuff, or we should be super slow, and get everything right and wherever in between. That's a fun one to talk about. And then finally, you have a teaming dynamic belief, which is essentially every single human's belief of what is acceptable treatment of other human beings. What state does that put the other human in?\n\n(01:44:35):\nAnd a lot of people, particularly like I'll pick on myself with the low politeness, will spend years thinking, \"I'm giving honest feedback quickly. This is efficient.\" And you're like, \"How is it efficient when it takes people six months instead of six minutes to act on your feedback because they just don't like you so much, and you have this appeal problem that keeps you out of all the rooms?\" Actually your utility, which, your politeness is a utility transferred mechanism, but we don't want you in the room. So you're not a business benefit in this case. So that's kind of the starting point. That's ground zero of habitat is do not build an habitat on the roots of inspiration. It doesn't work. It can work, right? If you do it super inspiring stuff and you're super inspiring people, then you probably have the artistic ability to pull that off. But even then, you'd still be better off if you would do it through logical deduction instead of inspiration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):\nSay someone is like, \"Okay, I'm going to improve my habitat, I'm going to improve my company culture. Or I'm just going to start setting up a good habitat.\" What's something they can do? What can they do today, this week, to just start to do that? Is it, sit down and think about what is the value we provide? Why do we exist? Is there something else you'd recommend?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:45:54):\nSo the brain craves an answer to the question, why am I doing this? And not only are there things we should start doing, but I like to deepen the commitment in people's minds to what we should start doing, by thinking of it as, we should start doing things that we've been negligent in doing, right? Not just, oh, this would be even better, but we are actually causing some habitat problems by being negligent in certain things. So the primary thing that people are negligent in is answering the question, why should I do this, to their team. And saying, you should do this because it's your job is a form of negligence, right? You're not actually answering that question in any useful way. Because I could also answer that in the safety way, which I sort of just did by saying, it's your job. I'm implying that there's a consequence. But I could be like, because if you don't, here's the specific bad things that will happen.\n\n(01:46:52):\nYou could be giving them a why in terms of reward, because, oh, if you do this, you get this, or if we do this, we get this. But you could also be giving them a purposeful answer to why, which is not a form of negligence, which is to say, because our work actually matters. There are people out there waiting on us to ship this product to improve their situation, and they also want us to get it right at the same time. So bias to impact through that lens. We do need to ship this. It needs to happen, and it needs to be right, or at least right enough in its first version.\n\n(01:47:28):\nSo if you have been negligent, and we all have at times, right? I'm not trying to judge, but I'm trying to convict, right? To build some conviction, to build some commitment. If you have been negligent in answering to all these minds that work with you, why we're even doing this. That's the starting point, is make sure everybody knows why. And that why is a shared why across the team. And not just the Simon Sinek big picture why? I mean, very specific why. That for my team, when we build training materials, when we look at it through that lens of, if we get this right, this is what happens to teams, and companies, and products and their customers.\n\n(01:48:12):\nThere's a through line at the big deal and that's why we can't do it this way, or that's why we should get more obsessed with quality, and why we should get more interdependent as a team and stop doing things that are just our own ideas. But say, \"Hey Lenny, I'm thinking about doing it this way. Is there anything you'd add before I hit go?\" And then you'd be like, \"Oh, I think it would be 10% better if you did it this way.\" And then now our product is 10% better. So that's kind of the square one is ask yourself, when's the last time our team had a conversation about why we're even doing any of this? What value it produces? Who is affected by our decisions? And if that hasn't happened in a while, that's not good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:57):\nIs another way to think about this, your mission, is that a term?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:49:02):\nYeah, I think it's an alternative to mission, I try... And I don't want to stomp all over mission, vision, values because I think they can work. But I think it's easier for people to conceptualize the importance of their work, if they understand, we are playing a role, not fulfilling a mission. And role implies obligation. There's no obligation in mission, unless you feel the inspiration so powerfully. And these differences are subtle, but neurologically, it's different. If I tell your brain, \"Here are the people counting on you to get this right, Lenny.\" Your brain activates a region called the anterior insular cortex, which starts to think about other people in the context of the solution you're creating.\n\n(01:49:45):\nAnd if I say, \"We are here to change people's lives through this,\" in a more general sense, your prefrontal cortex will still activate to solve the problem, but your anterior insular cortex will not, to more deeply consider the humans affected by the problem. So you're kind of adding to the toolkit of what the brain will bring to the table to generate solutions. And if you activate more good regions of the brain, you get better solutions. So I lean into this. Personally, I'm like, \"You really don't need a mission statement. You need to understand the role you play, and people need to have some response, some physiological, like, 'I get it, to my actions impact people.'\" And if they don't have a response, you should go find a human who does, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:35):\nOne last thread I want to follow, focus. You have some really cool advice on how to help. And this just comes from everybody wants to get better focus. Everyone wants their team to have more time for focus. Everyone wants their engineers to sit there and build things faster, their designers to get stuff done. And it all comes from getting really good at focus and creating space for focus on your team. What advice do you have for folks that want to personally learn to focus better, and to help their team have more time for focus, get stuff done essentially?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:51:10):\nI mean, isn't this the question? Because this is where it all ends, right? First things first, let's look at the neuroscience that we have available to us. Which is, the study of focus either is or is tightly associated with the study of what's called brain waves. That's becoming a lot more popular. We're seeing it even in athletes, like professional golfers, or studying how their brain waves are focused on the golf shot and which mode to put the brain into to play golf at the highest level. Same thing applies to work. There's a bunch of different kind of bands of brain waves. Most of them actually are when you're asleep. So your REM cycles, your deep sleep cycles, your kind of drowsy cycles, those are brain waves. You can feel your brain turning off, you can feel your brain turning on when you dream. But when you're awake, there's really three primary modes that your brain is in.\n\n(01:52:03):\nThe nerdy side of this, kind of the nerdy language is alpha, beta and gamma. Those are the distinct ranges of brain activity, and they basically represent how focused your brain is. So alpha is quite simply daydreaming. So your brain is very quiet and empty. Easy metaphor is if you're in your house at night and everything's quiet, you hear things that you don't hear during the daytime, and that's what alpha is like in the brain. Your brain is actually working subconsciously a lot. But when you're busy, which is beta, your brain is too noisy to hear any of those little creaks and pops in the house. But when you're in alpha, you hear stuff.\n\n(01:52:41):\nSo the most common setting for alpha for most people is the shower. So it unlocks this mystery of like, why do I have all these ideas in the shower? Well, it's because your brain is in alpha. It hears these little creaks and pops inside of the attic, and it unpacks them. He goes, \"Oh, that's an interesting idea,\" it comes out of nowhere. It can be driving, gardening, car washing, cycling, whatever. As long as there's not too much cognitive load, then you can be daydreaming. And I'll come back to this in a second because there's a big permission problem at the habitat level for some of these focus levels.\n\n(01:53:14):\nBeta is productivity mode. So if you've ever seen somebody with a poster on their back wall that says, \"Get shit done,\" that's basically just a poster that says beta on it. I love beta. And answer emails, have meetings, write code. And there are some gamma code, deeper thinking scenarios where you're writing code, delivering presentations, making presentations. So much of our workday is beta, and it's just... I mean, some of us have an infinite amount of demand for beta work. There's just a never ending stream of stuff we could do and get done.\n\n(01:53:55):\nAnd then gamma is your brain's intense focus. So if you're learning something really complicated, you're learning thermodynamics in college or something like that, and you're just like, \"Wow, this is not easy.\" And you have to really push your brain to grapple with these concepts, connect the dots, even remember certain things, that's gamma. And we feel that sometimes at work, that here's a problem, a complex issue that we could tackle in beta by slapping duct tape on it, or we could tackle in gamma by reverse engineering, and going deep. And that's where we start to connect the dots that we talked about earlier, that focus and reverse engineering are related. That in beta, you have no intention to learn anything new to get something done, to think more deeply to get something done, to reconsider an existing process, or structure, or framework in your mind to get something done, you're going to utilize those things to get something done.\n\n(01:54:52):\nGamma is where we go, \"I would normally do it this way. I can see why that's not the right way. I need to make something new. I need to break my framework and build a brand new one right now to do something.\" So we generally spend too much time in beta in work, and that's both a judgment call, because I certainly have my own opinion about beta. I call it the conscientiousness crisis, which is conscientiousness wants beta, openness wants gamma. I'm kind of thinking of tying these pieces together. And it's not that conscientiousness is inherently a crisis, but when you meet teams that haven't done any innovation, haven't rethought the market, have become insensitive to changes in the environment around them, have become insensitive to their own employee problems and are still just kind of like this locomotive that keeps on going, irrespective of what's going on around it. It's that heads-down form of conscientious beta, that feels like, \"Now's not the time, let's stay focused, let's stay focused,\" et cetera.\n\n(01:55:53):\nSo we don't want to get rid of beta, we got a lot of work to do. But let's put a rule of thumb out there for people to explore, because it's going to be subjective to every team and every company. But as a rule of thumb, if 25% of your year is spent in gamma and alpha, you're probably a lot better off than the teams who spend less than 25% of their year thinking deep, and being in this more daydreaming mode. So what I wanted to circle back on is, how could we possibly daydream productively? Well, that's preposterous. And this is where you can build in your mind... And I do have another PDF for this, if people want to see it.\n\n(01:56:32):\nBut you can build in your mind a 3 x 3 grid where we have the safety system, reward, and purpose system in columns. We have alpha, beta and gamma in rows, and we basically have a list of nine channels that the brain can activate to generate different types of thinking. And most of the companies out there, most of the teams out there, are primarily, all their programming comes from safety beta and reward beta. How can I be busy to get rewards, ROI, customers, deals, whatever? Even promotions, more self-centered kind of rewards? And beta safety, which would be, how can I be busy? Optics, manage my reputation, avoid risk, that sort of stuff?\n\n(01:57:19):\nThe crisis is basically realizing, spending too much time in those two out of our nine available boxes, is probably not generating anywhere near the ideal outcomes. And if we could instead shift to the purposeful column by answering that brain's craving for why, with an answer that explains, it's not about you, it's not about us, it's about other people are counting on us to get this stuff right, does that matter to you? Because for most people, they're like, \"Yeah, that's actually really cool. I can have an impact on real stuff happening in other people's lives and in the world outside of me?\" So that that activates, now all of a sudden we can say, okay, let's look at alpha across the top row.\n\n(01:58:06):\nAlpha safety is when you get in the shower, and all of your anxieties, worries, et cetera, come out of nowhere, out of the attic of your mind. What happens in alpha reward? It's when you have these breakthroughs of how to get a deal, how to win something. It's daydreaming, but your brain is primed to daydream in a certain way, whether it's about anxiety or anger, or whether it's about rewards you care about. If it's purpose, this is where from a vision perspective, a possibilities product perspective, you're going to have all sorts of crazy cool ideas pop into your mind if you've primed your brain to being purposeful and then you daydream.\n\n(01:58:44):\nAnd you can do this in the middle of a day. Certain companies, it's easier than others. But if you can push away from your desk, and just go sit in a park or something for 10 minutes, 20 minutes and calm your brain down, listen, something cool will probably happen in your brain. I can't guarantee that, but you have to experiment with it to find out how it works for you. And then the same thing for gamma, when you hear phrases like, \"We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives,\" that is the gamma prevention team kicking the door down and saying, \"We're here to get you back into beta. Everybody, put your hands behind your backs,\" sort of a thing.\n\n(01:59:22):\nAnd that's where the habitat and the focus kind of matters because you will not ever get a gamma idea from a beta mind. You will never get an alpha idea from a beta mind. So if your business needs some breakthrough, daydreaming, interesting ideas in order to create adjacencies to build new products, to seek new markets, to better fulfill the role you're playing within this market, then team has to have permission to enter that intellectual focused state, or that you're turning that channel off. You're taking that off of the programming available through your particular subscription.\n\n(02:00:04):\nAnd the same thing applies to gamma. The habitat basically needs to establish that gamma is a viable channel for a lot of work, and there's permission to go into it. You can certainly overdo it. That's why I say 25%, you don't need to spend half of your year, three-quarters of your year in gamma. It bonkers how smart you can be if you spend three or four hours in an afternoon in that deep-focused state, you'll just do stuff you'd never do. And if you can get the team to have off-sites that are gamma-focused, everybody's scatter and be alone, and do this stuff that are gamma and alpha-focused, that are productive and you bring ideas back. You're just simply going to generate thinking and outcomes that you wouldn't otherwise. And it may be that 10 percent's right for you. It may be that 30 percent's right for you, depending on how dynamic your market and customer base are. But just to challenge yourself with the question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:00:58):\nThis stuff is so fascinating, I wish we had another hour just to dig deep into this. Because it feels like just this alone is going to really transform the way companies operate. So let's try to give people something tactical they can do to create more space for alpha and gamma waves. And essentially your advice is, a fourth of your time should be spent, if possible, in alpha and gamma time. Is that right?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:01:22):\nYeah, I think that probably is overabundance, in all honesty. But if you think about it through the lens of a quarter, if you're going to be on a set of cadences, and this is probably the tactical advice. It's like, look at your cadences and say, at the quarter level, that's probably the right level of fidelity for most people to look at their calendars in terms of what big stuff should we be doing? Because six months is usually too long to do anything big. Too much has happened in the world. Year is definitely too long to wait for a cadence to kind of kick in. So quarterly is really good. And what's nice is when we cluster our gamma time on this quarterly cadence, we can take a lot of the stuff that would be what we call calendar invaders, these random conversations that come up out of nowhere. And we can be like, \"Well, we're getting ready to have an offsite, this quarter's offsite in two weeks. Can this idea wait until then to be processed?\"\n\n(02:02:16):\nSo you kind of get this nice little black hole effect, where a lot of distractions have a new home, because you've actually said, \"We're going to distinctly do stuff.\" You're saying, \"Yes, but not now,\" to a lot of distractions. But yeah, I think that's the ideal cadence. And that, for some teams, it needs to be maybe a half a day or a full day. You'll figure it out based on your own business. But what per quarter is a necessary amount of time for us to break beta and go into deep thinking analysis mode? How healthy is our operation? How smart are we being? Are we delivering value? What needs to be reevaluated from the market's experience, the customer's experience, the team's experience? Let's look at these different views of the business, and make some prioritized decisions about, we're going to make specific improvements this quarter for these areas.\n\n(02:03:10):\nAnd then even once a week, maybe just find half a day if you can, maybe, but maybe less than half a day, couple hours to be in gamma, once a week. And you'll kind of feel it out from there. But the reason the rule of thumb of 25 is out there is 25 is kind of the risk point. Because most people will be like, \"We're not even spending 5%.\" Or the perfectionist team might be like, \"We're 50.\" So if you're far away from that rule of thumb, that's a pretty good indicator it's a good time to audit yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:03:42):\nWhen you hear the term, deep work, is that generally referring to gamma time?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:03:47):\nYeah, people can use that term in a couple of ways. I think a lot of people call deep work, don't bother me beta, which could be one. And other teams might call gamma deep work, but that's probably more appropriate. I think, don't bother me beta is for some teams, they need to be told, \"No, no, use this time not just to not be interrupted, but to think differently about problems. To think about is the architecture even right? Is the way we are thinking about this even right?\" Not just get a lot of stuff done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:04:18):\nYeah. So it's not just sitting in your email and write documents, it's actually try to think about bigger problems, things that are challenging your brain, not just like, \"I'm just productive getting stuff done, getting stuff done.\" Awesome. Something that worked really well for me, similar to what you just recommended is having, I had two blocks of time during the week that were two hours or three hours long, where it's just, \"Don't bother me, deep work time.\" So I had it I think Wednesday morning and Friday morning for two or three hours. And actually in the calendars, if you book something during this time, I'll slap you. And that worked really well. And nobody complained.\n\n(02:04:54):\nWe covered a lot. Here's the things we've covered. I was just taking notes and all the advice that you've shared, how to help people run better meetings, how to get better at developing vision for their team, and company, and product, how to be a better influencer. How to build better relationships, how to create a better culture for your company, how to create more focus and more productive focus. That's a lot. I'm very proud of our conversation. Before we get to a very short lightning round, because we've gone pretty long, I want to keep it short.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:22):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:05:22):\nIs there anything else you want to share, leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we close-\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:05:28):\nNo, I don't think we need... I mean, there's certainly a lot more that we could talk about, but I think we don't want to melt any minds. So we want people to kind of walk away and be like, \"I can do that, I can do that, I can do that.\" So definitely pick two or three wins. I kind of call them pots of ocean to boil instead of oceans to boil. So get a few pots of ocean to boil first, and focus on that for sure. And definitely make one of those pots, if it's a problem area for you, what kind of experience you are. I mean, that's central to everything. Everything else works better in the whole system once you've boiled that pot of the ocean, and then things get easier.\n\n(02:06:05):\nAnd then I guess the only last thing I would add is, think of everything we've talked today. It might help to put some language to it as floor risers and ceiling risers. Because your company has a horizon of performance that you're heading into, and there's a bottom end of that range and a top end of that range. So as you get better at meetings, not only are you increasing... You're raising the floor to get rid of bad meetings and waste, and you might be saving a ton of time or converting useless time into useful time, but you also might be raising the ceiling.\n\n(02:06:35):\nAnd I would be really specific with yourself and your team about, which outcome are you chasing? Is it both? Is it one or the other? And say, we're actually trying to raise the floor so that our performance never goes below a certain range. We get faster, smarter as a result, fewer mistakes. Or are we actually trying to uncap a ceiling that we're dealing with right now, especially around things like strategy and vision? If we feel that those conversations always end up feeling like inconceivable arguments, we have a ceiling on our business's performance. As a result of that, can we raise that ceiling and explore a higher horizon of performance for the business?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:12):\nAmazing. Evan, with that, we've reached our very exciting and very quick lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:18):\nYes, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:07:20):\nAll right, so let's start with what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:07:26):\nWell, the obvious first one is Never Split the Difference. I recommend that book to everybody in the universe. I think if you haven't read it yet, you shouldn't get your driver's license. For those who don't know, it was written by Chris Voss, he was an FBI hostage negotiator. And it explores how to negotiate with people, and not just hostages, but your colleagues, your parents, your wife, like everybody. And there's some very surprising technique in there that is unexpected, not trying to get people to agree with you, but getting them to say no, more often. Instead of saying, \"Hey, Lenny, are you willing to do this?\" Say, \"Hey, Lenny, are you opposed to doing this?\" And it's just this reversal. And \"I'm giving you the out,\" is the way he explains it. There's a whole bunch of other technique, but the more of that technique is in a team, the better. The better the team does. That's a no-brainer.\n\n(02:08:16):\nThe second one I would say, since we've kind of covered this topic a little bit about habitat today. If you enjoy reading books that are sort of root canals, but you're better off because you read them, there's a book called Never... not Never Split the Difference, there's a book called The Person and the Situation. It was written by some researchers, some psychological researchers. And what it explores is the difference between how personality influences your behavior, and how the situation you're in, or like we talked about, the habitat you're in, influences your behavior. And if you're not yet convinced that either of those matters, like, \"Oh, it doesn't. I'll do what I do regardless of the habitat, or I'll do what I do regardless of who I am,\" that book will melt the face off of that existing mental model conclusively. It's really valuable knowledge to understand the mechanics of how the situation influences a person, and how the personality influences the person.\n\n(02:09:12):\nAnd then I guess the last, maybe we'll put a fork in the road of a choose your own adventure. If you're a real student of the game, and you want go 10,000 leagues under the sea on this stuff, there's a series of books called the Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience. You can find it on Amazon. A lot of them, you can just get on your Kindle for a lot cheaper than the library-decorating version of it, but that is bonkers. It talks about how your brain applies to intelligence, emotionality, relationships. It's incredible knowledge. If you instead want to keep it more in the part of the world you experience and can see and not the brain. Thaler wrote a book called Misbehaving. It was kind of the major book about behavioral economics.\n\n(02:09:58):\nAnd again, we spend a lot of time in companies talking about the way people should act, instead of the way people do act. And behavioral economics is essentially the version of economics that's about how people do act, not how people should act. So I think that's a great field of study. And then again, Robert Greene's whole library is super valuable, especially Human Nature, if you're into that. He's a little darker of an author, certainly kind of doesn't pull punches about human nature. So those are all great books to explore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:10:28):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:10:31):\nI look more at the category level of products. I really like products that have great ergonomics. A lot of people underestimate the value of what it feels like to use the product. Are things in the right place at the right time? I just started this newsletter that's kind of like, how do you break all of what we do in a bite-sized pieces for people who are super interested in this stuff to get something weekly? And it exposed me to Beehiiv, which is a very well-designed newsletter platform, high ergonomics. I don't ever find anything hard to find. I can get things to work the way I want them to work.\n\n(02:11:07):\nSo just, I like that example. And I remember even back to when I was obsessed with finding the perfect backpack to travel with, and then you find these brands where you're going through security, and you didn't even know it, but there's a pocket designed for your phone in exactly the place you would want the pocket for your phone to be. And you're just like, \"That's so great. I love that this team designed this pocket just in the right spot.\" So that's really my focus is ergonomics in product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:11:32):\nFinal question. I saw you tweeted that people are telling you that you look like JD Vance, which is hilarious. Do you think this will be a net benefit or a net hurdle?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:11:42):\nIt'll be an incredible benefit to Halloween, because it's totally clear what I'm going to do for Halloween. Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to see what people in the street... Fortunately I live in Park City, so I don't run across a lot of people in the street who want to yell at people. But if I lived in Chicago or something like that, I would've no doubt somebody would come up and throw something at me. But yeah, I'm neutral on the topic so far, minus the Halloween bonus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:12:09):\nWe'll see. We'll see how your life changes. Evan, this has been amazing. There's so much richness to this conversation. And like I said, we've covered basically everything people want to get better at as product manager, you could say. Two final questions. Where can folks find the stuff that you do to dig deeper, to learn more, to learn more deeply from you? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:12:31):\nYeah, I mean, they can certainly find a lot of the stuff we do on our website, core-sciences.com. Find a link to that profile you talked about on there, which can be super fun to take and insightful. The newsletter, all the stuff that we do, you can kind of find out there. And then certainly Twitter. I mean, I've always been really prickly about people that get on Twitter to post only and not to interact. I'm kind of the opposite. I really love people's questions and pushback. And just yesterday, I probably spent way longer than I should have out of my portfolio management approach to time, just on a thread where I was talking to this really interesting woman about this debate almost, about the probability of people doing things based on their beliefs, which was... And then we had some kind of bystanders watching the whole thing happen, and I had a meeting with a good friend Rod afterwards, where we talked about how that all went.\n\n(02:13:28):\nSo I love to talk to people and answer questions, and I'm sure people will have plenty of questions that they'd love to dive deeper into. So I'm on Twitter for sure. And then how you can help me. I mean, fortunately for me, I'm in the business of helping other people, whether those are individuals, teams, companies. So the most helpful thing to me is you helping yourself. So if you find our content valuable, if you want to have awesome managers or anything like that in this sort of science-based, kind of more efficient approach to getting there would be interesting, then reach out. We don't bite. We're pretty easy to work with. And that would be super fun to have a conversation about what your team needs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:08):\nEvan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEvan LaPointe (02:14:10):\nThanks for having me. This has been really cool. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:14:12):\nSame for me. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "这些内容，比如你过去和其他一些人聊过的，你的那些对话，Canva 的对话、Figma 的对话都让我印象深刻，因为能非常明显地感受到他们为了营造一个能让人高效运作的环境所投入的精力。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):\n你是指我和 Figma 和 Canva 的人的采访吧。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:13):\n完全正确。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\n我明白了。能再展开说说吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:19:17):\n想想 Canva 的例子，他们用教练而不是管理者。我很喜欢这个，让我先退一步说。有一句很棒的话，我觉得 Dan Pink 对这个问题的总结比任何人都好，他说：\"科学所知和商业所为之间存在错配。\" 在这个差距中，\"商业正在做的哪些事情是科学已经知道有更好方法的？\" 你几乎可以把这看作一个等式：科学所知 减去 你的商业所为 等于 功能失调。这是一个非常清晰的概念。如果你看管理者对比教练这个例子，我认为他们是凭直觉做的。我不知道他们是不是神经科学家，但我认为很多伟大的创始人凭直觉理解人类不会以某种特定方式工作，而这整个管理者范式似乎经常失败。整个\"快速失败\"的口号似乎也经常失败，使命宣言似乎也经常失败。\n\n(00:20:22):\n你可以把\"科学所知商业所为\"作为一个透镜来审视自己，那些经常失败的东西值得关注。当你审视，好的，我们真的需要管理者吗，因为这似乎经常失败？还是有一个对人类更有效的范式，能激发更多人类潜能，并且切中要害？如果你计算 Canva 的数学题，科学所知对比 Canva 所为，无论他们是否知道自己在科学地做事，这个等式等于零。在这种情况下，科学所知和商业所为之间没有差异。还有 Figma 的对话，我很喜欢那次对话中的一句话，想象力是一个假设生成引擎，我记得是这么说的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):\n哦，Dylan 那次。是的，和 Dylan 的聊天。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:21:14):\n我很喜欢那个想法。因为当我们把想象力作为能力的一部分来讨论时，我们说的是想象力为你生成替代方案的能力，这就是它的目的。它不只是让你在无聊会议中在页边涂鸦。那是它的一部分，是一个附带好处。当你看想象力的目的时，如果你有很好的想象力，你在生活中总是有很多选择。米老鼠就是一个选择。它是一种通过会说话的老鼠传递信息的新替代方式。这很有趣。假设生成引擎的另一部分，我们非常关注的是，它不仅仅是生成选择和假设的能力，还包括把它们加载到你的 Oculus 头显中，然后在一个这个选择已经被执行的世界里四处走动的能力。这在某种意义上类似于愿景，你是否真的有能力把这棵想象之树的一个分支，这个假设加载到一个模拟中，然后探索在这个东西到位后世界会是什么样子？\n\n(00:22:23):\n如果你看 Canva 正在进行的这个教练的事情，而不是管理，你把它加载到模拟器中，你会想，\"天啊，这看起来很不错。这是一个高绩效的东西。\" 用倡导代替监管，我们就有了成长。这种方法中固有的各个方面，如果你问一个神经科学家，这样会不会更好？他们会说，\"哦，当然会。会好得多。\" 因为它激活了大脑中的这个部分，它减少了皮质醇，它做了所有这些科学知道会更有效的事情。有一整套从非常深层到非常战术性的事情我们可以做得不同，从而减少你所做的和科学所知之间的差距，随着你做这些事情，功能失调就会不断缩小。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):\n根据大脑的运作方式，你有没有发现人们可以在工作方式上做出哪些改变，无论是更好地开会，还是更好地施加影响？有哪些事情人们可以在本周尝试，从而在工作中或与同事合作时更成功？\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:23:32):\n在科学所知和商业所为的清单中，所有东西都在里面。文化在里面，会议在里面，目标在里面，截止日期在里面，团队动态，所有这些东西都在里面。我们可能只从那个很长的清单中挑几件事。会议是个好例子。我忘了具体统计数据是什么，但有一个疯狂的数字，不，不是12位数，是9位数，不，是12位数，数千亿美元的浪费被困在会议中。我们在浪费时间和会议上花费了天文数字的钱。对我们来说，比如在我们的项目中，平均差异在10%到20%之间。仅仅通过清理他们使用会议的方式，人们每周就能节省半天到一整天的工作时间。其中一部分只是会议的设计，比如把会议当作产品来对待，把它们当作应该有组织和有意图地使用的工作流，但很多是在会议内部，比如战术是什么？\n\n(00:24:38):\n这里有一些非常战术性的东西，一般来说，如果你从会议的阶段透镜来看，会议是启动和决策的结合。很多会议完全跳过了启动步骤。他们直接进入决策。如果我们在开始会议时假设这里的每个人都在同一页面上，有相同的信息，并且总体上有相同的预期结果，那么跳过启动步骤是安全的。我认为这对大多数会议来说是一个荒谬的假设，然而大多数人实际上会震惊地发现我们不在同一页面上，尽管我们从来就没有在同一页面上，只要你们一起工作超过两天。我们不做启动是一件疯狂的事情，而启动可以很简单。它甚至可以在邀请中完成。Outlook 和 Google 的一个疯狂之处是，你可以在 Outlook 中创建一个非常糟糕、毫无用处的会议，它永远不会看着它说，这可能没用。\n\n(00:25:46):\n就像你可以在 Trello 中输入公司历史上最愚蠢的项目，它会接受你输入的任何东西，而不会对其价值进行任何判断。现在，想象一下我们暂时必须自己做这个，直到有更好的日历出现，但想象一下如果 Outlook 或 Google Calendar 或 Cron（现在是 Notion 的一部分）会说，\"等等等等。这个会议的目的是什么？\" 你可以说，\"好的，是这样的。这个会议是关于生成选项或创造性问题解决或非常战术性的问题解决或寻求效率，或者我们即将进行的对话属于什么类别？应该应用哪些基本原则？我们是在尊重神圣的牛还是在这次会议中吃掉神圣的牛？心态是什么，启动是什么？我们如何能说这是适用于会议的心态和最终目的？\"\n\n(00:26:52):\n你可以写下来，可以在三分钟内读完。这不是什么艰苦的过程。Amazon 以艰苦的过程来做这件事，他们因此而闻名。这是智慧，知道我们需要启动。他们足够明智地意识到对它的需求。他们做了一个非常强大的执行。它不必那么强大。跳过启动是相当糟糕的。其他会议把启动和决策颠倒了。我们开始会议。你听说过钻石形思维，让我们用扩展性思维开始会议，用收敛结束会议的后半部分。但我们反而以收敛开始会议,意识到我们无法调和房间里各方的需求以达成收敛。\n\n(00:27:39):\n然后你可能会在会议中间听到，\"好吧，让我们重新开始，记住我们为什么都在这里。\" 我们在会议的后半部分做启动，正好赶上会议结束。这是人们可以做的一件非常明显的事情，但人们在启动时很少这样做。我很乐意生成一个清单，这样我们就不必讨论所有事情，但也许可以制作一些小的 PDF 或类似的东西，人们可以下载，上面写着，\"这就是优秀启动的样子。\" 然后当你进入决策时，这就是优秀决策的样子，这样你就可以有一个小指南，再次做你自己的数学题，科学所知我们在这次会议中做什么。我们跳过了一堆步骤,这增加了功能失调或事情出错的可能性，让我们缩小这个可能性而不是增加它。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):\n太棒了。如果你有那个就太好了。我们肯定会在节目注释中链接到它。这里的建议是，当你开始会议、主持会议时，确保让每个人都围绕我们试图解决的问题或我们试图从这次会议中得到什么、背景进行启动，而不是直接跳入决策。\n\nEvan LaPointe (00:28:44):\n非常值得注意的是，适用的原则。我认为这真的非常重要，不仅是我们来这里做什么，还有我们如何最好地思考这个问题。你甚至可以对原则进行辩论，对原则进行辩论比对根植于你原则严重错位的战术进行辩论要好得多。\n\n如果正在听这段内容的创始人，你还没有创建一个让快速影响变得容易的环境，也没有给予相应的许可，那么你实际上是在无意中拖慢公司的发展，只是因为你没有和团队把这件事说清楚。所以慢速影响就是那种\"让他们自己吃苦头学习\"的影响方式。他们正在走向悬崖，我们知道他们在走向悬崖。而很多时候我们会发现自己陷入了所谓的 Abilene 悖论。\n\n(01:08:39):\nAbilene 悖论是指房间里的每个人都知道这是个坏主意,但我们都说\"我同意\"。经典的 Abilene 悖论,如果你在 Google 上搜索相关梗图,就会看到比如爸爸觉得孩子们可能想去露营。妈妈不想去露营,孩子们也不想去露营。爸爸其实也不太想去露营,但每个人都想着\"爸爸可能想让我们去露营,那就去吧\"。然后他们都去了,结果都玩得不开心。我们经常看到这种情况上演。\n\n(01:09:09):\n很多人会说,\"我什么都做不了。在这种情况下我没有任何影响力。我们就让他失败,他会从中学习。\"或者像我这种不礼貌的人,在过去以错误的方式给反馈,我不会坐下来和 Evan 谈这个问题。他会通过失败自己领悟到这行不通。这可能需要几个月,可能需要几年,甚至可能需要一辈子的时间让人们以这种慢速方式学习。这也是一种影响形式。你是在有意识地说,我认为这个世界会制造足够多的失败,从而促使适应发生。这是一种影响形式,只是最慢的一种。\n\n(01:09:48):\n很多正在听的人可能会意识到,\"哦,这就是我在做的事。我怎样才能比仅仅让事情失败快得多?\"这就是中速影响发挥作用的地方。关于中速影响,有一本很好的书叫《挑战式销售》(The Challenger Sale)。在《挑战式销售》中,我们看到的概念是教人们一些东西。然后当他们带着这些新知识生活时,他们会看到之前没有看到的东西。比如,在我们可以反复使用的反馈例子中,\"嘿 Evan,你可能想注意一下当你说这些话时人们的肢体语言,这里有一些迹象需要留意,当你这样做并得到这种反应时,这可能表明人们认同并还在跟着你。而当你看到这种情况时,这可能表明人们在抵触。\"\n\n(01:10:37):\n在那个时刻你可以问这个问题,你可能会听到这样的答案。所以你就像是给了某人一个工具,让他们在未来慢慢理解。《挑战式销售》假设销售周期足够长,你不会在会议中就达成交易,你不是试图当场成交。你会教他们一些东西,然后说,\"嘿,如果你看到这些情况,这是一个相当明确的信号,表明你需要采取行动。那我们30天后再联系吧。\"30天后打电话,\"嘿,你有没有看到这些?\"他们会说,\"我到处都能看到,现在想看不到都难。\"\n\n(01:11:13):\n这就是你如何在几天、几周,最坏的情况下几个月内影响一个人,比让他们失败要快得多。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):\n实际上,我不知道你是否知道,我们邀请过那本书的作者来播客,Matt Dixon,我想是这个名字。《挑战式销售》的理念是挑战他们对市场实际情况和他们需求的看法和观点。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:11:36):\n没错。是的,我认为确实有挑战的成分,但我觉得这个方法中被低估的部分是,你仍然在让那个人观察世界,但你给了他们新的信息,这些信息正在打破他们大脑中的某种僵化挑战。魔法不是在挑战的那一刻全部发生的。之后会有一些时刻,继续在他们脑海中的这个预期或决策上施加那种钙、石灰和锈蚀溶解剂,直到有时他们会转过身来说,\"谢谢你告诉我这些。\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):\n所以这里的建议是,如果你想影响某人,试着弄清楚他们不知道什么。找到你知道但他们可能不知道的信息,因为一旦他们知道了,他们可能会说,\"哦,我完全明白你的意思了。\"\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:12:33):\n是的,完全正确。让他们知道并让他们带着这个信息生活一段时间。不要强行塞给他们让他们接受。如果他们带着这个信息生活哪怕只是一点点时间,甚至只是几天,这可能就足以回到一个柔和得多的对话中。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):\n这是否与你之前说的有关,我很喜欢这个想法——选择一个角色,根据你的性格选择你的影响风格,无论是幕后运作,这让我想到一个非常具体的人。他实际上要来播客,他是个绝地武士,能让人们达成一致,但非常幕后,非常注重会前会。这是一种角色,或者是讲一个引人入胜的故事,可能是通过演示文稿。我猜还有其他角色。这个分享信息的想法,是一种角色类型,还是每个人都应该做的事情,因为这是一个非常有效的策略?\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:13:27):\n我喜欢在几乎所有事情上都保持有意识的想法。我们是让信风把我们吹向某些事情,还是我们真的在做选择?我认为对你的风格有意识,这种角色的概念,是一个明智的步骤,这样你在经历这个过程时可以有一些护栏和一致性。它帮助其他人理解你在影响中扮演的角色。如果你始终如一地从同一个地方出发,你就是那种风格,就像我想通过这种方式影响这个组织,你会一次又一次地看到我这样做。\n\n(01:14:07):\n你给了自己一点许可,也可以从人们那里获得一些认同。如果你确实想采用更像野蛮人的方法,你可以说,\"嘿,我是那种唱反调的人,或者我是那种打碎它看看我用大锤狠狠砸它之后它是否还能站得住的人。\"我可以一次又一次地这样做吗?现在你已经为未来的自己争取到了以某种方式处理事情的许可,这会产生显著不同的影响结果,真的非常不同。我能够做到这一点,它加速了某些事情。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\n所以我听到的是,有很多方法可以得到你想要的,想想你的性格风格,找到最符合你运作方式的路径。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:14:52):\n没错。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):\n无论是幕后,还是引人入胜的故事。太棒了。所以这个角色基本上就是弄清楚你的...这有点回到了发挥你的优势,你擅长什么?用那个渠道来说服人们相信你想让他们相信的事情。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:08):\n是的,完全正确。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):\n我想到的是有哪些方式,当我打开游戏选择时有哪些角色选项?你提到了几个,但只是为了给人们一个概念,比如,哦,好的,我看到我可以尝试这种方式。你能分享一个小列表吗,就像这里有一些你可以尝试影响的方式。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:15:27):\n对人们来说,可能维度是最有价值的。我会说其中一个维度是同理心,也就是我是否想通过试图帮助人们、确保我们做对并让人们获得价值来施加影响。然后我在那里寻求的许可是,我能否质疑为什么我们现在不考虑用户?为什么我们不关心他们获得的价值,并以这种方式挑战我们?\n\n(01:15:59):\n我认为有些角色是基于逻辑甚至信念的,也就是我想成为在对话中注入更多知识和因果关系的人,在对话中挑战因果关系,让我们思考得更深入,挑战我们的信念,打破我们带进会议的那些神圣不可侵犯的东西,这样我们走出会议时对事情的感觉会不同。\n\n(01:16:27):\n所以我认为有很多不同的非常有用的维度。一个可能是非常基于创造力的。如果你遵循大五人格格式,它们已经为你列出来了。热情,有趣的维度。我想通过人们对什么感到兴奋的角度来挑战我们。什么让人们感觉良好?这让人们感觉良好吗?我们能对产品或这个营销活动做些什么调整吗?\n\n(01:16:54):\n看看 Siki 刚刚用 Runway 做的事情。我真的非常喜欢那个人,他的角色有很多组成部分,显然他周围的角色也为真正的下一级别做出了贡献。他们肯定在使用这些同理心维度相互挑战,成为照顾者或保护者的角色。所以有很多不同的方式可以把这些维度转化为角色。\n\n(01:17:28):\n但我认为当你在产品中看到每个视角的价值时,我真的很喜欢产品。如果你有功能性失调的高同理心、功能性失调的高开放性,你就有内在的奖励和动机去探索其他思维不那么直观探索的产品领域。你不需要拥有全部特质就能在产品方面很出色。但如果你天生就超级倾向于逆向工程,你就有一些不公平的优势。\n\n所以，如果你能充分信任别人，你的大脑在评估把这个任务交给别人、甚至把这些知识交给别人的风险时，相信他们会像你一样对待这件事，这就是你在一段关系中能感受到的一种显著更高的正向信任。\n\n(01:28:26):\n最后，信任第三层是当我们的大脑真正触及那些临界点时，我们会说在这个话题上，你的思维方式已经超越了我的思维方式。所以在烧烤聚会上的经典例子就是，如果 Wolfgang Puck 是邻居，我们会让 Wolfgang Puck 负责所有最关键的事情，甚至可能还包括布置音乐和装饰什么的。或者另一个例子，就像 Steven Spielberg 让 John Williams 为电影配乐时，他不是希望 John 做得和 Steven 一样好。他说的是：\"把账单发给我就行，尽量不要太疯狂。\" 但他不会坐下来拿着发票说：\"为什么你需要13个号角而不是11个?\" John 可以做 John 该做的事，因为在这种超越我的认知边界的风险上，存在着巨大的信任。让我来做会比让他或她来做风险更大，对吧?\n\n(01:29:25):\n所以这就是那个层级，但这对人类更重要，因为一旦安全系统被激活，你的价值就完了。所以如果你是一个很厉害的工程师，但你伤害了别人，那你是不是很厉害的工程师就不重要了，因为在社交网络中，在你组织的网状结构中，你是一个被保护层包裹的节点。信息不会像正常情况那样流向你，授权不会流向你，访问权限也不会像正常情况那样流向你。所以此时此刻，你是网状结构中一个被保护、被停用、被隔离的节点。很多人真的不明白这一点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\n是的，这是一个很好的可视化方式。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:30:16):\n然后是出人意料的结局。你每段关系的最后一个要素是吸引力。吸引力是你的大脑如何解读你与他人的共同经历。你是否期待和那个人在一起，你是否喜欢他们的风格，共同经历的真实感受。如果你想想，让我们最后一次拿 Shreyas 举例。他的能力和实用性如何？爆表。他有多值得信任？信任第三层，爆表。他会伤害别人吗？我是说，据我所知不会。他可能有一些我们不知道的黑暗过去，但就我所见，他的身后没有留下太多伤害。第三，和他相处是什么样的体验？他是一种极其正面的体验。所以他自然而然地积累了一段又一段又一段的优质关系。\n\n(01:31:15):\n同样，如果你是那个能力超强的工程师，现在让我们翻转中间的维度。我们也很信任你，但你是一个糟糕的体验。你会来我们的外出活动吗？你会参加这个会议吗？不，你不会来。我们不想让你在那里。你就像一场飓风。所以从生物学角度来说，当我们把这个转移到商业环境中时，我们编程中最大的 bug 是：在商业中最有意义的是，如果这是一个精英制度，拥有最好知识、我们能信任的最好的人应该在房间里，但如果他们是糟糕的体验，我们会用全身的力量来抵抗这一点。这真是令人沮丧。有趣的是，你可以把它翻转过来。我们都有朋友，或者认识有朋友的人，你无法信任他们，他们也没有什么值得一提的能力，但他们是超棒的体验。多好的朋友啊。\n\n(01:32:16):\n那么为什么我们会把这件事完全翻转过来呢？我认为这就是问题所在。当你解析那个清单时，当任何听众解析那个清单时，关键是要问：我是什么样的体验？这才是起点。不是我的工作做得有多好？我知道多少？我对这个流程有多关键？而是我是不是一个糟糕的体验？如果答案是肯定的，先不要太担心其他方面，你得先解决这个问题。\n\n(01:32:48):\n关于这个性格档案，当你解析这个档案时，你会发现一些事情，比如显然不是愉快的体验，像非常不礼貌，显然不是愉快的体验，过度霸道和强势，显然不是愉快的体验，在开放性上极低并表现出来，总是告诉每人他们把事情搞得太复杂了。对于那些真正出于善意想把事情做好的人来说，这不是一个很好的体验。所以在这些知识的指导下，你可以做一些具体的事情。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):\n最后这一点让我想到，为什么一些最有效的 PM 是那些为团队带来很多能量和积极性、让人们兴奋起来的 PM，这是一种非常软的技能，但你能为团队做的事情却非常强大，因为人们会指望你来领导他们。我曾与一位 PM 合作，在每次会议上，他都会说：\"这会很棒的。\" 他每次会议都这样进来，\"哦，谁准备好做决定了\"，这真的改变了一切。所以这是很棒的建议。\n\n(01:33:46):\n所以基本上，如果你想要更好的关系，这会让你成为更好的影响者，从\"我是什么样的体验\"开始，当人们与我合作、向我要东西、问我问题时，你分享了很多你可以做的具体事情。\n\n(01:34:03):\n我总是告诉人们的一件事是：试着微笑，看起来开心点。这会带来很大的不同。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:07):\n看起来开心点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):\n带来能量，看起来开心。试着兴奋起来。是的，所以如果你想建立更好的关系，这会有所有这些惊人的连锁效应，你的建议是思考当别人与你合作时，你给他们的体验是什么，建立信任，理想情况下达到第三层级，也就是你做得比他们更好。但这对所有事情来说都是一个高标准。然后最后一件事是，你真的很厉害吗？提升你的能力，这是最后一块。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:34:38):\n是的，没错。这并不是说因为其他要素是入口，这些就变得不重要了。我的意思是你的关系需要这三者，尤其是你的职业关系。所以是的，更多的是，如果体验是唯一在拖累你的东西，而你在其他方面非常值得信任、非常熟练和有能力，那就太可惜了。直接修复它。\n\n(01:35:03):\n有很多方法可以做到这一点。但我喜欢让人们创造性地探索这个问题。比如\"哦天哪，好吧，我可以把这个改成这个再改成这个。\" 关于信任这件事，你伤害人吗？我是说，就是这样。人们有理由相信你是有风险的或危险的吗？不幸的是，在很多环境中，环境本身要么允许、甚至奖励那些超级不值得信任的人在系统之前玩弄系统。正如你和 Jeffrey 谈论权力话题时，环境越糟糕，他的建议就越有效。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\n我能理解。\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:35:49):\n他是对的，他用了这样一句话：\"这就是世界一直以来的样子，现在的样子，以及将来永远的样子。\" 嗯，这是正常的功能失调的世界一直以来、现在以及将来的样子。如果你想让你组织中的人凭借优点晋升，让影响力发挥作用以产生更好的决策、制造更好的产品、拥有更好的公司、更快地前进等等，你需要创造一个环境，在这个环境中，Jeffrey 观察到的关于正常功能失调世界的东西在你的环境中基本上不起作用。所以，如果在你的环境中人们互相伤害是有效的，那么你的表现水平会远低于互相伤害极其无效的情况。这取决于你作为领导者、作为管理者等等。当然，技能就是技能。它是你将意图转化为结果的能力。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\n我很高兴你在谈论环境，这正是我想去的地方。所以我想把我们的时间花在另外两件事上，环境和专注，如何为专注创造更多空间并获得更好的专注。你已经多次提到这个想法，环境的理念。我认为另一种思考方式是你公司的文化。对吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:06):\n没错。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):\n好的，很好。那么你能推荐一些东西，让人们创造一个有利于好事发生的环境吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:37:15):\n让我们从头开始。在科学知道什么和商业做什么之间的差异中，让我们关注这样一个事实：大多数公司处理文化的方式有着非常不稳定的记录。就像如果使命、愿景、价值观是一家航空公司，你不会让任何家庭成员乘坐那家航空公司。它无法到达大多数预期的目的地。这是一个超级重要的起点，因为我在这里要打破一个神圣的牛。我不想让任何人觉得我试图刻薄或什么。只是值得看看那些不起作用的东西，并想知道是否有可能做得更好的东西。所以如果我们看环境和文化，它真的是关于人们相信什么。它是人们相信什么是可接受的、允许的、有成效的，而人们处理文化的方法中最大的缺陷。有趣的是，即使在 YC，他们也谈论这个使命、愿景、价值观、文化，这些东西是后来才有的，让业务先发生一些事情，这些后来再说。如果那是你要使用的范式，他们说得对，因为无论哪种方式它都不会起作用。\n\n所以你不如晚点再做。\n\n(01:38:31):\n但如果你要用正确的方式来做，去研究人类的信念体系，我们之前谈到了启动效应（priming），文化其实就是整个企业的宏观启动效应，关于你核心信念体系是什么，以及从这些信念体系中形成的行为准则。所以如果你在这方面做得很好，你应该从一开始就做好。我们应该以什么方式来运营这家公司、构建产品、共同协作等等？从第一天就把这个做对会非常非常有帮助。关于人们的信念体系，改变人们信念有两种方法。\n\n(01:39:10):\n使命、愿景、价值观，我们称之为表演式方法。意思是我要想出一些鼓舞人心的使命、价值观和愿景的表达方式，并且要表演得足够好。就像我们在公园里街头表演一样，这个使命、愿景、价值观要足够酷，让人们往我的吉他盒里扔点零钱，让他们买账，让他们聚集过来。我认为这完全是错误的方法，因为我们在希望能激励人们。我们在希望自己有足够的艺术天赋来做到这一点。另一种方法是演绎推理，逻辑演绎推理，从核心出发。希望市场上有人因为我们公司的存在而高兴，谁会因为我们的存在而高兴，他们为什么会因为我们的存在而高兴？这就把我们的使命转变成我们所说的你的角色，你在周围世界中扮演的角色。\n\n(01:40:08):\n谁会因为你的存在而高兴？他们为什么会因为你的存在而高兴？这是一个事实。这不是一个鼓舞人心的想法。这就像，好的，我们跟一家做基于AI的光学字符识别、文档采集等业务的公司合作。世界为什么会因为他们的存在而高兴？因为我们能把95%的文档扫描成结构化数据，而这些通常需要人工手动录入。这相当有说服力。世界为什么会因为Warby Parker的存在而高兴？因为以前你必须在看起来傻但便宜和看起来酷但贵之间做选择，现在你可以既看起来酷又便宜。世界真的很高兴我们存在。\n\n(01:40:50):\n这是真实的。我不需要你被激励去相信这是真的。现在我们要思考的所有其他信念，我们都将从这个基础上推导出来。所以我们要用逻辑来构建我们的文化，而不是用激励。接下来我们需要弄清楚的是，当我们在世界上扮演这个角色时，创造的具体价值是什么？我们为人们省钱、省时间、开拓市场、帮助人们探索他们原本无法触及的可能性和潜力等等。\n\n(01:41:21):\n那么Core的角色是什么？人们因为我们的存在而高兴，是因为我们帮他们挖掘了之前无法接触到的潜力。在团队层面、公司层面，这可能是一件非常重要的事情。所以我们知道这一点，然后说：\"好吧，天哪，这意味着太多东西了。\"我们现在要做很多事情，这会产生什么价值？然后我可以说，好的，一旦我们理解了价值的定义——它来源于我们的角色——现在我们就可以改变\"完成\"的定义。很多团队谈论行动偏向（bias to action）。仓鼠也有行动偏向。它们从稻草堆里爬起来，拼命转那个轮子，但完全哪儿也去不了。但如果你理解你在世界上扮演的角色——\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:42:01):\n但如果你理解你在世界上扮演的角色，理解你在节省时间、降低成本、创造增长等方面产生的价值，无论你做什么，那么你就可以说：\"我们应该有影响力偏向（bias to impact），而不是行动偏向。我们不应该只是做事情，我们应该产生能带来价值创造的结果。我们应该为人们节省时间。\"现在当你是一个产品团队，看着这个，你会说：\"嗯，Lenny，这有个很酷的新想法，我们来做这个吧。\"你现在可以用这个作为基本准则来问：\"哦，这如何为人们产生价值？这如何让人们更快、节省时间、变得更聪明、做一些他们原本做不到的事情？\"然后当你去向他们销售时，你还可以用完全相同的词汇：\"这就是它如何让你更快、更聪明、更高效、节省成本。\"\n\n(01:42:50):\n所以这是真正的逻辑演绎。如果人们认为我们应该做某件不创造价值的事情，现在我们不需要用激励的方式，而可以用逻辑的方式。我们不构建不产生价值的东西，这不是优先事项，除非我们能把它变成确实产生价值的东西。所以你把文化变成了非常实用的东西，从表演式文化转向逻辑演绎式文化。我认为这对大多数人来说真的非常关键，就是说：\"让我们理解为什么世界会因为我们的存在而高兴。\"这就是为什么我们有团队，这就是为什么我们有客户。这对我们在执行和价值创造时的标准意味着什么？甚至细化到邮件层面。如果我给某人的问题发了一个草率的邮件回复，没有为他们产生价值，那我就还没完成。我需要完成工作，直到它为他们产生价值。\n\n(01:43:43):\n质量标准也被嵌入其中，这同样是隐含的。如果Warby Parker给我发了一个质量只有2分（满分10分）的东西，我会因为他们的存在而高兴吗？不会。所以我们不能做2分的东西。每个人都有信念。可能有很多人面试Warby Parker时认为2分完全没问题，只要发给他们就行。但不，我们需要对这种信念的抗体。我们有决策智慧，每个人都相信我们应该快速行动、打破常规，或者我们应该超级慢、把一切都做对，或者介于两者之间。这是一个有趣的话题。最后，你有团队动态信念，本质上就是每个人关于什么是对待他人可接受方式的信念。这会让对方处于什么状态？\n\n(01:44:35):\n很多人，特别是像我这样低礼貌性的人，会花很多年认为：\"我在快速给出诚实的反馈。这很高效。\"但你会发现，\"当人们花六个月而不是六分钟来采纳你的反馈，因为他们就是不太喜欢你，而且你这个吸引力问题让你被排除在所有房间之外时，这怎么会高效呢？\"实际上，你的效用——你的礼貌是一种效用传递机制——但我们不想让你进房间。所以在这种情况下，你对业务没有益处。这就是起点。这是环境的基础：不要在激励的根基上构建环境。这行不通。它可能有用，对吧？如果你做了超级激励人心的事情，而且你是超级激励人心的人，那么你可能有艺术能力做到这一点。但即便如此，如果你通过逻辑演绎而不是激励来做，你仍然会做得更好。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):\n假设有人说：\"好的,我要改善我的环境，我要改善我的公司文化。或者我刚开始建立一个好的环境。\"他们能做什么？他们今天、这周可以做什么来开始做这件事？是坐下来思考我们提供的价值是什么？我们为什么存在？还有其他你会推荐的事情吗？\n\nEvan LaPointe (01:45:54):\n大脑渴望得到这个问题的答案：我为什么要做这个？不仅有我们应该开始做的事情，而且我喜欢通过把它想成我们应该开始做我们一直疏忽的事情，来加深人们对我们应该开始做的事情的承诺，对吧？不只是\"哦，这样会更好\"，而是我们实际上因为在某些事情上的疏忽而造成了一些环境问题。人们疏忽的首要事情是向他们的团队回答\"我为什么要做这个\"这个问题。说\"你应该做这个因为这是你的工作\"是一种疏忽，对吧？你实际上并没有以任何有用的方式回答这个问题。因为我也可以用安全的方式回答，我刚才就是这么做的，说\"这是你的工作\"。我在暗示有后果。但我也可以说，因为如果你不做，会发生这些具体的坏事。\n\n(01:46:52):\n你可以在奖励方面给他们一个理由，因为，哦，如果你做这个，你会得到这个，或者如果我们做这个，我们会得到这个。但你也可以给他们一个有目的性的答案，为什么，这不是一种疏忽，就是说，因为我们的工作真的很重要。有人在等着我们发布这个产品来改善他们的状况，他们也希望我们同时把它做对。所以通过这个视角来理解影响力偏向。我们确实需要发布这个。它需要实现，而且需要做对，或者至少在第一个版本中足够对。\n\n(01:47:28):\n所以如果你一直疏忽——我们都有过这样的时候，对吧？我不是要评判，但我在试图让人有所触动，对吧？建立一些触动，建立一些承诺。如果你一直疏忽于向所有和你一起工作的人回答我们为什么要做这个。这就是起点，确保每个人都知道为什么。而且这个\"为什么\"是整个团队共享的为什么。不只是Simon Sinek式的宏观的为什么。我是指非常具体的为什么。",
