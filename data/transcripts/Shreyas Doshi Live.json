This is Shreyas' second time on the podcast. His first visit is the third most popular episode of all time of this podcast, and I love that Shreyas was game to try this.\n\n(00:20):\nIn our conversation, Shreyas shares three questions plus a bonus question that he wished he'd asked himself sooner in his career. We talk about why product leaders are so busy, why the job is so frustrating, why it is so central to build good taste, and also why you're probably not listening as well as you should be. This was so much fun, a huge thank you to Shreyas for doing this.\n\n(00:41):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nShreyas Doshi (01:01):\nThanks, Lenny, for having me. This is amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04):\nI was going to ask, we recorded our first episode, I think two years ago, and I was in a tiny room in my house. I don't know where you were, but it was very not like this. Thoughts on the setup of this episode?\n\nShreyas Doshi (01:18):\nSo first, the Lenny Empire keeps growing, which is amazing to see. And second, as I was coming up here, somebody told me this used to be a car dealership, and I actually realized I purchased my car here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34):\nWhat?\n\nShreyas Doshi (01:36):\nSo crazy, only in SF.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38):\nWhat kind of car was this? Say more.\n\nShreyas Doshi (01:40):\nIt was a Honda CR-V.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42):\nOkay, wow. I am told this venue was also used for... Jimi Hendrix performed here, and Aretha Franklin performed here. So it's like Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Shreyas.\n\nShreyas Doshi (01:56):\nThere we go, that's going up on my Twitter bio soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:02):\nOkay, so usually, when we talk, you're full of ideas and you're full of answers. When we were preparing for this, you told me, \"I have questions, I have questions I want to ask.\"\n\nShreyas Doshi (02:16):\nYou know, reflecting on my career as a PM leader over the years, there are some questions I wish I had asked myself sooner, but I did not, and I had the great luck of having a life, a PM life full of suffering, and I have zero complaints about it. But as I look back, I feel like there are some questions that even if I asked myself some questions, those questions, I wasn't honest to myself about the answers. So that's what I thought I'd do, is share the questions that I wish I'd asked myself sooner.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (03:05):\nAwesome.\n\nShreyas Doshi (03:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (03:06):\nLove that, okay. This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like, Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.\n\n(03:41):\nWorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features, like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(04:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native, customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Are native integrations on your product roadmap? Whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today.\n\n(04:50):\nBut building these integrations in-house cost an average of three months of engineering, according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Coffee AI, AI21, and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon, so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their Pro and Enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.\n\n(05:37):\nWhat's the first question?\n\nShreyas Doshi (05:39):\nRight, so let's see, the first question is why am I so busy? Why am I so busy? And the background is that I have spent most of my career just being completely stressed out, just absolutely stressed out every day. And there were many reasons for it, but one of the core reasons was I was always super busy, and there was always work I felt like I couldn't do that I wanted to do, and so I would go home at the end of the day, and even if I had worked hard, I'd just feel dissatisfied.\n\n(06:27):\nAnd so that was a constant fixture of my life as a PM, PM leader, and it's only... So I did product work for about 20 years before I started this new chapter of my career. And I think I only fixed it in the last three or four years of my career as a PM leader. But that means that there were about 16 or 17 years where I was just incredibly busy, and because I was incredibly busy, I was extremely stressed, and even though I was doing a good job, I was not feeling very good inside. And then, that showed up in my body, like all sorts of pains and aches I realized were actually not physical pains and aches. They were pains and aches from the stress.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (07:15):\nIt's like health issues that you had?\n\nShreyas Doshi (07:16):\nYeah, yeah, minor stuff. I mean, relatively minor stuff, but playing tennis, and you pull your back muscle, and now you are horizontal for three days, doesn't feel good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (07:31):\nWho here is very, very busy, and is just way too busy? Raise your hand.\n\nShreyas Doshi (07:36):\nThat's it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (07:36):\nYeah, I know.\n\nShreyas Doshi (07:37):\nWhoa.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (07:39):\nEveryone's like [inaudible 00:07:39] everybody. Yeah, people were like, \"Yeah, yeah. I don't have to raise my hand, I'm busy.\" Yeah. Okay, keep going.\n\nShreyas Doshi (07:50):\nYeah, and so here's the thing, when we talk about being busy, and managing your time, energy, all of that, I mean, this is a group of senior product people, so you all know that. Take tips and techniques, like maintain a to-do list. I found the LNO framework very useful for me, which I've shared before. I used to like working out of a calendar, those types of things. And I think you're all familiar with those things, but what I wanted to call out is that, at some point in our product career, we reach something, we reach an immovable force that will just overwhelm us, no matter what we do.\n\n(08:39):\nAnd that force is a scope. Okay, so as we grow in our product career, our scope grows, and we kind of like that, which is all great, but at some point, if you haven't already gotten there, many of you have, but for those of you who haven't, you will get there, where your scope will be so large, that no matter what you do in terms of efficiency, whatever framework you use for prioritization, whatever framework or tool you use to manage your to-do list, whatever tools and techniques you use, whatever prioritization you do, your scope is so large that you are still going to be incredibly busy.\n\n(09:21):\nAnd so that's what I faced, like I was saying for the first about 16, 17 years of working on products, and only in the last 3 or 4 years was I able to kind of find some answers on how to deal with that scope. And so perhaps we can talk about that, what do you think?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:43):\nYeah, so you're basically saying there's all these productivity tricks, ways to do more faster. And no matter how many of these tools you've got, you are just going to take on more and more work, and they'll peter out? I'll say many of my most popular newsletters posts are, \"Here's productivity tricks and tips.\" And so people are always looking for these. And I'm curious to hear where you go with this, of just like that is not the answer long term, there's a different approach?\n\nShreyas Doshi (10:08):\nYes, and so the challenge is the following. How many of you are going through some kind of annual planning right now or you're planning on going through annual planning? Please. Everybody loves annual planning, great. So let's take annual planning. If you are a high-level manager, leader within a company, what does your month look like? Or in some cases, unfortunately, what do your two or three months look like when you are going through annual planning? It's all these kind of spreadsheets to fill out, and meetings to have, and dependencies, and priorities, and stakeholders to meet, and so on. And so I noticed, for instance, that at some point, that was making me really busy, and then that was making me feel guilty now, because I had my team to look after and to support, and then I had product decisions to make and various other things, and I've gone on some planning retreat or whatever.\n\n(11:15):\nAnd there you go, you last four, five, six, weeks, does that sound familiar to folks? Yeah? Okay, so I noticed that I needed to change that at some point, and actually found a solution, again, late in my career, but I found a solution, because I asked myself this question, which is, \"Why am I so busy? I'm doing all the efficiency things, I'm managing my to-do list like a champ. I have my calendar set up just right. I have my routine set up just right. I'm working out so that I'm engaged at work, I'm productive, I'm doing all of that. Why am I so busy? Oh, it's planning season, and that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.\" And this was at Stripe when I encountered this. So that is supposed to take up four to six weeks.\n\n(12:03):\nWell, I realized that you don't have to do that. And so at some point in my time at Stripe, what I realized is the following, we go through a whole all sorts of just rituals around planning for four to six weeks. Then, we emerge and we share our plan with our executives. You know the questions they're going to ask, like, \"If money were no concern, what would you do? What is your ambitious plan? So if we gave you five more engineers, what would you do? What other things would you include in the roadmap?\" Right? The standard stuff. And so you emerge, you do your presentation, and then you publish the plan, and then you start the new year with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement. And January goes fine, until you get three customer escalations for features that were not in your plan. And so now, you try to figure out how you're going to revise resources.\n\n(13:03):\nYou go talk to some dependency team that's going to sort of support these new features from these customer escalations. And you go through that process, and you revise your plan again. And then, usually by the time it's last week of February, everybody's forgotten the actual plan. And now, we are executing off of some other list somewhere. And by the way, when you mention this at times, politely of course, you might mention like, \"You know, I'm noticing we are not actually really using the plan that we spent four to six weeks minimum doing.\" And then, some smart person in the room chimes in with, \"Plans are useless, but planning is everything.\"\n\n(13:52):\nI don't know, Eisenhower, somebody else, I don't know who said this, \"Plans are useless, but planning is everything.\" Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what that means, but everybody appreciates, \"Ah, plans are useless, but planning is everything.\" Right? So I went through a few years of this. And then I go, \"You know what? I'm going to bend some rules here.\" And so what I realized, Lenny, is you don't have to go through these four to six weeks, and it was an accident. Basically, what happened is around that time, the product I was working on, Stripe Connect, it's like a major product for Stripe, major, major business for Stripe. And I had put together a product strategy, like a real product strategy for this product.\n\n(14:44):\nAnd so this must have been earlier in the year. And so now, planning season came along. And the interesting I found is that because I had a real product strategy, not one of those fake ones, a real product strategy that I had gotten alignment on with everybody, my planning for this major product for Stripe took me like three days. Right, so while a lot of my peers, unfortunately, for their own products, were in this four-to-six week cycle of planning, and meeting, and blah, blah, blah, I just put it all together in three days, and whatever artifacts were needed, I put them together.\n\n(15:27):\nI did not fill out some templates. That's where it's about bending the rules, because if a template doesn't make sense, why should I fill it out? There's no need to fill it out. And so that's when I realized that actually, if you have a real product strategy, a real one that everybody is aligned with, that you have got pre-alignment on, then a lot of this nonsense we tend to do with annual planning actually goes away. Now, you still have to do some resource allocation and all of that, but even there, you don't need that false precision. How many of you have gotten into arguments about, \"So should it be eight engineers for this team in 2025, or nine engineers for this team in 2025?\"\n\n(16:11):\nLike, who cares? We all know that even those numbers that we set up, we don't actually follow through on them, as 2025 happens. So that's just an example of where we spend a lot of time on things that we think are strategic, that we think are important, but actually, we ought to spend that time on other much higher leverage things. Right, now it does require some upfront work, in this case upfront work on a clear product strategy that everybody understands, that everybody's aligned on. But frankly, if you have that, planning should be a breeze.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:49):\nSo what would be your kind of tactical tip for folks that want to do this better? I know there's probably a billion examples of these sorts of things you shared, so planning is an example. Folks that want to be less busy, maybe on that one is it give yourself very little time, and focus on strategy, and let that be the plan, basically, versus every single person and their roadmap for the next six months. What's the piece of advice you'd share there? And then, I want to move on to the next question, because I want to make sure we get through all these questions.\n\nShreyas Doshi (17:18):\nYes, there's definitely a specific tip, which is if you do have a strategy that will make a lot of your prioritization problems go away, it will make a lot of planning problems go away. And even if you do have some escalation from sales, which you will, or from support, or somewhere else, you now have at least a more rigorous framework to figure out what to do with that escalation. So there's definitely that.\n\n(17:48):\nBut I think other thing I want to share is that, and this was my other realization as I asked the question, \"Why am I so busy?\" is I realized that I am so busy because I'm not making good product decisions. Okay, now, you have to understand, by this time I'm like 15 years into building products and whatever, 11 years into being a product manager. And so I think I'm pretty good. That's my kind of self-image. But then, again, if I'm being honest to myself, I'm not making as good product decisions as I can. So can I share an example of that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:32):\nPlease.\n\nShreyas Doshi (18:34):\nSo what I noticed is that you have a meeting about some product feature that somehow is requested or is really important, whatever the case might be. And so you have a meeting with some stakeholders and your engineering team, designers, et cetera. And then, you're trying to decide, \"Should we build this or not?\" And somebody says, \"You know what? Why are we doing a meeting for this?\" I read somewhere or I heard Bezos say that two-way doors, it's a two-way door. You quickly make a decision. Like, just quickly make a decision and move on. This is a two-way door. And so you say, \"Yeah, that's right.\" And any time we hear something like that, two-way door, you're like, \"Oh, that person's really smart, so I want to be like them.\"\n\n(19:32):\nSo I noticed that myself and my team, we were making these kinds of decisions without very clearly thinking through customer motivation, very clearly thinking through differentiation, very clearly thinking through a distribution approach for whatever this feature is. And while it sounds like, \"Oh, of course you should be doing this,\" I guarantee you this is not how most product teams work. They're talking about, \"Well, is Bob the engineer going to be free? And when are they free? And if they are free, then let's build the feature.\" That's kind of how a lot of product decisions happen.\n\n(20:11):\nThe challenge here with this kind of approach, and again, this is what happens in practice, I'm not talking about whatever theory you read, this is what happens in practice. So when you follow this approach and you assume that, \"Oh, this is a two-way door, we can kill the feature,\" in reality, it doesn't work out that way, because here's what happens in reality. So in reality, you commit to the feature, and it's going to take five, six weeks to do it, and then a couple more weeks to make sure, to ramp it up, et cetera, right? And so now the feature is out, and now you have your Q1 QBR, right? Say two months from now you have your Q1 QBR, and you're going to present your business review, whatever. You're going to present what you did, \"What did you do last quarter? How are your ships performing from last quarter?\"\n\n(21:03):\nAnd so now, it's time to talk about this feature at the QBR, because you have to share that/ Now as you start talking about this feature, the CEO will ask, \"So yeah, we launched the feature. I'm very glad we launched this feature. How is it doing?\" And you want to be able to say, you are the PM leader, you want to be able to say something smart, and something that makes you look competent. But the challenge is the feature hasn't had much adoption. So I'm not going to ask anybody to raise hands, but I think most PMs are familiar with this conundrum. And of course, we are verbally very agile as product leaders. So what we say is we don't have data, so we use favorable anecdotes.\n\n(21:53):\nAnd so we say, \"Yeah, we launched the feature, and you know what? This customer from this company really loves the feature.\" And we put in an anecdote, it's like, \"Life-changing feature.\" It doesn't matter that they're the only person using it. That doesn't matter. \"Life-changing feature,\" right? We use data when it favors us, we use anecdotes when it favors us. So anyway, so we present that. Now. we do have the sales counterpart in the room too, our sales counterpart, and they say, \"You know what, though? We are still not winning many deals because of this feature.\" And so of course the CEO asks, \"So what's up? Why aren't we winning deals, even though we have the feature?\"\n\n(22:30):\nSo the people on the customer side usually we respond, \"Well, I'm glad we have the feature, but it's not full featured yet. We need all these other bells and whistles to meet the table stakes.\" So now, what happens? Somebody uttered the word, \"Meet the table stakes.\" Now, it's over for you, because now, the only response you can give is, \"Oh, yeah, that's already part of the plan.\" And now, you put your engineering leader on the spot and you say, \"Alice, isn't it? Haven't we allocated engineers to it already?\" And so now, Alice has to come up with some response, which is like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carol and David are going to work on it. It's slotted for one of these sprints.\"\n\n(23:19):\nAnd so now, you exit the QBR, you high-five each other. Well, \"Good job, team, great job,\" et cetera, et cetera. But now, you have signed up for even more work for a feature you should not have built in the first place. That's why we're busy. And through a product leader's life, what happens is we just accumulate all of this debt, feature after feature. So I guess what I'm saying, Lenny, is one of my other tactical tips would be sometimes it is useful to pause for two minutes, or two days, or two weeks before making that decision, right? Because frankly, most doors that look like two-way doors are actually one-way doors. They are two-way doors at Bezos' level, but as a PM leader, for you, they are a one-way door, and that's making you busy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:18):\nWow. I feel like you're a stand-up comedian/product manager. That was incredible.\n\n(24:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Get $1,000 off Vanta when you go to vanta.com/lenny. That's vanta.com/lenny.\n\n(25:21):\nI know it's Spotify, I heard one of their core values is, \"Talk is cheap,\" but it's the virtue version of that. It's like, they actually prefer to talk more, and I think that's exactly what you're saying. Basically, spend more time on these things that seemingly seem just small little ideas and experiments.\n\nShreyas Doshi (25:37):\nYep, thinking is cheap, so you should do more thinking, not less.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:41):\nAmazing. Shreyas, what's your second question?\n\nShreyas Doshi (25:45):\nYes. So my second question, I have to get the words right, do I actually have good taste? Do I actually have good taste is my second question. And for me, I asked this question after, again, all of these things... By the way, everything I say, I have been that guy, I've made that mistake. So that's why I just have to admit to myself that, yes, I have made these mistakes. And one of the mistakes I made, this was when I was at Google, and I was relatively new to product, about less than five years. And at Google, there's some parts of Google where you would be told as an early career PM that like, \"We don't do strategy here. Strategy is for MBAs, okay? We are all about execution, okay?\"\n\n(26:47):\nSo I'm in this environment, I'm naïve, and I look around me and I'm like, \"Google is the most successful company on the planet,\" at the time, and they are saying this, and I'm hearing this consistently, so it must be right. It must be right. And so I start saying it. I start saying, \"Oh, yeah, execution is everything, and we don't do strategy around here.\" And I even remember there were not that many PMs, but there was a PM at Google who was kind of like the same level as me, but he just had much more wisdom than me. And he was trying to nudge me into... Like, I was managing a product. And he's like, \"Shreyas, what is your strategy here?\" And I was like, I told him the same thing. Like, \"Oh, no, no, what are you talking strategy? We don't need strategy. We just need to get shit done.\" That was the thing.\n\n(27:42):\nAnd so I kept repeating that mantra until I got to Twitter. So this is Twitter right after their IPO. And I saw Twitter had an incredible asset, which is the product and the network effects. It had other incredible assets, including the brand. It had other assets that were great, including the talent. And yet, this company was struggling, the product was struggling. And even if it wasn't struggling, it was making a lot of money. But the point is it was not meeting its potential. So that's when I realized, and it wasn't like some sudden realization, it took me six to nine months of being at Twitter. This is circa 2014. That's when I realized that, \"Oh, my gosh, Twitter's biggest problem is a product strategy problem. The reason they're struggling is they don't have a real product strategy.\"\n\n(28:38):\nNow, of course, attempts were made to create a product strategy, but it wasn't a real compelling, cohesive product strategy. So that's when I realized the folly of like, \"Oh, wait a minute...\" I was at Google six years. I spent most of those six years saying like, \"Ah, strategy's useless. There's no point to strategy. Execution is where it's at. \"I'm like, \"No, actually, I was wrong.\" And that got further solidified as I went to Stripe, and I was kind of now growing earlier stage products and trying to make them highly, highly successful. I saw an even greater value and importance of having a clear strategy. And so that made me realize, basically...\n\n(29:29):\nYou know, we talk about taste, we all talk about taste, and it's about the beautiful pixels, and the perfect product, and the whatever else, the Steve Jobs-esque passion, and all of that, whatever it is. And yes, taste is about that, but I think there is something that we as product leaders, and certainly I did, needed to recognize about taste as just a factor in pretty much everything we do, which is like, do we have good taste around the beliefs we choose to create within ourselves as product leaders? And then, those beliefs end up dictating everything we do, including how we manage, how we lead, how we make decisions. And so it's that taste I'm talking about when I say, \"Do I really have good taste?\"\n\n(30:28):\nAnd when I asked myself this question, and again, I really had to dig deep. It wasn't easy, but at some point I realized that no, actually, I don't have good taste. I don't have good taste in how I choose to evaluate things that come my way. Again, not in terms of the product, because by that time I had skills to say, \"Well, this should not be a two-step flow. This should be a three-step flow,\" whatever the case may be. But I still did not have good taste in terms of how I choose what are the things I choose to believe, how do I learn, who do I learn from, what content I learned from, what content I resonate with? And then, I went on this journey to try to develop that better taste.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (31:21):\nWhat I'm hearing is people focus maybe too much on the output, like the experience, these experience design taste versus what they choose to take in as informing their taste, and what they see as an example of great and correct. Is that what you're saying?\n\nShreyas Doshi (31:37):\nYeah. And look, taste is about the ability to identify what is really good, without needing to see its results, because, look, it requires zero taste right now for anybody to say, \"Oh, that CEO of NVIDIA is a genius, right? Jensen is a genius.\" If you are saying that in 2024, it actually requires zero taste, because you can just look up NVIDIA stock price. It requires zero skill. But to be able to say that in 2010, you have to realize Jensen Huang didn't change much between 2010 and 2024. So Lenny, even in sports, there's this saying, \"Game recognize game,\" and that's about taste.\n\n(32:59):\nBut what we need to understand is it's game recognize game before the game is called, right? Like, game recognize game in the practice session. Because it takes no genius right now to say, \"Well, Patrick Mahomes is great quarterback,\" or, \"Virat Kohli is a great cricketer,\" or whatever else. It requires no genius to do that. It requires zero taste. So I also believe some of us, especially as we get more senior, and we get more successful, and we just get a lot more scope, and responsibility, and a lot of accolades, we become these tough graders. Like, \"I don't like anything,\" right? Like, \"Ah, this is crap, this is crap, this is crap.\" Again, that requires zero taste. Anybody can say that. Anybody can just say, \"Everything is horrible.\"\n\n(33:53):\nSo I do think there is something about being able to understand that, and I think I'll share some examples. This two-way door thing, so let me just share a few observations, if I might. So the first one is we get overly excited about cool metaphors, okay? Like, one-way door, two-way doors. There's some guy, I don't know who it is, I just read somewhere, there's some guy who had written a blog post about this idea, but he called it reversible and irreversible decisions, and it was the same idea. And I think somebody was lamenting that that did not catch on, reversible and irreversible decisions. But what caught on is two-way door and one-way door. What's the difference? The only difference is you got attracted to the catchy metaphor, and the other one is the authority bias, because Bezos said it.\n\n(34:58):\nTake another example, we get very impressed with alliterations. I'm serious, we get very impressed with alliterations. Okay, so how many of us love fail fast? Fail fast, okay, nobody's going to raise hands now. Okay, fine. Maybe you truly don't love fail fast. How about fast follow? How many of you love fast follow? Let's consider that, like fail fast, \"We're going to fail fast.\" What if that thing were called fail quickly? It's the same meaning. Do you think you would be as attracted to that idea if it were called fail quickly?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:44):\nNo.\n\nShreyas Doshi (35:46):\nProbably not, so what changed? The only thing that changed is one is an alliteration. So I see this in everything. Like, let's see, the other one is we also get very impressed with complicated charts and math we don't understand. And some of you product leaders who are at the top of the game, you actually use this as a strategy. So as I realized that here's the outcome of that, asking myself that question, was that what I realized is everybody says, \"Oh, I'm a first principle thinker. I am a rigorous thinker,\" whatever.\n\n(36:41):\nBut I realized that if I really want to be that, I have to shed a lot of these just patterns that were just built in me, and I kind of have to evaluate the idea separate from all of its social proof, and authority proof, and whatever else. And that ended up being a meaningful change in my growth as a product leader, because the moment I started shedding these kinds of social proofs, and authority proofs, and all of that, it just made me a much... We all again think we are critical thinkers, but we are not, right? So it made me a more critical thinker.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (37:31):\nI want to move on to the next question, just so we can get through some of these questions. Before I do, can you just show people your notes real quick, just like show it from a distance? This is how Shreyas plans for something like this. There's color coding, I wish I understood what was going on there.\n\nShreyas Doshi (37:49):\nPeople ask me, \"What's your favorite note-taking app?\" It's a common question I get, and I say this, right? It's a $5... Like I guess the pen costs $3, and I think the Office Depot clipboard costs-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:00):\nWait, doesn't that pen... Does it have the different color clicky thing?\n\nShreyas Doshi (38:02):\nYes, yes, yeah. A [inaudible 00:38:04]. Yeah, exactly. This is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:06):\nThat's going to be another podcast episode. Okay, so we want to try to do two more questions. We have six minutes left. The last one's a bonus, so maybe we touch on it briefly. Shreyas, what's your third question?\n\nShreyas Doshi (38:18):\nSo my third question is why does my job feel so frustrating? Why does my job feel so frustrating? And it goes back to the point that, look, I loved, loved my PM leadership job. I just absolutely loved it. And I think looking back, I would not have exchanged it for anything else, any other experience. That said, there were daily frustrations. There were daily frustrations in that job, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the PM leader's job is extremely lonely. The PM's job, the PM's on your team, their job is also lonely. But a PM leader's job is further lonelier. So there's that. There's also what I learned at the time when I started asking this question is that our jobs get frustrating when we behave, most of the time, in misalignment with our superpowers and who we truly are at our core.\n\n(39:32):\nOkay, so for me, as I was evaluating that question, it's like, \"Why am I getting frustrated every day? I love the job, I love the macro, but I do not like the micro. And so why is that?\" And that's when I actually... There's a simple framework that I've shared, which is you can be doing your work at three levels. Product work happens at three levels. There's the impact level, there's the execution level, and there's the optics level. My epiphany as I was exploring this question was I have a preferred level at which I like to operate, but if most of the day, and most of the week, and most of the month, I am forcing myself to operate in not my happy place, in my non-default level, that makes me very frustrated.\n\n(40:33):\nSo many product leaders, their happy place is the execution level. In my case, my happy place is the impact level. So that is fine. Your happy place can be whatever level, it doesn't matter. But the point is, as you go higher up in the corporate ladder, no matter what kind of company it is, you are now going to have to spend a lot of time on optics, at the optics level. And I have willpower, I have the skills to do it, I have all of that. So it's not about willpower or skills, but willpower is finite. So as I spent day in and day out, just mostly doing optics work, I realized I was not happy and I was getting frustrated. And so that's when I realized the solution, which is I have to abandon the traditional path, that like, \"Oh, after this level, I'm supposed to do this, and then I'm supposed to do this, and then this is what society expects. This is what my mom expects. What will people say on LinkedIn when they see my LinkedIn profile?\" Like, \"Oh, he has this progression, this, and then what stopped? Why did it stop?\"\n\n(41:49):\nSo when I realized this, I said, when a team grew to a certain size, so when I was at Stripe and I realized this, when the team I was managing, it had a fan out of about 50 people, so this includes engineers and everything, I said, \"This is enough.\" Because for me, any time a team goes to like 50s, and 100s, and beyond, it is a law of corporations that you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the optics level. So instead of just pushing, pushing through against who I truly am, what did I do? I just went back to more of an earlier stage product, and then I was fine with like, \"You know what? I'm not going to just play the corporate game,\" as an example.\n\n(42:34):\nSo I guess my suggestion would be identify your superpowers, and like Shakespeare said, \"To thine own self be true.\" Just be honest to yourself. Operate your career and make your career decisions not out of expectation, not out of envy, like the LinkedIn envy of like, \"Oh, this person is at a different level. We both went to the same grad school, so I got...\" No, identify your superpowers, because if you identify your superpowers and work in accordance with them, you will do the best work of your life. You will love it, and you will be great at it, and you won't have that frustration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:23):\nI wish we had an hour for every single one of these questions, I feel like there's so much more to get into. We have 40 seconds. Do you want to touch on your last question or do you want to leave that for a follow-up discussion?\n\nShreyas Doshi (43:35):\nLet's touch on it, let's touch on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:37):\nOkay, we got to go though in 30 seconds.\n\nShreyas Doshi (43:38):\nAll right. My last question is am I really listening? Okay, and this is perhaps the hardest one for me, because I thought, of course I'm a good listener because I listen, then I recap, and I make eye contact, and I tell them, \"This is what I heard,\" And all of that nonsense. I realized there is an entirely other level to listening, which once you understand that there's an entirely other level to listening, that is what enables you to be a world-class leader. And so that is what I guess my last takeaway is, is ask yourself, \"Am I really listening?\" If you want resources, there are very few people who actually talk about what that real listening means. I would refer you to what Rick Rubin says about listening, I would refer you to what [inaudible 00:44:30] said about listening, and what Drucker said about listening as some pointers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:36):\nAmazing. Shreyas, you said you were going to hang out for the next hour somewhere. You want to share that real quick, and then we'll get off?\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:42):\nYes, I will maybe try to hang out in the back part of the room.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:46):\nBe quiet back there, too.\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:47):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:47):\nShreyas, thank you so much for being here.\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:50):\nGreat, thank you. Oh, should we take a picture?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:54):\nOh, yeah. We're going to take a quick selfie.\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:59):\nWe're going to take a picture.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:59):\nThere we go. They're going to turn lights on, I think.\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:59):\nOh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:00):\nOkay.\n\nShreyas Doshi (45:03):\nAll right, folks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:07):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "然后我注意到，在某个时候，这让我变得非常忙碌，然后这又让我感到内疚，因为我有团队要照顾和支持，还有产品决策要做以及其他各种事情，而我还参加了一些规划闭门会议之类的。\n\n(11:15):\n然后你看，这样持续了四、五、六周，这听起来熟悉吗？是吧？好的，所以我注意到我需要在某个时候改变这种状况，实际上我找到了一个解决方案，虽然是在我职业生涯的后期，但我确实找到了解决方案，因为我问了自己这个问题：\"我为什么这么忙？我在做所有提高效率的事情，我像冠军一样管理我的待办事项清单。我的日历安排得恰到好处。我的日程安排得恰到好处。我在锻炼身体，这样我在工作时才能保持专注，我很高效，我做了所有这些。我为什么还这么忙？哦，是规划季，而这应该需要四到六周时间。\" 这是我在 Stripe 时遇到的情况。所以这应该需要四到六周时间。\n\n(12:03):\n嗯，我意识到你不必这样做。所以在我在 Stripe 工作的某个时候，我意识到了以下这点：我们会进行各种规划仪式，持续四到六周。然后，我们完成规划并与高管分享我们的计划。你知道他们会问什么问题，比如：\"如果不考虑资金，你会做什么？你的宏大计划是什么？如果我们再给你五个工程师，你会做什么？你还会在路线图中包含哪些其他内容？\" 对吧？标准问题。所以你完成规划，做演示，然后发布计划，接着以很大的热情和兴奋开始新的一年。一月份进展顺利，直到你遇到三个客户升级需求，要求的功能不在你的计划中。所以现在，你要想办法如何重新分配资源。\n\n(13:03):\n你去找某个依赖团队，他们会支持这些来自客户升级需求的新功能。你经历这个过程，然后再次修改你的计划。然后，通常到二月最后一周的时候，每个人都忘记了实际的计划。现在，我们在执行某个其他地方的清单。顺便说一句，当你有时礼貌地提到这一点时，你可能会说：\"你知道，我注意到我们实际上并没有真正使用我们花了至少四到六周时间做的那个计划。\" 然后，房间里某个聪明人插话说：\"计划是无用的，但规划就是一切。\"\n\n(13:52):\n我不知道，Eisenhower，还是别人，我不知道是谁说的，\"计划是无用的，但规划就是一切。\" 没人知道这是什么意思。没人知道这意味着什么，但每个人都很赞同，\"啊，计划是无用的，但规划就是一切。\" 对吧？所以我经历了几年这样的情况。然后我说，\"你知道吗？我要在这里打破一些规则。\" 所以我意识到，Lenny，你不必经历这四到六周，这是个意外。基本上，当时发生的是，我正在做的产品，Stripe Connect，它是 Stripe 的一个主要产品，对 Stripe 来说是一项重要的业务。我为这个产品制定了一个产品策略，一个真正的产品策略。\n\n(14:44):\n所以这应该是在那年早些时候。然后，规划季到来了。我发现有趣的是，因为我有一个真正的产品策略，不是那些假的，一个真正的产品策略，我已经与所有人达成了一致，我对这个 Stripe 主要产品的规划只花了大约三天时间。对吧，所以当我的很多同事不幸地为他们自己的产品陷入四到六周的规划、会议、等等等等的循环时，我只用了三天就把所有东西整理好了，无论需要什么文档，我都准备好了。\n\n(15:27):\n我没有填写一些模板。这就是打破规则的地方，因为如果一个模板没有意义，我为什么要填写它？没有必要填写它。所以那时我意识到，实际上，如果你有一个真正的产品策略，一个每个人都认同的真正策略，你已经提前达成了一致，那么我们在年度规划中倾向于做的很多废话实际上就消失了。现在，你仍然需要做一些资源分配之类的事情，但即使在那里，你也不需要那种虚假的精确性。你们有多少人曾经争论过，\"那么 2025 年这个团队应该是八个工程师，还是九个工程师？\"\n\n(16:11):\n谁在乎呢？我们都知道，即使是我们设定的那些数字，当 2025 年实际到来时，我们实际上也不会遵守它们。所以这只是一个例子，说明我们在一些我们认为是战略性的、我们认为很重要的事情上花了很多时间，但实际上，我们应该把时间花在其他杠杆作用更大的事情上。对吧，现在它确实需要一些前期工作，在这种情况下是在清晰的产品策略上的前期工作，每个人都理解，每个人都认同。但坦率地说，如果你有了这个，规划应该是轻而易举的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:49):\n那么对于想要做得更好的人，你有什么战术性的建议？我知道可能有十亿个你分享的这类例子，所以规划是一个例子。对于那些想要不那么忙碌的人，也许在这一点上是给自己很少的时间，专注于策略，让它成为计划，基本上，而不是每个人和他们未来六个月的路线图。你会分享什么建议？然后，我想继续下一个问题，因为我想确保我们能回答所有这些问题。\n\nShreyas Doshi (17:18):\n是的，肯定有一个具体的建议，那就是如果你确实有一个策略，它会让你的很多优先级问题消失，它会让很多规划问题消失。即使你确实有一些来自销售的升级需求，你会有的，或者来自支持部门，或者其他地方，你现在至少有一个更严格的框架来决定如何处理那个升级需求。所以肯定有这个。\n\n(17:48):\n但我认为我想分享的另一件事是，这是我在问\"我为什么这么忙？\"这个问题时的另一个认识，我意识到我之所以这么忙，是因为我没有做出好的产品决策。好吧，现在，你要明白，到这个时候我已经做了大约 15 年的产品，诸如此类的，做了 11 年的产品经理。所以我认为我很不错。这是我的自我形象。但是，如果我对自己诚实的话，我没有做出我能做出的那么好的产品决策。所以我能分享一个例子吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:32):\n请讲。\n\nShreyas Doshi (18:34):\n所以我注意到，你会为某个产品功能开一个会，这个功能不知怎么被请求了或者真的很重要，不管是什么情况。所以你和一些利益相关者以及你的工程团队、设计师等开会。然后，你试图决定，\"我们应该构建这个吗？\" 有人说，\"你知道吗？我们为什么要为这个开会？\" 我在某处读到或者我听 Bezos 说过双向门，这是一个双向门。你快速做决定。就是，快速做决定然后继续前进。这是一个双向门。所以你说，\"是的,没错。\" 每次我们听到这样的话，双向门，你会想，\"哦，那个人真聪明，所以我想像他们一样。\"\n\n(19:32):\n所以我注意到我自己和我的团队，我们在做这些决定时没有非常清楚地思考客户动机，没有非常清楚地思考差异化，没有非常清楚地思考无论这个功能是什么的分发方法。虽然这听起来像，\"哦，你当然应该这样做，\" 但我向你保证，这不是大多数产品团队的工作方式。他们在谈论，\"嗯，工程师 Bob 会有空吗？他们什么时候有空？如果他们有空，那我们就构建这个功能。\" 这就是很多产品决策的发生方式。\n\n(20:11):\n这种方法的挑战在于，再次强调,这是在实践中发生的，我不是在谈论你读到的什么理论，这是在实践中发生的。所以当你遵循这种方法并假设，\"哦，这是一个双向门，我们可以取消这个功能，\" 实际上，它不会那样发展，因为这是现实中发生的情况。在现实中，你承诺做这个功能，它需要五、六周时间来做，然后再多几周时间来确保，来推广它，等等，对吧？所以现在功能出来了，现在你有了 Q1 QBR，对吧？比如从现在起两个月后你有 Q1 QBR，你要做业务回顾演示，诸如此类。你要展示你做了什么，\"你上个季度做了什么？你上个季度的发布表现如何？\"\n\n(21:03):\n所以现在，是时候在 QBR 上谈论这个功能了，因为你必须分享它。现在当你开始谈论这个功能时，CEO 会问，\"所以是的，我们推出了这个功能。我很高兴我们推出了这个功能。它表现如何？\" 你想要能够说，你是 PM 负责人，你想要能够说一些聪明的话，一些让你看起来很称职的话。但挑战是这个功能没有多少采用率。所以我不会要求任何人举手，但我认为大多数 PM 都熟悉这个困境。当然，作为产品负责人,我们在口头上非常灵活。所以我们说的是，我们没有数据，所以我们使用有利的轶事。\n\n(21:53):\n所以我们说，\"是的，我们推出了这个功能，你知道吗？这家公司的这个客户真的很喜欢这个功能。\" 我们放入一个轶事，就像，\"改变人生的功能。\" 他们是唯一使用它的人并不重要。那不重要。\n\n区别是什么？唯一的区别就是你被那个朗朗上口的比喻吸引了，而另一个则是权威偏见，因为是 Bezos 说的。\n\n(34:58):\n再举个例子，我们很容易被头韵吸引。我是认真的，我们真的很容易被头韵吸引。好，我们当中有多少人喜欢\"fail fast\"（快速失败）？Fail fast，好吧，现在没人举手了。好吧，没关系。也许你们确实不喜欢 fail fast。那\"fast follow\"（快速跟随）呢？你们当中有多少人喜欢 fast follow？想想看，就像 fail fast，\"我们要快速失败。\"如果这个概念叫\"fail quickly\"会怎样？意思是一样的。你觉得如果叫 fail quickly，你还会那么被这个想法吸引吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:44):\n不会。\n\nShreyas Doshi (35:46):\n很可能不会，那么改变的是什么？唯一改变的就是一个是头韵。所以我在所有事情上都看到这一点。比如，另一个是我们也很容易被复杂的图表和我们不理解的数学公式所折服。你们当中一些顶尖的产品领导者，实际上会把这个当作策略来用。所以当我意识到这一点时，问自己这个问题的结果是，我意识到每个人都说，\"哦，我是第一性原理思考者。我是严谨的思考者\"，诸如此类。\n\n(36:41):\n但我意识到，如果我真的想成为那样的人，我必须摆脱很多这些已经在我身上形成的模式，我必须把想法与它所有的社会认同、权威认同等等分开来评估。这最终成为了我作为产品领导者成长过程中的一个重要转变，因为从我开始摆脱这些社会认同、权威认同等等的那一刻起，这让我变得更加……我们都认为自己是批判性思考者，但其实不是，对吧？所以这让我成为了一个更有批判性的思考者。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (37:31):\n我想继续下一个问题，这样我们才能讲完这些问题。在此之前，你能不能给大家展示一下你的笔记？就从远处展示一下？这就是 Shreyas 为这种场合做准备的方式。还有颜色编码，真希望我能理解那是怎么回事。\n\nShreyas Doshi (37:49):\n人们问我，\"你最喜欢的笔记应用是什么？\"这是我经常被问到的问题，我会这样说，对吧？这是一支5美元的……我想这支笔要3美元，我觉得 Office Depot 的记事板要——\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:00):\n等等，那支笔……它是不是有那种多色按压的东西？\n\nShreyas Doshi (38:02):\n是的，是的，对。一支（听不清）。是的，没错。这太棒了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:06):\n这会是另一期播客的话题。好的，我们想试着再讲两个问题。我们还有六分钟。最后一个是附加题，所以也许我们简单提一下。Shreyas，你的第三个问题是什么？\n\nShreyas Doshi (38:18):\n我的第三个问题是，为什么我的工作让人感觉如此沮丧？为什么我的工作让人感觉如此沮丧？这又回到了这一点，你看，我热爱、热爱我的 PM 领导工作。我真的非常热爱它。我想回过头来看，我不会把它换成任何其他东西，任何其他经历。但话虽如此，那份工作中每天都有沮丧的时刻。每天都有沮丧，很大程度上是因为 PM 领导者的工作极其孤独。你团队中的 PM，他们的工作也很孤独。但 PM 领导者的工作更加孤独。所以就是这样。还有我当时开始问这个问题时学到的是，当我们的行为大部分时间与我们的核心优势和真实的自我不一致时，我们的工作就会变得令人沮丧。\n\n(39:32):\n好，所以对我来说，当我在评估这个问题时，我想，\"为什么我每天都感到沮丧？我热爱这份工作，我热爱宏观层面，但我不喜欢微观层面。那么为什么会这样？\"就在那时，我实际上……我分享过一个简单的框架，就是你可以在三个层面做你的工作。产品工作在三个层面上进行。有影响力层面，有执行层面，还有公关层面。我在探索这个问题时的顿悟是，我有一个我喜欢运作的首选层面，但如果一天中的大部分时间、一周中的大部分时间、一个月中的大部分时间，我都在强迫自己在不是我舒适区的层面运作，在我的非默认层面运作，这会让我非常沮丧。\n\n(40:33):\n所以很多产品领导者，他们的舒适区是执行层面。而在我的情况下，我的舒适区是影响力层面。这都没问题。你的舒适区可以是任何层面，这不重要。但关键是，当你在公司阶梯上爬得越高，无论是什么类型的公司，你现在都必须花很多时间在公关上，在公关层面。我有意志力，我有技能去做这件事，我拥有所有这些。所以这不是关于意志力或技能的问题，但意志力是有限的。所以当我日复一日地主要做公关工作时，我意识到我不开心，我感到沮丧。所以那时我意识到了解决方案，那就是我必须放弃传统路径，比如，\"哦，在这个级别之后，我应该做这个，然后我应该做这个，然后这是社会期望的。这是我妈妈期望的。当人们在 LinkedIn 上看到我的简历时会怎么说？\"就像，\"哦，他有这样的发展轨迹，这个，然后呢，为什么停了？为什么停了？\"\n\n(41:49):\n所以当我意识到这一点时，我说，当一个团队发展到一定规模时，所以当我在 Stripe 的时候，我意识到了这一点，当我管理的团队扩展到大约50人时，这包括工程师和所有人，我说，\"这就够了。\"因为对我来说，任何时候一个团队达到50人、100人甚至更多，这是企业的法则，你将不得不花大量时间在公关层面。所以与其继续违背我的真实自我推进，我做了什么？我只是回到了一个更早期的产品，然后我就满足于，\"你知道吗？我不会只是玩企业游戏\"，举个例子。\n\n(42:34):\n所以我想我的建议是，识别你的核心优势，就像 Shakespeare 说的，\"对自己要真诚。\"只要对自己诚实。运营你的职业生涯，做出职业决定，不要出于期望，不要出于嫉妒，比如 LinkedIn 嫉妒，\"哦，这个人在不同的级别。我们都上了同一所研究生院，所以我必须……\"不，识别你的核心优势，因为如果你识别了你的核心优势并与之协调工作，你将完成你人生中最好的工作。你会热爱它，你会擅长它，你也不会有那种沮丧感。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:23):\n我真希望我们对每一个问题都有一个小时的时间，我觉得还有很多内容可以深入探讨。我们还有40秒。你想谈谈你的最后一个问题，还是想留到后续讨论？\n\nShreyas Doshi (43:35):\n我们来谈谈吧，来谈谈。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:37):\n好的，但我们得在30秒内讲完。\n\nShreyas Doshi (43:38):\n好的。我的最后一个问题是，我真的在倾听吗？好，这可能是对我来说最难的一个，因为我以为，我当然是一个好的倾听者，因为我倾听，然后我复述，我进行眼神交流，我告诉他们，\"这是我听到的\"，诸如此类的废话。我意识到倾听还有一个完全不同的层次，一旦你理解了倾听还有一个完全不同的层次，那就是能让你成为世界级领导者的关键。所以这就是我最后的心得，问问自己，\"我真的在倾听吗？\"如果你想要资源，很少有人真正谈论真正的倾听意味着什么。我会推荐你去看看 Rick Rubin 关于倾听的说法，我会推荐你去看看（听不清）关于倾听的说法，以及 Drucker 关于倾听的说法作为一些参考。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:36):\n太棒了。Shreyas，你说你接下来一个小时会在某个地方。你想快速分享一下吗，然后我们就结束？\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:42):\n是的，我可能会尝试在房间后面待着。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:46):\n在那边也保持安静哦。\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:47):\n好的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:47):\nShreyas，非常感谢你来到这里。\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:50):\n很好，谢谢。哦，我们应该拍张照片吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:54):\n哦，对。我们要快速自拍一下。\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:59):\n我们要拍张照片。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:59):\n来了。我想他们会把灯打开。\n\nShreyas Doshi (44:59):\n哦。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:00):\n好的。\n\nShreyas Doshi (45:03):\n好了，各位。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:07):\n非常感谢收听。如果你觉得有价值，可以在 Apple Podcasts、Spotify 或你喜欢的播客应用上订阅这个节目。另外，也请考虑给我们评分或留下评论，因为这真的能帮助其他听众找到这个播客。你可以在 lennyspodcast.com 找到所有过往剧集或了解更多关于这个节目的信息。下期节目见。",
