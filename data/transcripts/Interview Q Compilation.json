  "en": "Lenny (00:03):\nWelcome to a very special episode of the podcast.

She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.\n\nEeke De Miliano (03:36):\n\"To what do you attribute your success?\" And you can't say \"luck\". Because I think humble people will always say \"luck\" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.\n\nLenny (03:58):\nNext up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.\n\nGeoff Charles (04:06):\nI ask, \"What's the hardest thing you've ever done?\" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.\n\nLenny (04:31):\nNext up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (04:56):\nIt's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, \"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14].\" This question will actually work well for any role. But say, \"You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?\" That's the whole question.\n\n(05:23):\nUsually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, \"Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?\" All these different questions come out.\n\n(05:39):\nI'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, \"Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?\"\n\n(05:59):\nInterestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, \"Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?\" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. \"Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?\"\n\n(06:31):\nThe second one is, \"Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?\"\n\n(06:37):\nAnd then he took those two questions, and he said, \"Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants.\" You can say, \"Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run.\" Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, \"Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it.\"\n\n(06:59):\nOn the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.\n\n(07:12):\nIf it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, \"Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?\"\n\n(07:32):\nBut these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.\n\n(07:45):\nThat question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, \"I guess I would ask them what size it is.\" I'm like, \"Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?\" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.\n\n(08:16):\nBut then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, \"How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?\" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, \"What is the question that really drives this answer?\"\n\nLenny (08:45):\nThis next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.\n\nYuhki Yamashita (08:53):\n\"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?\" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.\n\n(09:25):\nOr sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, \"Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on.\" The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, \"Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.\n\nLenny (09:57):\nNext you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.\n\nKatie Dill (10:12):\n\"Tell me what work you are most proud of?\" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.\n\nKarri Saarinen (10:36):\nI think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.\n\nCamille Hearst (11:04):\nI like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.\n\nLenny (11:29):\nNext is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.\n\nJiaona Zhang (11:35):\nI do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?\n\n(11:44):\nAmbiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, \"Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity,\" but actually put a path forward.\n\n(12:05):\nI think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, \"Yep, this is the way. This is very clear.\" Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, \"This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together.\" And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, \"Hey, is this working? Is this not working?\" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.\n\nLenny (12:44):\nNext up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.\n\nNoah Weiss (12:49):\n\"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?\" When I say \"unfair\" or \"secret\", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. \"What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?\" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.\n\nLenny (13:11):\nThis next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.\n\nBen Williams (13:22):\n\"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?\" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.\n\n(13:49):\nAlso, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking \"why\" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.\n\n(14:08):\nAnd then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, \"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?\" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.\n\nLenny (14:42):\nNext up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):\n\"What would your siblings say about you?\" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, \"What will your parents say about you?\" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.\n\nLenny (15:00):\nWhat do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):\nI look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, \"My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together,\" that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, \"Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me,\" that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.\n\nLenny (15:30):\nNext is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (15:36):\nI like to ask, \"Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?\" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.\n\nLenny (16:15):\nWe are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.\n\nNikhyl Singhal (16:25):\n\"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?\" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, \"Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?\" And you could do that for, \"What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?\" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.\n\n(16:53):\nI'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.\n\n(17:19):\nThere's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate.\" When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.\n\nLenny (17:52):\nThis next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.\n\nAyo Omojola (18:01):\n\"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work,\" or, \"Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work.\" A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, \"Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?\"\n\nLenny (18:21):\nNext up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.\n\nScott Belsky (18:31):\nI like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.\n\n(18:49):\nI also like the question, \"Do you consider yourself lucky?\" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.\n\nLenny (19:18):\nOur penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.\n\nLauryn Isford (19:26):\n\"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.\" I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.\n\nLenny (19:46):\nOur final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.\n\nPaul Adams (20:00):\nI have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, \"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?\" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.\n\nLenny (20:23):\nAnd it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable.

  "zh": "我认为这个问题很能说明问题，因为如果他们能够设置这种冲突场景，理解为什么这个问题真的很重要，并且能代表双方立场，让你理解为什么这个冲突一开始会存在，而且他们能以一种平和的方式做到这一点，让你意识到他们可以从这些不同的视角看问题，你就能开始更深入地了解这个人了。\n\n(09:25):\n或者有时候我只是问他们一些基本的问题，比如：\"好的，聊聊你做过的一个重大项目。\" 我的思维实验总是这样的：听完之后，我是否会被激发去解决那个问题？对吧？无论表面上听起来多么无聊，我认为一个真正优秀的产品经理会施展某种魔力。就像是：\"这就是为什么它如此关键，这就是为什么它如此有趣，真的能凝聚团队士气。\" 这是讲故事和沟通能力的一个重要体现，因为说到底，我们工作中很大一部分就是围绕这些展开的。\n\nLenny (09:57):\n接下来你会听到 Katie Dill，Stripe 设计负责人；Karri Saarine，Linear 的 CEO；以及 Camille Hearst，Spotify 产品负责人、前 Patreon 产品负责人；他们都分享了同一个最喜欢的面试问题。\n\nKatie Dill (10:12):\n\"告诉我你最自豪的工作是什么？\" 我问这个问题的原因是，它能帮助我了解他们的品味和判断力，了解是什么激励着他们，他们认为什么样的工作是好的，什么样的结果是好的。它还能帮助我了解他们喜欢做什么，以及他们的重心在哪里。\n\nKarri Saarinen (10:36):\n我通常喜欢问候选人在职业生涯或其他方面最自豪的是什么，以及为什么。他们最自豪的是什么？为什么？我觉得这能让你了解这个人的价值观以及他们的思考方式。而且，我认为让人们分享他们认为自己做得很好的事情总是很好的，我们可以花时间讨论这个，而不是只问一些负面的问题。\n\nCamille Hearst (11:04):\n我喜欢让人们告诉我他们完成的、真正引以为豪的事情，带我了解整个过程，并告诉我他们为什么感到自豪。我发现你可以从中了解到很多关于一个人的动机、工作态度、他们关心什么、他们眼中的优秀是什么样的，我认为如果你要和一个人密切合作，这些都是非常重要的信息。\n\nLenny (11:29):\n接下来是 JZ，Webflow 产品负责人，我以前在 Airbnb 的同事，分享她最喜欢的面试问题。\n\nJiaona Zhang (11:35):\n我确实喜欢问行为类问题。就是真正了解，当他们遇到挑战性情况时，当他们处于模糊情况时，他们是如何应对的？\n\n(11:44):\n模糊性对我来说是个大问题，因为说到底，PM 的工作真的很模糊。你很难在纸面上描述出你将要遇到的所有事情。好的答案是那些能在模糊中建立结构和前进方向的人。这就是你要寻找的。你希望你的 PM 不只是说：\"哦不，我们在模糊中挣扎\"，而是真正地开辟出一条前进的道路。\n\n(12:05):\n我认为，还要寻找那些会寻求帮助、寻求这些输入的人，而不是那种\"是的，就是这样。这很清楚\"的人。因为，再说一次，无论你为任何产品、为你正在做的任何事情规划的路径，第一次就是正确路径的可能性都非常小。所以我想看到有人能够获得这些输入，能够说：\"这就是路径。这就是我如何学习并制定这条路径的原因。\" 然后回到我认为我们在这个播客中谈到的很多内容，比如，有哪些小的里程碑能让你判断：\"嘿，这有用吗？这不行吗？\" 然后让你做出不同的决定。看到人们把这个做得很好是我寻找的重点。\n\nLenny (12:44):\n接下来是 Noah Weiss，Slack 的首席产品官。\n\nNoah Weiss (12:49):\n\"你学到了哪些不为人知的秘诀来提升产品团队的速度和活力？\" 当我说\"不为人知\"或\"秘诀\"时，我通常指的不是你可能在媒体上读到的东西。\"你学到了什么？你是怎么学到的？它是如何运作的，你又是如何应用的？\" 问这个问题你也能得到一些令人惊叹、有趣的灵感。\n\nLenny (13:11):\n下一个问题来自声音非常磁性的 Ben Williams，前 Snyk 产品副总裁，现在是 产品驱动增长 初创公司的顾问。\n\nBen Williams (13:22):\n\"快进三年，那时的你有什么不同？\" 很多人会默认告诉你他们渴望达到的职位或头衔，但我真正寻找的是谦逊、自我认知的信号，关于个人和职业成长领域的信号。那些能够坦诚面对自己认为需要努力成长的地方的人。我喜欢这样的人。\n\n(13:49):\n另外，在整个面试过程中，我还在寻找好奇心。在日常工作中，优秀的 PM 会像我六岁的儿子一样经常问\"为什么\"，问得非常多，所以我会尝试在对话过程中辨别这一点。这不是一个问题，而是我在寻找的东西。\n\n(14:08):\n然后也许我想反过来说，因为这呼应了 Adam Fishman 说的，他的主题是在面试公司时评估你可能要共事的人的人性维度。这是我最近被候选人问到的一个问题，我觉得非常精彩，那就是：\"告诉我你最近亲身参与过的多样性、公平、包容和归属感举措是什么？\" 这感觉是一个非常好的方式，让他们能够测试自己的个人价值观是否与他们将密切合作的人的价值观一致，所以我很喜欢这个问题。\n\nLenny (14:42):\n接下来是 Meltem Kuran Berkowitz，Deel 的增长负责人和非常早期的员工。\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):\n\"你的兄弟姐妹会怎么评价你？\" 这很能说明问题。如果他们有兄弟姐妹的话；如果没有，我会问：\"你的父母会怎么说你？\" 但是你认为别人怎么看你，这很能说明问题。\n\nLenny (15:00):\n你在他们的回答中寻找什么，来判断他们是不是好的候选人？\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):\n我寻找真诚和自我认知。你的兄弟姐妹永远不会……我是说，我爱我妹妹，但她会打电话给我，会跟我说很多。意识到这一点非常重要。如果有人说：\"我的兄弟姐妹会说我非常有条理，我是把家庭凝聚在一起的人\"，那可能是胡扯的答案。但如果他们说：\"哦，是的，他们会说我的一些奇怪的事情\"，这显示出一点自我认知和谦逊，这是我想在一个人身上看到的。\n\nLenny (15:30):\n接下来是 Paige Costello，Asana 的产品管理联合负责人，也是 AI 负责人。\n\nPaige Costello (15:36):\n我喜欢问：\"告诉我一次出问题的经历。是什么？你做了什么？\" 等等。实际上，这个问题涉及的是，当产品失败时，当团队的某些方面不起作用时，就是那些会出错的事情，因为这就是你做这项工作时会发生的。评估人们的心态、他们谈论它的方式，以及他们评估情况的方式，我认为这是一个很好的问题。它真的能告诉你很多关于人们如何思考以及当事情进展不顺利时他们如何看待自己。\n\nLenny (16:15):\n我们现在进入最后阶段了。只剩下五个面试问题了。接下来是 Nikhyl Singhal，Facebook 产品副总裁，也是播客中最受欢迎的一期之一。\n\nNikhyl Singhal (16:25):\n\"有什么是大家都认为理所当然的，但你认为本质上是胡说八道或不准确的？\" 有时我会问一个管理者：\"看，你在职业生涯中管理过数百人。有什么传统智慧是你不认同的，你发现实际上是不准确的？\" 你也可以这样问：\"人们对 AI 的哪些看法是不准确的，但每个人都相信？\" 你可以针对不同领域问这个问题。你可以做各种各样的事情。\n\n(16:53):\n我总是希望人们打破这种面试心态。每个人总是为面试做准备，然后他们的整个对话都在预测你认为你想让我说什么。结果是，你可能会拒绝一些高质量的人，因为他们不够真实。\n\n(17:19):\n这个问题没有办法不真诚地有主见地回答。因为它从\"你认为什么是……？我想坐在这里，然后告诉我为什么它不准确\"开始。当我打破那堵墙时，我在测试，这个人真实吗？因为有时候我拒绝他们是因为他们没告诉我任何新东西。但我不想让面试过程惩罚他们，这是我的保底问题。\n\nLenny (17:52):\n下一个问题来自 Ayo Omojola，Carbon Health 的首席产品官，前 Square 产品负责人，也是前创始人。\n\nAyo Omojola (18:01):\n\"告诉我你做的某件奏效的事情，但不是因为你认为它会奏效的原因\"，或者\"告诉我你做的某个好决定但没有成功的事情\"。我的很多过程就是引出内省。就像是：\"你是一个会反思自己所做决定的人吗？反思它们为什么有效、为什么无效，并将其融入你的模型中，以便下次做出不同的决定？\"\n\nLenny (18:21):\n接下来是 Scott Belsky，Adobe 首席战略官，前 Adobe 首席产品官，也是 Behance 的前创始人。\n\nScott Belsky (18:31):\n我喜欢问人们关于自己学到的、揭示他们工作方式局限性的事情。\n\n这是一种测试自省能力的方法，当这个人遇到极限或困难时，他们能够保持开放和自省吗？还是会责怪别人、推卸责任？所以我会问这个问题。\n\n(18:49):\n我还喜欢问这个问题：\"你认为自己幸运吗？\"我觉得这是个很有意思的问题，因为有些人对自己的处境和成就非常不自信，可能会拒绝承认运气的作用。而那些内心坦然的人应该会承认自己是幸运的。我的意思是，事实上，我们都非常幸运，也确实享有特权，我只是觉得这总能引发一场有趣的对话。\n\nLenny (19:18):\n倒数第二个面试问题来自 Lauryn Isford，Notion 的增长负责人，前 Airtable 增长负责人。\n\nLauryn Isford (19:26):\n\"跟我讲讲你交付过的一个有影响力的成果。\"我想了解他们如何定义影响力，以及这对他们意味着什么。我认为对于增长从业者来说，一个好的答案是表现出对业务产生影响的内在驱动力。\n\nLenny (19:46):\n我们最后一个面试问题实际上是关于背景调查电话的建议，这发生在通过面试流程找到优秀人选之后。这来自 Paul Adams，Intercom 的首席产品官，带着迷人的爱尔兰口音。\n\nPaul Adams (20:00):\n我必须打背调电话。你在面试某人，想给他们这份工作，他们有推荐人。当然，他们提供的推荐人都是和他们共事过的最好的人，以及他们最喜欢的经理。这个问题是：\"在这个人的第一次绩效评估中，我会给他什么反馈？\"这是个很棒的问题，因为对方无法回避。一定会有答案，而且非常有启发性。\n\nLenny (20:23):\n就这样了。非常感谢收听。希望这对你有价值。请在新闻通讯帖子、YouTube 评论区或者 Twitter 上留言。告诉我你的想法。如果反响不错，我们会继续做这类内容。如果反响不好，我们就再也不做了。好的，谢谢。祝你愉快。",
