Everyone's like, \"Yes, move fast, amazing quality.\" What's an example of that for you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:16):\nI communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.\n\nLenny (00:00:24):\nThere may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:27):\nI'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nYou built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:44):\nIs it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.\n\nLenny (00:00:56):\nToday, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.\n\n(00:01:19):\nIn our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:01):\nThis episode has something for anyone that's in product or interested in the role of product, and I'm very excited to bring it to you.

I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nI'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.\n\nClaire Vo (00:04:32):\nIt's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure.\n\n(00:04:53):\nI want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.\n\n(00:05:22):\nHere's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?\n\nClaire Vo (00:05:33):\nYeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.\n\n(00:05:56):\nBut when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.\n\n(00:06:20):\nAnd so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, \"Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?\"\n\n(00:06:49):\nAnd I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, \"This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD.\" And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, \"What can I do?\" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?\n\n(00:07:33):\nThe other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, \"I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it.\" And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, \"What do you want out of this role?\" And I said, \"I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step.\"\n\n(00:08:14):\nAnd so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. \"Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?\"\n\n(00:08:44):\nHigh-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.\n\nLenny (00:09:24):\nMaybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.\n\n(00:09:38):\nI have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. \"Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there.\" And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, \"I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level.\" And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?\n\nClaire Vo (00:10:06):\nYeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.\n\n(00:10:52):\nOne is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, \"I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports.\" Instead of saying, \"Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C.\"\n\n(00:11:43):\nThat's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.\n\n(00:12:19):\nSo, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, \"I want to get promoted.\"\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\nThat is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, \"Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating.\" I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. \"Here's what I can do to move things further.\"\n\n(00:13:06):\nAnd I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:15):\nYep, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nIs there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, \"Here's how I can help the org,\" and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:25):\nIt's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.\n\n(00:14:06):\nAnd so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.\n\n(00:14:32):\nAnd this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.\n\nLenny (00:15:08):\nI love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, \"Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design.\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:15:31):\nYeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.\n\n(00:15:58):\nAnd so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.\n\nLenny (00:16:30):\nAnd I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, \"Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:46):\nYep, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:48):\nThere's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:58):\nSOS.\n\nLenny (00:17:00):\nExactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?\n\nClaire Vo (00:17:08):\nI really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.\n\n(00:17:32):\nI truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?\n\n(00:18:04):\nAnd I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.\n\n(00:18:50):\nIndividually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.\n\nLenny (00:19:21):\nWe're going to talk about some of the things that you built.\n\n(00:19:23):\nIn terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].\n\nClaire Vo (00:19:32):\nYeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, \"How can I be here more?\" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.\n\n(00:20:26):\nI think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, \"What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?\" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.\n\nLenny (00:20:58):\nWhat's an example of that for you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:21:00):\nI think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.\n\n(00:21:31):\nAnd the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.\n\nLenny (00:21:58):\nAmazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.\n\n(00:22:29):\nOkay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, \"Yes, move fast, amazing quality.\" Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?\n\nClaire Vo (00:23:06):\nYeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.\n\n(00:23:23):\nAnd there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, \"Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting,\" it's, \"No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow.\"\n\n(00:23:58):\nThe other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.\n\n(00:24:51):\nThe third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, \"Do both very high rate,\" and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.\n\nLenny (00:25:27):\nI love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?\n\nClaire Vo (00:25:41):\nYeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, \"Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?\" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.\n\nLenny (00:26:26):\nAnd then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, \"Here's how I want to operate,\" and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.\n\nClaire Vo (00:26:41):\nYeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, \"We'll make the decision in the next meeting,\" or, \"We'll follow up on this in the next meeting.\" That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.\n\nLenny (00:27:12):\nAwesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?\n\nClaire Vo (00:27:17):\nYeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.\n\n(00:27:28):\nI'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.\n\n(00:27:51):\nAnd so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, \"Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar.\" And so I think that's very important.\n\n(00:28:39):\nThe second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, \"Clear is kind,\" I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.\n\n(00:29:08):\nI really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.\n\n(00:29:30):\nAnd I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.\n\nLenny (00:30:02):\nIs there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, \"Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:30:16):\nThere were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.\n\n(00:30:38):\nAnd the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, \"You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen.\" And I called both of them individually and I said, \"The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do.\" And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. \"I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow.\"\n\n(00:31:20):\nI wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, \"You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility.\" That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.\n\nLenny (00:31:55):\nThat's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, \"Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:16):\nAnd I honestly think saying, \"You are not doing a good job,\" is much kinder than, \"I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect.\" Or, \"I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at...\" That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.\n\nLenny (00:32:36):\nOkay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:40):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny (00:32:41):\nThis doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:58):\nYeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.\n\n(00:33:30):\nAnd look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.\n\n(00:34:09):\nAnd what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.\n\n(00:34:47):\nAnd as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, \"Oh, she did associate and all the way up,\" but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, \"Don't get pregnant,\" when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.\n\n(00:35:21):\nAnd I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.\n\n(00:35:46):\nAnd the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?\n\n(00:36:24):\nAnd then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.\n\nLenny (00:37:10):\nIs there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, \"Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:37:21):\nI've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, \"Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person.\"\n\n(00:38:11):\nAnd I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.\n\nLenny (00:38:50):\nAnd this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?\n\nClaire Vo (00:39:02):\nOne, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, \"My grandma's a software engineer?\"\n\n(00:39:35):\nBooks called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.\n\n(00:40:00):\nThe reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\nAnd is there an answer to how do we do this better? Anything you think, hey, you've seen work to help get us past this?\n\nClaire Vo (00:40:34):\nI think normalize seeing it, so thanks for bringing me on this podcast, but I do think normalize seeing it is one of the simplest ways. If you close your eyes and imagine a software engineer, my dream is you imagine a diverse set of folks. You don't imagine a very specific art type. And so I do think you can't believe it unless you see it, and so the more that you can provide platforms for diverse voices to talk about their journey in technology, expose that there are leaders out there that come from different backgrounds, technically, culturally, all those things, the more the industry can imagine different types of leaders in different types of roles.\n\n(00:41:17):\nAnd so I just want to see it more. I want to invest more and raise the voices of female founders. I want to call out their amazing female CTOs out there, all those things. And I think if you can see it, you can start to unlock these very embedded concepts of who is and is not a technology leader who is and is not technical.\n\nLenny (00:41:40):\nAwesome. I love that advice. It's something I try really hard to do with this podcast.\n\n(00:41:44):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I haven't actually heard the story.\n\nClaire Vo (00:42:45):\nYeah, this was a fun one. Again, this is the universe is bendable to your will and lean into your power, which is, I had been running Experiment Engine, which was a platform for enterprises to run high scale experimentation programs. Not necessarily the underlying A/B testing technology, but all the stuff around hypothesis gathering, insights, aggregation, operations, keeping things on track. Because I really know, as you do, that high scale experimentation programs can be very impactful to businesses.\n\n(00:43:19):\nThat being said, it was like a niche inside in industry, as opposed to a large TAM problem. And so I think we just fundamentally hit a TAM ceiling here. We had a great product for a great market that was very narrow. And three years, four years into running the company, I knew that to be true and I knew that we would be better served by being part of a larger organization, and one of those organizations could be a large testing company. And so I remember that was noodling on my mind, but we were also really trying to sell to enterprises.\n\n(00:43:52):\nAnd I heard that Microsoft, who was one of our biggest customers, was doing a experimentation day with Optimizely, and I knew Optimizely was a natural acquirer. And I knew I had to get into that room, so I called Microsoft and I said, \"Hey, friend of Microsoft, I'm going to be up in Seattle seeing our other customer, very large Seattle company, this week, week of experimentation day. Could we stop by?\" And they're like, \"Oh yeah, sure.\" Well, then I went to other big Seattle companies and said, \"Hey, other big Seattle company, I'm going to be up Microsoft at their experimentation day. Would you be...\"\n\n(00:44:34):\nI got these two meetings to manifest against each other, and then I walked into that experimentation day and I eyeballed the CFO of Optimizely and I sat in front of him and started pulling up the product and coding at the same time. I was just like, \"I'm going to sit in front of him in the row and I'm going to do this and we're going to have my screens.\" And then I went up and did a demo. And I'm not saying that's the thing that made it happen, but I will say very quickly after that, we became very close partners and ultimately they acquired me.\n\n(00:45:06):\nAnd I give this advice to founders because one of the things that, and founders and PMs, one of the things that I really hire for is scrappiness. I think you have to be able to do a lot with a little, and I think you have to know where you're getting and, come hell or high water, figure out a way to get there. And this was a very fun example of working my way into the right room, setting myself up for the success that I wanted, and having the backing, the good job, the great product, the outcomes to earn it. But you also have to get yourself in the room.\n\nLenny (00:45:39):\nAnd how many months pregnant were you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:45:44):\nI was extremely pregnant. A ticking time bomb of a belly is a really good negotiation tactic in a deal. I think I remember when we were negotiating the final term sheet, I was 34 weeks pregnant, something like that, and they said, \"Can you fly out to San Francisco?\" I was in Austin at the time. And I said, \"Literally, you can fly me out today and back tomorrow, and then I'm not allowed on planes.\" And that's how. It was very fun. It was fun, and what a happy acquisition. I can talk all day about how that was great. Great experience.\n\nLenny (00:46:11):\nAnd I love it's another example of the phrase you've been coming back to of bending, I don't know if it's bending the world to your will.\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:17):\nBending the universe towards your will.\n\nLenny (00:46:19):\nThe universe? Even bigger. I love it. It feels like a recurring theme here, is to take agency and control where your career and life is going. And that's such a good example of just finding a way into this room that would be very hard for someone to get into.\n\n(00:46:33):\nYou've touched on the CTPO role that I haven't heard much about. And I know that this is a big topic for you, and I feel like there might be a trend happening here of combining engineering product. Can you just talk about this role and why you think it might be emerging?\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:51):\nYeah, I get asked about it a lot because it's not super rare, but it's not super common either, and I think it could potentially be rising. And I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. It's very different. I've done both. It's very different than a pure product or a VP product role.\n\n(00:47:13):\nAnd so first, I talked a little bit about how I got into this role. I do think you have to be technical to do a role like this. I think a lot of people look at my professional background and think that I use my broad leadership skills and leverage of a great SVP to keep engineering team going. But no, actually I spent quite a bit of time on the engineering side, because as somebody who is responsible for the business outcomes of the product, one of the best ways to drive value is having a highly performant engineering team that works on a scalable platform.\n\n(00:47:45):\nAnd so I spend a lot of time making sure that we're building the right architectural decisions, that our infrastructure meets the needs of our team, that our edge team is operating in a way that drives velocity. And I just don't think you can do that job if you don't understand how software gets built on a technical level. So I'm the kind of person that when we're doing a product review, I have the PRD up and GitHub up and I'm comparing both, because I think both sides matter.\n\n(00:48:10):\nI think the other thing that's different about this role is it's quite operational, and so you really have to know about operations and organization design. Edge teams are by nature much larger than product organizations. You just think about the classic ratios, there are more people in engineering than there are in product. And the talent challenges are significantly different in engineering, whether it's the high volume of recruiting, culture-shaped challenges are different. You have to really think about org design. And so you have to have a different level of mindset around organization design and operations when you're in a CPTO role.\n\n(00:48:51):\nYou're on pager duty. You're getting paged at 1:00 AM if a service, if there's a Sub-Zero and it goes down. That is not what it's like to be a product leader. So you got to know what you're getting into and you have to be technical. And then the thing I would be remiss to say about this role is the P and the T get a lot of air time. Product and engineering get a lot of air time. Design data, these are such functional, very important organizations, and why these roles get... That's what the role is and how you could be good at it or whether it would be a fit for your skills.\n\n(00:49:24):\nThe question of why have this kind of role, and I think there's two reasons. There's the obvious strategic reason of, they're all the same thing. They're all building capital P product, they're all builders, they're the same types of folks, they're all builders, and bringing them under one house allows you to optimize for the whole, as opposed to optimize for the function. And if you can find a leader that is effective at that, I think you can get a lot of value added. And honestly, the second thing is it provides a tremendous amount of leverage to the CEO in many ways. At the end of the day, R&D is a very expensive and complicated investment the company is making, and having a single person responsible for R&D investment at the executive level is quite important, especially when you're candidly spending a lot there.\n\n(00:50:21):\nAnd so I think it's those two things. It's, these are one team. There should be be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design. It should be what is best for the organization at whole. What do our customers need and what do our business needs? And then it's the accountability candidly of this quite meaningful investment against business objectives and having a singularly responsible individual to care for that investment.\n\nLenny (00:50:46):\nIt sounds wonderful, having one person to deal with across all these functions.\n\nClaire Vo (00:50:50):\nIt is and isn't. I'll just say, I've done both. I've been a CPO next to an SVP of Eng. I've run both together. Founders can play this role. And again, this is why I say you have to optimize around talent in your organization. If your CEO has the skills, bandwidth, et cetera, to do this, they can do this. You can keep the organization separate. They can hold that. If they have a different area of expertise, if they've never done that before, if it's just not working operationally, they have broader areas of focus, then bring it together under someone. I don't think there's a perfect organization structure. This has just been one that's worked well in the shape of organizations that need someone like me.\n\nLenny (00:51:33):\nAnd along the same lines, designing an org around the person, I imagine there's not many very engineering background experience people that are also really good at product and can do design. I guess how deep do you need to be in each of these functions to be successful in this role? Because it feels really rare.\n\nClaire Vo (00:51:51):\nStart a company and then you have to do it, in some ways. I've worked for both and they've told me, I've worked for two, they go, \"I'm not a founder, but I'm the CEO.\" And I go, \"That's fine. I'm an operator, but I'm going to bring a founder mindset.\"\n\n(00:52:08):\nAnd so I think as a founder, especially early stage, you do all of this. You see how all of this is one person, because honestly sometimes it is one person, and sometimes that person is you. And so I do think working in a very small startup gives you the opportunity to experience a breadth of functional skills and develop a breadth of functional skills that can set you up for this kind of role much further down the line. I do think early stage startup experience is one of those shortcuts to getting visibility here.\n\n(00:52:46):\nI think the other thing is, again, I said this earlier, so many people get siloed into, \"I'm a product manager, and so my job is this, but it's not that. And I can only do this, and if designs are needed, I am blocked and I will just wait.\" And I just give permission for people to make... We have a leadership principle inside our team that's like, \"There are no lanes.\" Our lanes are dotted. They're not solid in that you can shift over and pencil out a design, an engineer can write a spec. All those things are fine. They're natural, they're normal, and I actually think they're quite healthy. And it's that kind of thinking that probably is going to breed the type of leaders that could do this type of role.\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\nAwesome. It reminds me at GitLab. I just interviewed their head of product, or CPO, and they have a core value of, \"Short toes.\" Don't worry about stepping on people's toes. Have short toes. Don't worry about people getting into your stuff. It's all good.\n\nClaire Vo (00:53:43):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:53:43):\nOkay. You mentioned AI. Amazing segue to my next topic that I want to spend some time on. You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there, other than some big company's tool like, I don't know, Sprague or Figma or something like that. First of all, just what is ChatPRD, and then why did you build it?\n\nClaire Vo (00:54:06):\nYeah. ChatPRD comes out of, again, pace setting. And I'll actually tell you the real genesis of ChatPRD, which is at a previous company we had a quite technical product we needed to build. We're scrappy and resource-constrained, and our platform PMs were working on something very important, but this was critical and we needed to get it done. And we didn't really have a platform technical PM to spec this thing out. And it was quite complicated.\n\n(00:54:35):\nAnd I raised my hand and I said, \"I'll IC this. I think I know what we need.\" And between the beginning of the meeting and the end of the meeting, I had used ChatGPT and a prompt to come up with a very serviceable PRD spec for this very technical product. And I took that prompt and that long-running ChatGPT thread and crafted the Claire version of a product leader or product person that could, with really solid consistency, output product specs, give good feedback, build out plans, build out tracking mechanisms and goals.\n\n(00:55:20):\nAnd so while I say, \"She may just be a prompt, but she is prompt,\" this was lovingly crafted over several months. And so when the GPT Store came out, for my team I just said, \"Hey, you all know I've been writing PRDs with ChatGPT.\" I created a GPT and just gave it to my team. I was like, \"Here, you can use this if you want it.\" And they really liked it, and other people started asking about it and I eventually ran into the monetization and access wall that is the GPT Store right now. And so I've also been having a lot of fun coding again, and so I thought, this is easy. We're just going to stand up a standalone app and wrap, come on, it's a wrapper, it started as wrapper, wrap some of these capabilities and just publish it and put a fairly reasonable price tag on it and see what happens.\n\n(00:56:12):\nAnd now, I have thousands of people using ChatPRD. Every day, people are creating dozens of specs and PRDs every month. It's everything from, \"I'm an engineer on a team with too few PMs and I get blocked, so I'm going to build my own requirements,\" to, \"I'm a solo founder and I need to put some structure on my thought for my team,\" to, \"I'm a PM and this has saved me truly hours of work to get the basics of my product requirements done so I can spend time on the details.\" And then I've added on more functions and capabilities than the standalone app. It is my personal product copilot that I've released for the world.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nOkay. First of all, where can people check this out? Is it chatprd.com?\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:53):\n.ai. Come on.\n\nLenny (00:56:54):\n.ai, of course.\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:54):\nYeah, chatprd.ai.\n\nLenny (00:56:58):\nI saw some stuff about the country that has .ai is just making so much bank right now.\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:01):\nSo much money.\n\nLenny (00:57:02):\nAll these domains.\n\n(00:57:04):\nThen in terms of the stack, just to be clear, so it started as a ChatGPT prompt, custom prompt, you evolved, then it became a GPT, a custom GPT, and now it's your own app that is using the OpenAI APIs behind-\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:17):\nIt is, yeah. It's using the assistance APIs. And what's different about the standalone app versus the GPT is every person that uses the standalone app gets a customized assistant. It learns from their specific content. It learns from their role. It learns from their company. If you use the GPT version, you're not getting that customization. When you use the standalone app, you are getting that customization. And then I've layered on a couple of different capabilities. In addition to having the chat format, it will actually create the document for you and iterate on the actual doc for you, and then working on some additional tools and integrations in the future.\n\nLenny (00:57:55):\nOkay, great. What are the most common use cases again? Just so people can get a sense of, \"Oh, let me use this for these things.\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:58:00):\nYeah, about 60% of people use it to put in an idea and get a PRD out. Just get the specs of what are my objectives and user goals, what are user stories, what is out of scope, walk through the UX. In our standard template, I have what's called a narrative, which is, how do you pitch this product? Which I feel like is a thing product managers miss a lot, which is how to position and pitch it, sequencing and milestones, measurements and goals, all those sorts of things.\n\n(00:58:33):\nNow, that's the out-of-the-box template. As I said, you can actually customize what your PRD template is in ChatPRD if you do something different or want something different for your company. About 60% of people are using it for that. 30% of people, I would say, are using it to put in a spec or a PRD or a strategy doc or a roadmap and improve it. And then the rest are using it to brainstorm ideas, internal PM work. How do I come up with a good agenda for X, Y, and Z? That kind of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:59:02):\nAmazing. Okay, so I wrote a post recently sharing a bunch of examples of how people are using different GPT specifically at work, and I think it's spurred a lot of people to experiment with this stuff. If there's one tip that you could share for someone that's trying to build a GPT or their own custom app using APIs, any advice?\n\nClaire Vo (00:59:24):\nPrompt matters. We went through this whole cycle of prompt engineering is a thing, it's not really a thing, fine-tuning is... Prompt really does matter, and a good PM, I do competitive analysis. I use the same input and look at different GPT or ChatGPT. I look at the GPT Store version, I look at other PM tools that do this and I look at mine. I think mine is actually better.\n\n(00:59:50):\nAnd then I'm getting into a mode now where I may do some model experimentation and tuning behind the scenes, so it might not be OpenAI, it may be other things, but it matters. The instructions matter, the context matters for the quality of the output is something that I would say when building these kinds of products. I think the other thing is there is no solution right now for monetization. Knock on wood, open it and we'll figure it out. If I had more time, maybe I would create a platform out of what I've created for ChatGPT to let other people monetize their GPTs and add on capabilities. But it's not out of the box yet for folks. There's a lot of work that I had to do to get it from here to there.\n\nLenny (01:00:31):\nAre you making real money with this thing? And is it an idea that this becomes the thing you do someday maybe long term?\n\nClaire Vo (01:00:38):\nMy original goal, and I said this out on X, my original goal is I just want to buy a nice glass of wine a week. That was my goal. I could buy cases of wine now. This is very exciting for me. It's making what I would consider real money. Is it a venture scale thing? No. Does it need to be? No. I have a goal around my kids' education expenses. I would love for this to cover a little bit. I have a ambitious but not audacious goal for ChatPRD.\n\n(01:01:13):\nThe other goal that I have, which is, let's put monetization aside, is this is my joy space, zone of genius joy space. And my goal with ChatPRD is it has to be a hundred percent fun for me. This is my hobby, so I'm not doing anything that makes it not fun. It is a pure bliss space for me. I get to code on the weekends, I get to do customer support at night, and I get to build things that I would use. I get to learn new technologies. I want to keep it in that space because it provides a lot of joy for me. Put money aside, I just want it to be fun.\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\nLove that. Okay, so some people listening to this, especially PMs, may be like, \"Claire, what the hell are you doing? Are you going to replace product managers in a year or two?\" This connects to something I've just generally been thinking about and that's come up a bunch, is just over time, which skills and jobs of a product manager will be greatly enhanced by AI and which will be completely replaced by AI, if any, so that people can understand which skills they should be investing in and which maybe are less important.\n\n(01:02:22):\nI guess just broadly, do you have a sense of just here's skills that are going to continue to be incredibly important and AI will not take these skills and jobs off your plate? Versus, these are going to be the less important, AI will do these?\n\nClaire Vo (01:02:36):\nAt the highest level, I tend to be very short-term pessimistic, although I'll frame that short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. I am a big believer that technology has made society generally much more affluent, wealthier, happier, healthier. I am a big believer in technology and I am optimistic about its impact on the human race. There are lots of things that are not going well, but I really do believe that innovation and technology, I'm excited for my kid's future. I'm not afraid of it.\n\n(01:03:11):\nNow, that being said, I am of the mind excitedly that this is going to change stuff in companies incredibly quickly. And part of building ChatPRD is I hold myself to the bar as a technology leader, I need to be leading the league on understanding what this can disrupt, using these tools to make a better team, and actually shifting the size and shape of my organization in response to the technology around us. Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the ratios between PMs and other teams going to shift over time? Yes. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably. I think there's a lot of change coming and I want to be prepared for it.\n\n(01:04:00):\nNow, what do I think this replaces and what does it not replace? I was reflecting on this question and communication, lowercase C, I feel like is one of the places that's going to be replaced. And I call it lowercase C. It's the functional trading of information that allows other people to do jobs. I think that these language models and these tools are really good synthesizing information, putting together communication, and can coordinate who that communication goes to and get it out in many modalities of content.\n\n(01:04:41):\nAnd so I'm really thinking about the PM as the keeper of cross-functional relationships and communication is really, I think, potentially going to change. Now, but capital C communication of are you influential? Are you convincing? Are you bold? Can you get this system of humans to follow you down a path? That's, I think, going to be much harder to replace, and so I'm thinking about the edges of communication and where they'll change and what they won't.\n\nLenny (01:05:15):\nThat's really interesting. I did a little poll on Twitter asking people of between communication, execution, strategy, and product sense, which skills are most likely to be basically taken over by AI. And communication was number one, by far. I have a contrarian perspective. And strategy was the least voted. I feel like, so strategy work is essentially, \"Here's everything we know about the world and competitors and the market and our advantages. Here's a plan to win in the market essentially.\" I feel like that's what AI is incredibly good at.\n\nClaire Vo (01:05:49):\nI agree with you. I totally agree with you. I think, and again this comes to synthesis, good decision-making, and communication, if you can synthesize, distill it into a plan and communicate that plan, I found these tools exceptional. Use ChatPRD and give it a try.\n\n(01:06:09):\nNow, I think it's the human aspect though of boldness, seeing the future in a way that a thing trained on priors cannot. Those things I still think, and then charisma and attracting all those things to actually make the thing happen are pretty hard to replicate, which is why I love using ChatPRD. I'm not going to come up with the most genius way to do data export for Snowflake for some... That is a solved area that we should just scaffold up. I should customize it to what we do, and then we should ship it. That is not a place where my magic skills as a human are going to impact.\n\n(01:06:54):\nBut I don't think a lot of PMs see it that way. I think there's this real identity shift that's going to happen where PMs think that their value is coming from their ideas that they manifest into the world and how they individually manifest them. And I think we're going to shift to, are you building the right stuff? Are you building it quickly? And is it delivering? No matter what the tool chain is.\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\nYeah. I think your point about getting buy-in and getting everyone aligned, I don't know how an AI bot does that unless everybody's got their own little bot and they're all talking to each other.\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:29):\nThey all just get along.\n\nLenny (01:07:30):\nWe're in. I'll [inaudible 01:07:32] this a little higher.\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\nI actually made this list. I feel like this could be the entire podcast, but I made it a quick list of, \"Here's the jobs of a PM.\" And it's interesting. I don't know if this is really a question, but it's just interesting to think about which of these will some ChatPRD maybe do in the future. What does the job feel? You're writing PRDS, you're setting goals, proposing a roadmap, aligning a team behind a roadmap, developing a strategy, developing a vision, communicating timelines, finding blockers, and unblocking people, getting buy-in from up on high, getting budget resources for your team, giving feedback on product and design. Those are just some of the day-to-day jobs. I'm so curious just which of these AI can actually just do and not have to worry about it.\n\nClaire Vo (01:08:17):\nI think a lot of them AI can do. And so the question is, which of them do you want to hand the keys to an AI tool? And which of them are going to be much more valuable as a tool that an individual or a team's intellect can use to do a better, faster, higher impact job?\n\n(01:08:38):\nAgain, I believe in technology and I think this stuff, what's interesting about this moment right now is every week I see something that I would not have in a million years thought was possible three years ago. Every week, something new comes out where it just changes my mind of what's possible. I believe all of those are 80% good functionally tractable. The question is, is 80% good functionally tractable the best way to do that? Or can we take a certain type of person with a certain skill set backed by a purpose-built toolkit and make it 3X better, 4X better, 10X better? I think that's the more interesting question.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\nI think on the point of amazing things are happening every day, we had SpaceX launched the Starship and it was barely mentioned anywhere. We have the spaceship that could take us to Mars and, \"Meh, we don't need to talk about that.\"\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:31):\nWe get the kids up and stream it on YouTube.\n\nLenny (01:09:32):\nOh, that's awesome.\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:33):\nIt's magic. We live in this magic time. I think it's so fascinating. But I agree, we're getting spoiled by innovation.\n\nLenny (01:09:41):\nYou said that there's this ratio that might shift with product managers, engineers. I'm curious which ratio, because engineers are also getting more efficient, and so it's interesting if the ratios will be consistent as engineers become more efficient, PMs get it more efficient.\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:53):\nI wonder if whole roles get eliminated and replaced, and then ratios aren't even the right way to think about things. There's the ratio of this PM role to this many, one PM to seven to 10 engineers or one EM to... There's those ratios.\n\n(01:10:12):\nI also think there's going to be this interesting shift of as a manager, as a leader, how you allocate budget against tools and people I also think is going to shift. And I saw something where somebody said that every role that they got asked to open, the team had to spend a week trying to automate it before they were allowed to open the JD. It's just this very interesting... In my mind people, think that's scary and it's going to reduce jobs. Yes, and I do think there's also potentially other jobs that open up that can become very interesting.\n\n(01:10:45):\nAnd so I don't know how it's going to pencil out. I really don't. What I do know is things are going to change and I, as a leader and a person that cares for people's long-term careers, want to be much more forward-thinking than close my eyes to what the possible maybe dramatic changes are in our industry. I'm thinking about it, I'm experimenting with things, and I'm hoping that in our team in LaunchDarkly we're leading from the front here as opposed to on our back foot.\n\nLenny (01:11:17):\nI'm thinking many people listening here are like, \"Okay, I need to get on top of this. I need to stay ahead. I want to follow Claire's lead.\" Is your advice simply create GPTs, play with ChatGPT? Is there anything else there to help people?\n\nClaire Vo (01:11:29):\nI also think PMs need to be thinking about building product skills particularly around these non-deterministic products. It's been [inaudible 01:11:40]. Part of why I built ChatPRD is not just to stress test how these sorts of things are going to change the product function. It's literally, this is a new type of product built by a new type of technology and it's moving very fast. And learning how to build these kinds of products, if you can do that, I just think back to when mobile happened, if you're a PM that jumped on mobile, you had the pick of the litter when it came to jobs in very interesting startups.\n\n(01:12:11):\nAnd so I think we're in the same moment here where, if you can ratchet down and specialize and learn a new technology, you actually can get into very interesting positions. Those are both of my motivations on ChatPRD, is understand how it impacts the function that I lead, but also understand how to build a great product with these underlying technologies that are just much different than the technologies that I personally built on before.\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\nAnd so for someone, let's say, not super engineering-oriented, I guess how do you recommend people on your team explore this sort of thing? Is it [inaudible 01:12:46]?\n\nClaire Vo (01:12:45):\nYeah. I do think studying products that are out there is quite interesting. I love this idea of doing outside-in product tear-downs. What is good about this? What is bad about this? How would I have written the PRD here? What would I be measuring? How would I think about error states? How would I think about if this is a great product, a good product, or an okay product? I do think doing that sort of crit on an external product can be a really accessible way to start to stress test your own skills around this and figure out where there are gaps.\n\n(01:13:20):\nThat's one thing I think you can do. Two, I think there's a lot of no-code, low-code stuff you can play with. Even if you can't put your hands on keyboard and write code, you can certainly stitch together things and try some no-code tools. That's another way to do it. The other thing is find where it's fun. I think how fun is Midjourney? How fun are some of these more creative tools? And so find where there's something fun and build art out of it as a mechanism for learning. It doesn't always have to be commercially driven. It doesn't have to be part of work. It can just be find a space that you're personally interested in and play with what's out there.\n\nLenny (01:14:00):\nAwesome. One last question about ChatPRD. With Copilot, there's all these stats. It's making engineers 50% more efficient, whatever percentage. Do you have any sense of efficiency gains so far with ChatPRD?\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:14):\nI have qualitative feedback from product managers who have used ChatPRD, who have said, \"This has saved me dozens of hours I would've spent on writing documents.\" And another person said, \"I am a single PM on a team that's growing and I don't think we're going to have to hire another PM now.\" There's the people, there's both the individual aspect and the hours aspect, which is it's helping individuals PMs get higher leverage across a broad engineering or building team, and that it's helping them spend their time more effectively.\n\nLenny (01:14:57):\nMany people don't want to hear that they don't need to hire a PM. There's many people looking for jobs right now.\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:59):\nIt's true, but we can't... I think we saw this in the last couple of years. Inefficiently hiring and building unsustainable costs into a company leads no one to success. And if that's a lesson that I can teach anybody, it's sustainability in organizations is the responsibility of a leader. Yes, I would love to give everybody positions. There are not positions to have. And the best I can do for the people in the team is be really responsible and really thoughtful about that because that helps me grow their careers and helps me sustain their careers long-term.\n\n(01:15:41):\nIt's incredibly complicated, but also on the flip side, this is a very small startup. They can't afford another PM and they're extending their runway to build something transformational by not growing the team. And so, yes, people [inaudible 01:15:57] their teams and have these jobs and startups can't afford it, and they still have great things to do in the world.\n\nLenny (01:16:04):\nGreat answer. To start to wrap up our conversation, I have these two segments, Failure Corner and Contrarian Corner, and we can pick which corner you want to head to. Would you like to share a story of your career where you failed and something you learned from that? Or something you believe that most people don't believe? Which corner sounds more interesting?\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:24):\nI'll take Contrarian Corner.\n\nLenny (01:16:26):\nLet's go for there.\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:27):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:16:28):\nI need some sound effects for these corners. Do share.\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:33):\nI'm sharing this because you just released your podcast with Marty again. And I'm a sales-led product apologist unabashedly, which is, I think that it is okay to listen to the market and to be commercially oriented in products in ways that probably would make some folks in some types of product organizations squirm a little bit. And the reason why I believe this is I think there are tremendous businesses built on sales-led motions. And I disagree with the fact that that means you do not care for the craft or the experience of users. I think it can be the best of both worlds.\n\n(01:17:19):\nI love sales. I say if I was not in this role, put me on a quota and make me enterprise West. I love to sell, but I think product teams, this opposition we have industry-wide with sales-led I'm not convinced is healthy in every organization. And I was listening to the podcast and I think you all were talking about, you said, \"SAP is like this. And who wants to be SAP?\" Man alive. There are a lot of companies out there that would love to be SAP, now with a better product, with better experience, with more love from the industry maybe. But what a powerhouse company. And I think we as PMs turn our nose up to powerhouse companies too often because we want companies to be product-led, not sales-led.\n\nLenny (01:18:07):\nAmazing. I'm going to not go deeper into this topic because I don't want to be speaking on behalf of Marty's perspective, but there's so much debate that came out of that episode and I love that it trickles to more opinions being shared about ways product can work.\n\n(01:18:20):\nI guess, just to understand your takeaway here, is sales-led companies can be awesome. They can build amazing businesses, and it can be great to be a PM at a company like that.\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:27):\nYeah, and they can build great products.\n\nLenny (01:18:30):\nGreat. Claire, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:39):\nI will say, because we've been talking a lot about AI and replacing PMs, I love to sell. I love to help people get jobs, so if there are ways that I can help people find great fit companies, it's one of the things that I get a lot of energy out of. I just want to say that in the world. It's something that sparks a lot of joy. I get a lot of it inbound, \"Can you help me get in here? Can you help me get there?\" But if there is a tractable way that I can help you get to a connected to a company or a role that you think is great for you, that's fun for me and I'm totally open to it.\n\nLenny (01:19:09):\nHow would people reach out to you to try to help you get them [inaudible 01:19:13]?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:15):\nI am, of course, on LinkedIn. I'm on X at ClaireVo, all one word. And then if you really want to go into the archives, I have a very fabulous TikTok where I'm ChiefProductOfficer. It's all one word.\n\nLenny (01:19:27):\nAmazing. We'll link to all these in the show notes. And we will refresh these two facts at the end of the podcast anyway, because I always ask this anyway. Before we do that, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:28):\nI am so ready.\n\nLenny (01:19:41):\nOkay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:46):\nHigh Growth Handbook I love, and I like Scaling People. These are two books that the reason why I recommend them to people is because they have solid playbook answers to 80%, 90% of everyday leadership scaling people questions. And so they're just great reference books for what I think great leadership inside startups can look like, and they solve some of the things that you don't need to solve novel-ly. And then one on the fiction side that I've been recommending is Circe, which is a retelling of Circe's story from her perspective. It's a great read, and everybody I've recommended it to really loves it.\n\nLenny (01:20:28):\nFrom Game of Thrones?\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:31):\nNo, Circe from the Odyssey. Odysseus [inaudible 01:20:34]. She turns men into pigs.\n\nLenny (01:20:36):\n[inaudible 01:20:36] lack of culture.\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:37):\nIt's great. My kids are very into Greek mythology, so this is me meeting them on my side.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nAmazing. The first two books are both Straight Press. Shout out to Straight Press.\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:46):\nYeah, Straight Press.\n\nLenny (01:20:47):\nAnd I have both books in the back there, and my laptop's actually sitting on Scaling People.\n\n(01:20:52):\nNext question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:57):\nI have kids, so I don't get to go see movies. Movies are, that's an adventure. It's basically a vacation. I saw Poor Things, which if you like capital W weird capital A art, highly recommend Poor Things. The show that I recommend to people, I love Mythic Quest. Everybody references Silicon Valley, but Mythic Quest gets at some of, I was in gaming once, gets at some of my experiences in the technology organizations. It's got a technical female lead and think it's quite funny. I like Mythic Quest.\n\nLenny (01:21:31):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:31):\nI like to ask candidates how they would improve our business model. I think so many PMs come in with a point of view of the product and the target market but don't actually understand the underlying mechanisms of how we make money and what our unit economics are and how that could be improved. And the candidates that do come in and have a strong point of view on business model often are pretty successful in our organization.\n\nLenny (01:21:55):\nAnd what do you look for in a good answer that's, \"Oh wow, this candidate's great?\"\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:59):\nIt's thinking along the chain of value from how do we identify people in the market? What does our pricing model look like? What could they hypothesize our underlying unit economics or cogs are? And then where are their points of leverage along that whole funnel? It's really, do they have a mental model for thinking about a business model? Have they thought at all about how we make money, either top line or margin? And then can they identify places where they might improve it?\n\nLenny (01:22:28):\nAwesome. Basically understanding the business really well. Great.\n\n(01:22:30):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:36):\nOkay, I'm going to make you laugh because you've gotten all these cars, right?\n\nLenny (01:22:40):\nYeah, I have such expensive cars.\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:42):\nYou've got expensive cars. It's not new, I love my minivan. I am a big fan of my minivan. As my friend says, \"It's like driving around your living room.\" And when you have two kids, you know what I want to do? I just want to drive around my living room, Bluey included. And so no Rivian, no Mercedes-Benz, but I really love my Pacifica.\n\nLenny (01:23:06):\nPacifica? Okay, I was going to ask.\n\nClaire Vo (01:23:07):\nBut the actual car product that I really love, I love Waymo. We're in San Francisco, we've got these autonomous vehicles. It is, top to bottom, just a lovely product experience from the app to when it shows up, the sound design is great, the cars are comfortable, the displays in the car are great. It is, now every time a tourist comes in, a friend comes in to visit San Francisco, I make them take a round-trip ride in a robot car. And then even I've had a customer service experience with the Waymo team where my friend left an iPhone and [inaudible 01:23:44] and customer experience was great, 24-hour service. Top to bottom, great product design, great service design.\n\nLenny (01:23:53):\nI just got into Waymo actually in the wait list, and so I'm excited to actually try it. I was actually treated as press early on to ride in a Waymo with a person from the company, just to experience it. And then I never got access to it after. Now, I finally can try it.\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:08):\nEnjoy. It's so nice. It's my preferred mode of travel.\n\nLenny (01:24:12):\nThe future. We've talked about a lot of ways the world is changing. That's another great example.\n\n(01:24:18):\nTwo questions to go. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family they find useful in work or in life?\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:26):\nFast beats right. Every time when debating between, do I noodle this for a thousand years and try to come to the perfect solution or do I make a decision and get executing and direction I have conviction on, I consistently see and believe that fast at the end of the day, wins. Fast beats right.\n\nLenny (01:24:51):\nFinal question. You mentioned TikTok. You put a bunch of awesome content out on TikTok. Any advice, slash is there a tip you could share with someone that is trying to be successful on TikTok from your experience?\n\nClaire Vo (01:25:03):\nI've been neglecting my TikTok for a little bit with new job and winter with sick kids. This is my advice, and I think you know this, consistency drives audience growth, which is, when I was on TikTok posting every day, you would get followers and engagement and the algorithm would bless you. And when you don't, you don't. I think consistency in almost all things wins.\n\n(01:25:27):\nThe other thing that I think is a really good advice for any quote-unquote creator of whatever scale, of whatever ambition, is I think thinking about content creation as documentation, not creative generation is really helpful. I just like to talk about what I think about at work and I like to, an interesting meeting or interesting interaction, document why I thought that was interesting or what could be done better. And that becomes the basis of a very natural flow of content for me. It's a tactic that's worked really well for me and helps me do stuff in my free time.\n\nLenny (01:26:00):\nAmazing. It might be time to start exploring Instagram also with all this TikTok news.\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:05):\nI know. Yep.\n\nLenny (01:26:06):\nClaire, before we started this podcast, I asked you what your goal for this was, and it was to be helpful to people. I think we've 100% done that in so many different ways. Thank you again so much for being here.\n\n(01:26:16):\nTwo final questions. We already covered these, but just to refresh people's memories, where can people find you online if they want to reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:24):\nLinkedIn, X, I'm ClaireVo, all one word. And then on TikTok, get me back into it. Give me a follow, maybe I'll start posting some of my excellent content. But it's @ChiefProductOfficer.\n\nLenny (01:26:37):\nAwesome. And then how can people be useful to you?\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:41):\nHelp each other. That's what I want the most, which is I do really see, it is a tough time in tech right now and there are a lot of people looking for jobs. One, I think help each other. And then the other thing that I really, if I could ask your audience anything, is if you have a job where your job is typing into an internet box to create products out of nothing, really acknowledge the privilege and joy of that job and try to have some fun because a lot of people want to sit where you're sitting.

  "zh": "Claire Vo (00:00:00):\n人们通常认为我被后期阶段的公司聘用，是因为我应该教他们如何像大公司一样运作。但事实上，我说我被聘用是为了提醒他们，他们可以像初创公司一样运作。\n\nLenny (00:00:11):\n每个人都想要这样。每个人都会说：“是的，速度要快，质量要精。” 对你来说，这方面有什么例子吗？\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:16):\n我会向我的领导层传达，我的预期是他们将执行节奏 (Clock speed，指公司或团队的反应和执行速度) 提升一个档次。如果你认为某件事今年需要完成，那么它就需要在今年上半年完成。\n\nLenny (00:00:24):\n这里可能出现了一个趋势，就是将工程和产品部门结合起来。\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:27):\n我用 CPTO (Chief Product and Technology Officer，首席产品技术官) 作为同时管理产品、工程和设计职能的缩写。不应该存在关于什么对产品最好、什么对工程最好、或者什么对设计速度最好的争论。什么才是对整个组织最好的？\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\n你构建了一个名为 ChatPRD 的工具。我猜它是目前最受欢迎的专门针对 PM (Product Manager，产品经理) 的 AI 工具。\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:44):\n它会在明年淘汰 PM 吗？可能不会。所需的技能会发生转变吗？是的。这种转变会比我们预想的快得多吗？很有可能。\n\nLenny (00:00:56):\n今天，我的嘉宾是 Claire Vo。Claire 长期担任 Color、Optimizely 以及目前 LaunchDarkly 的首席产品官 (CPO)。她还曾两次创业，担任过工程师、设计师和市场营销人员。她还是 ChatPRD 的创建者，我怀疑这是目前使用最广泛的 PM 专用 AI 产品，这是她在晚上和周末业余时间开发的。\n\n(00:01:19):\n在我们的对话中，我们深入探讨了 AI 将补充以及未来可能取代哪些 PM 技能、ChatPRD 背后的故事，以及 Claire 对于如何在 PM 角色中保持 AI 领先地位的建议。我们还讨论了对职业生涯拥有掌控感 (Agency) 的重要性，以及如何改变命运的轨迹来实现你想实现的目标。此外，还有关于如何成为一名成功的女性科技高管的见解，她如何在保持高标准的同时在大公司创造快速的节奏，CPTO 职位的兴起（将产品和工程整合在一位领导者之下），以及大量针对职场新人及高级领导者的职业建议等等。\n\n(00:02:01):\n这一集内容适合任何从事产品工作或对产品角色感兴趣的人，我非常高兴能把它带给大家。如果你喜欢这个播客，别忘了在你最喜欢的播客应用或 YouTube 上订阅和关注。这是避免错过未来节目的最好方式，也对本播客有很大帮助。下面，在听完赞助商的简短介绍后，我们将迎来 Claire

(00:04:32):\n这是一种荣幸和快乐，我很高兴能来到这里。你的嘉宾和内容给我留下了深刻的印象。看到这个领域如此广泛的产品领导者和思想家，真是令人兴奋。如果我能进入这个领域的产品领导者和思想家名单，那说明我做得还不错。谢谢你的邀请。\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\n这是我的荣幸。\n\n(00:04:53):\n我想先从谈论职业建议开始。我浏览了你的 LinkedIn，你的职业路径基本上是大多数 PM 梦寐以求的。简单总结一下，你从助理产品经理 (APM) 到产品经理，到高级产品经理，到总监，到高级总监，到副总裁 (VP)，到高级副总裁 (SVP)，再到首席产品官 (CPO)，现在你已经担任过三家不同公司的 CPO。在此过程中，你还是创始人、设计师和工程师。\n\n(00:05:22):\n我的问题是：如果你必须总结一下，你认为你在 PM 职业生涯中走得如此之远、如此之快的“秘诀 (Secret sauce)”是什么？\n\nClaire Vo (00:05:33):\n是的，当你把这些列出来时，你大概能猜到，这背后核心是一个有着强烈好奇心、缺乏耐心、渴望构建的人。我只是喜欢构建东西，我觉得这很有趣。我认为如果你能找到一个有趣的职业或手艺，就很容易在这个职业中加速成长。第一点就是，我热爱我所做的事情。\n\n(00:05:56):\n但说到职业成长和晋升，从——我实际上是从文案 (Copywriter) 起步的，从文案一直到管理工程组织的 CPO 或 CPTO——这可以归结为非常简单的几点：知道你从职业生涯中想要什么，明确表达并要求它，然后让你的老板或任何能支持或提拔你的人，能轻松地把你从当前位置推向目标位置。\n\n(00:06:20):\n我举一个我职业生涯早期的具体例子。当时我负责设计和产品管理，在一家电子商务公司担任产品和设计的高级经理级别，并与增长和营销部门密切合作。我们就像一枚硬币的两面，合作非常紧密。后来营销主管离职了，公司很快就出现了一个大难题：“好吧，营销部门该怎么办？我们需要招人吗？”\n\n(00:06:49):\n我坐了大约半天时间思考，我觉得我可以帮上忙。我画了一张组织结构图，把我的名字放在顶端，走进我老板的办公室说：“这是解决你营销组织问题的一个潜在方案，我们将产品和营销增长整合在一起。我可以担任这个职位。以下是我将如何改变底下的管理结构——不仅是把我放在哪里，还有把其他人放在哪里。我认为这对公司行得通，这是我建议的推行方式，这也是我的职位描述 (JD)。” 后来我得到了那份工作。我想当人们向我咨询职业建议时，他们想听到的是“我能做什么？”。但实际上，你想要什么？以及你如何尽可能简单地向老板陈述理由，让你从这里到达那里？\n\n(00:07:33):\n我给人们的另一个建议是：清楚你从当前职位中想要什么，并且确切地知道你的下一个职位想要什么。我甚至清楚这一点，并对我老板直言不讳。当我在 Optimizely 担任产品副总裁时，我对老板说：“我想成为首席产品官。这是我将如何带公司达成目标的方法，我希望你能在这方面与我合作。” 甚至在面试 LaunchDarkly 的这个职位时，我的老板 Dan（LaunchDarkly 的 CEO）问我：“你从这个职位中想要什么？” 我说：“我希望我的下一个职位是 CEO，所以我希望这个职位能填补我的空白，让我学习，帮助提升我的经验，为下一步做好准备。”\n\n(00:08:14):\n所以我总是知道下一个职位是什么，并且对此非常明确。当然，我认为这里有一个微妙的平衡。明确目标是一回事，但如果只谈论晋升而让周围人感到窒息则是另一回事。在我与老板的互动中，关于职业成长和路径的讨论可能只占 0.005%。比例非常小。“我表达清楚了吗？我们达成共识了吗？在我朝着这些目标取得进展时，我是否进行了沟通？”\n\n(00:08:44):\n我认为高潜力 (High-slope，指成长曲线陡峭) 的人，只要组织能够支持，其晋升速度几乎是飞快的。我几乎从未后悔没能早点提拔某人，但我见过经理或其他人提拔得稍微有点太快了。因此，作为一个管理自己职业生涯的人，你必须平衡好野心与决断力，照顾好自己并为自己争取，但归根结底，工作表现必须过硬 (Work needs to speak for itself)，这才是驱动你职业成长的动力。所以，知道你想要什么，但要付诸行动并产出结果，你就能拥有像我一样的职业生涯。\n\nLenny (00:09:24):\n也许先总结一下，你分享的一些核心建议是：清楚你到底想要什么，因为如果你不知道要去哪里，你就无法朝着那个精彩的未来职业进发。否则，你会被推向你未必感兴趣的方向。\n\n(00:09:38):\n我明白你要表达的意思，就是告诉别人并提出要求。“这就是我未来想做的事情，帮我实现它。” 我也很喜欢你提到的另一点：不要过度关注这一点。很多人把大量的精力花在“我需要晋升、我如何达到下一个级别、我配得上更高的级别”。沿着这个思路，你还有什么建议可以分享，比如如何避免成为那种时刻痴迷于晋升的人？关于如何找到这种平衡，还有什么建议吗？\n\nClaire Vo (00:10:06):\n首先，你必须锁定你所在组织的规范，即人才选拔规范。你应该了解这些是如何运作的，如果你在一家非常小的初创公司，它们可能运作得很随意；如果你在一家大公司，它们可能运作得更正式。了解组织内部晋升在操作上是如何发生的，可以帮助你在正确的时间、正确的场景和背景下进行对话。这是我的建议之一。我们是一家规模稍大的组织，我们有晋升周期，有特定的提拔时间。所以，如果你在晋升周期前四个月找我谈，也许这在我脑海中占据首位，也许没有。在大型组织内部，有时我在职能上无法随时随地提拔人。\n\n(00:10:52):\n第一点，我认为是了解你团队的人才日历 (Talent Calendar，指公司评估和晋升人才的周期)，尤其是在大型组织中。第二点是，沟通的重点真正需要围绕“你身处不同的职位能为公司带来什么”以及“为什么公司需要这个职位”。通常人们的谈话内容是：“我想被晋升，因为我想成为产品经理总监 (Director of PM)，因为我想成为一名管理者，因为我需要带直接下属 (Direct reports)。” 而不是说：“看，你的管理幅度 (Span of control) 已经有九个直接下属了，你需要在这里增加杠杆 (Leverage，指通过授权或设立新层级来提高效率)。我在产品组织的这一块很有威信。我认为如果这个职位存在，我们可以做得更多。而且我认为我适合这个职位，因为我已经证明了 A、B 和 C。”\n\n(00:11:43):\n这是在为公司解决问题，而不是为个人解决职业成长问题。我认为想要晋升的人需要以这种导向来思考，而不是另一种。因为老实说，尤其是现在，比如（此处模糊 00:12:01）。不再仅仅是每 12 个月固定给予薪酬涨幅 (Comp increases) 和绩效调薪 (Merit increases) 然后你就能获得晋升。我们真的必须仔细思考团队的结构、规模和组织形式。产品团队天生就比较精简。\n\n(00:12:19):\n所以，管理、总监和高级总监的职位并不是随处都有的。如果你想进入管理层，例如，你必须证明你擅长组织设计 (Organization design)。我认为应真正关注为什么一个角色对公司有好处或对公司是必要的，以及为什么你是该角色的最佳人选，而不是仅仅表达“我想被晋升”。\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\n这真是太棒了，而且是非常重要的建议——关注你如何为你的经理和业务解决问题，而不是说：“嘿，这是我的职业生涯所需要的。这太糟糕了，我的职业发展停滞不前。” 我很喜欢这一点。我也非常喜欢你传达的关于“赋能” (Empowerment) 的信息。这不仅仅是说，你就在这个位置上，你对此无能为力。而是寻找机会去帮助你的经理，帮助你的业务。“这是我可以做的，来把事情推向更远的地方。”\n\n(00:13:06):\n而且我认为你触及到了一个时机的要素。在事情可能发生的时候提出建议。你分享了那个关于营销缺口 (Marketing gap) 的例子。\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:15):\n是的，没错。\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\n还有其他类似的例子吗？你展示了“这就是我能如何帮助组织”，从而帮助了另一次晋升？如果没有也没关系。\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:25):\n老实说，这就是我如何扩展到在技术组织中领导工程团队的。当时我在 Color，那时确实需要提升我们的工程组织水平，而我恰好知道该怎么做。我有高度的信心，认为自己具备技术和组织方面的技能，能够以对业务至关重要的方式扩展工程组织，无论从架构 (Architecture) 角度还是从团队和人才角度来看。所以那是另一个我知道有问题需要解决的情况。我知道那个问题很重要，我知道我们必须快速解决它，而且我有信心我知道自己能做到。我有信心我能在那里提供帮助。\n\n(00:14:06):\n所以我至今仍在做这些工作。在 Color，我最初是负责产品的。我很快就开始领导工程组织，这非常棒，然后我还接管了一些非临床运营工作，那时我们有一个非常偏运营的领导者。我们有一些大规模的挑战需要处理，这符合我的才能组合，而且我知道我可以很快帮助到公司。\n\n(00:14:32):\n这是我可能会给产品经理 (PM) 的另一个建议。PM 是一个如此通才 (Generalist) 的角色，为了向上发展，往左或往右跨出一点是可以的。我接受了这个营销增长 (Marketing growth) 的角色，那实际上是我的第一个总监角色。它不仅针对产品，也针对营销。我必须学习营销并培养那里的技能，但那是我可以建立更广泛领导力职业生涯的基础。所以，我也确实认为，将目光投向产品范畴之外的左右两侧，是寻找成长机会的一种非常有效的方式。\n\nLenny (00:15:08):\n我喜欢这个建议，它会带来许多意想不到的机会。关于 PM 的一个大问题是——回到你最初的建议“知道你想去哪里”——PM 可以发展的方向太多了。你最终可以成为创始人 (Founder)、总经理 (GM)、首席官 (CO，如 COO 等) 或其他身份。尝试这类事情通常能帮助你理解：“这才是真正让我兴奋的事情。也许我想转向设计。”\n\nClaire Vo (00:15:31):\n是的，还有一件事我认为人们并不理解，也许我作为创始人经历过这一点，而且我在公司内部也深有感触，那就是：世界是可以根据你的意志而改变的 (The universe is bendable to your will)。我的意思是，在大多数——至少在我运作的初创阶段、成长阶段公司和后期创业公司 (Late stage startups) 中——组织是非常流动的，而我喜欢围绕有才华、有动力的人进行组织。\n\n(00:15:58):\n因此，仅仅因为我们现在是以特定方式组织的，仅仅因为这些组织是分开的或在一起的，并不意味着它们必须一直是那样。所以你应该考虑自己在组织现有结构中的职业成长。但作为一名组织设计思想家 (Org design thinker)——这是我必须要做的一项非常重要的工作——你还必须将这个系统视为一个活生生的、有呼吸的实体，它可以随着时间的推移而转变，特别是围绕着高动力、高才华的人。\n\nLenny (00:16:30):\n顺着同样的思路，参考你已经分享的建议，即从“我的经理和上级正在挣扎于什么”的角度出发，以及我该如何提议：“这是一个解决方案，恰好也能让我进入一个更有趣的角色？”\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:46):\n对，没错。\n\nLenny (00:16:48):\n有一个方向我原本没打算谈，但我认为非常重要且有趣，那就是像你这样非常出色且成功的人，最终会承担很多工作，而那往往最后并不是他们想要的。\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:58):\nSOS (救命)。\n\nLenny (00:17:00):\n没错。关于那句经典的建议“小心你所擅长的事 (Be careful what you're good at)”，你有什么看法吗？关于如何避免最终揽下所有事情，有什么建议吗？\n\nClaire Vo (00:17:08):\n我坚信要在你的“天才领域” (Zone of genius，指一个人最擅长且最有热情的事) 内工作。我坚信要发挥长处。如果你身处一个职位，你擅长某些事情并且被赋予了很多责任，但你有着巨大的待提升领域 (Growth edges)，并且你花在需要提升的事情上的时间比花在你卓越的事情上的时间还要多，我认为这对组织不公平，对你也不公平。\n\n(00:17:32):\n我深信定义并了解你的“天才领域”——即你表现卓越、没有人能像你一样出色地完成这项工作、并且你从中获得巨大智力和情感快乐的地方——才是使工作长期可持续的原因。所以，我实际上认为这与工作的量或广度无关。而与工作的可持续性 (Sustainability) 有关。你是否能每天精神饱满、全身心投入并对所做的事情感到兴奋？\n\n(00:18:04):\n我认为要非常有意识地观察你是否在那个空间运行。这可能会回到——我认为，我从未后悔过晋升某人太慢，但我后悔过晋升某人太快。在特定领域具有“高斜率” (High-slope，指成长速度极快) 的个人想要获得更多责任、想要更大的职权范围 (Scope)，我见过一些经验不足的经理、总监甚至和我同级别的人，想要给出的机会却把人放在了一个既没有效率也不快乐的位置。所以，我认为自我意识到这一点非常重要，作为一名经理，认识到这一点也同样重要。\n\n(00:18:50):\n个人而言，我确实做了很多，但我确实觉得我在自己的“天才领域”内。我也知道，留在个人天才领域的一部分是拥有这种广泛的责任，但同时保留“创造者时间” (Builder time)。我的意思是我必须有时间产出真正来自我个人的工作，这意味着日历管理 (Calendar management) 和时间管理非常重要。\n\nLenny (00:19:21):\n我们要聊聊你创造的一些东西。\n\n(00:19:23):\n关于寻找自己的“天才领域”，对于那些试图弄清楚自己的天才领域是什么的人，你有什么建议吗？我知道有一个关于如何专门思考天才领域的 TED 演讲（此处模糊 00:19:33）。\n\nClaire Vo (00:19:32):\n是的。我无法精确地转述，但我见过的一种策略是：回顾你过去一个月或一个季度的日历，把每件事都写下来，然后基本上把它们分组成：我讨厌做这个、我不喜欢做但还行、我喜欢做这个、以及我非常热爱做这个——如果我可以把所有时间都花在这上面，我会是世界上最幸福的人。字面上地把你花时间的方式归入这些类别，然后把底部的分类扔掉。只专注于顶部的分类并思考：“我该如何更多地处于这个状态？” 通常，这才是引导你找到热情、专业技能以及因为高度投入而能产生巨大价值的地方。\n\n(00:20:26):\n我认为另一件事是真正问自己——这也许回到了职业建议的角度——真正问自己：“我做的什么事情是这个组织中没有其他人能做的？” 我做的很多事情组织里的其他人也能做，但哪些事情是……就像你想一个差异化产品一样，是难以复制的？了解那是什么并以此为重，可以驱动非凡的职业成长，也能让你感到非常快乐。\n\nLenny (00:20:58):\n对你来说，那样的例子是什么？\n\nClaire Vo (00:21:00):\n我认为我其实非常擅长横向跨越以及上下贯通。我的意思是，我能游刃有余地穿梭于产品、工程、设计、数据和运营，说实话还有营收 (Revenue) 领域，而那些垂直领域或职能部门的领导者可能在这方面稍欠缺。我觉得我在广泛领域都有很高的熟练度 (Fluency)，可以轻松地将不同职能部门之间的对话围绕业务目标结合在一起。这就像是我的本能。我曾是创始人，这是我的第二天性。\n\n(00:21:31):\n另一件我认为我能做得很好且感到非常愉快的事，就是“穿梭海拔” (Traverse elevation)。没错，我喜欢站在这里思考战略和愿景，但也喜欢深入细节以推动事情进展。我认为这种横向运作，加上能在垂直方向上上下穿梭——无论那个垂直领域发生在哪里——都让我感到非常快乐。我觉得我在这方面做得挺不错。\n\nLenny (00:21:58):\n太棒了。我们实际上会触及你刚才提到的一些事情。不过很快提一下，你提到了基本上是“能量审计” (Energy audit) 的概念。实际上 Matt Mochary 有一个非常好的指南，我会把它放在节目笔记中，它会引导你如何进行这个操作。我们在这个播客中经常谈论这个，就是寻找能给你能量的事，多做那些；寻找消耗你能量的事，少做那些。当你有份工作，必须做别人付钱让你做的事时，这说起来容易做起来难，但即使仅仅是帮助你指向职业生涯长期发展的目标，它仍然非常有帮助。\n\n(00:22:29):\n**Lenny:** 好的，你提到过你是个创业者，而且感觉你骨子里也确实是个创业者，但你已经在大型公司工作有一段时间了。我听说你非常擅长在大型公司内部设定极快的 Pace（节奏），并保持那种初创公司的专注力，同时还能对质量和产品保持极高的标准。每个人都想要这个，大家都说：“是的，既要快，又要质量出众。” 谁会不想要呢？我很好奇，你具体在实践中是如何操作的，让你能够打造出既能快速行动又能保持高标准的团队？有哪些你觉得有帮助的流程、价值观或工作方式吗？\n\n**Claire Vo (00:23:06):**\n是的，这很有趣。人们通常认为我在后期公司（Later stage companies）被聘用是为了教他们如何像大公司一样运作。而事实上，我说我是被雇来提醒他们，他们仍然可以像 Startup（初创公司）那样运作的。所以我思考这个问题的方式完全不同。\n\n(00:23:23):\n关于 Pace（节奏）和 High Bar（高标准），我会思考两件事。从节奏上来说，要了解你的 Internal Pace（内部节奏），本质上不要让它退化到定期会议的节奏。我经常发现组织的节奏会被锁定在日历的节奏上，因此我会非常留心，不让 Recurring Meetings（定期例会）驱动下一步行动。这是一件非常具体的事，但当有人说“哦，我们会在下次会议上讨论或决定这个”时，我会说：“不，我们现在就该讨论。我们明天就该决定。”\n\n(00:23:58):\n我考虑的另一件事是在组织内部设定“快一个档位”的节奏预期。我加入一个组织后，不管别人喜不喜欢，这就是我的做法：如果我看到一个组织的运行 Pace（节奏）低于我的预期，我会告诉我的领导层，我的期望是他们把 Clock Speed（时钟频率，指组织运作速度）调快一个档位。这意味着如果你认为某件事今年需要完成，那么它就必须在这个半年内（this half）完成；如果你认为这半年要完成，那就得在这个季度完成；这个季度，就变成这个月；这个月，变成这周；这周，变成今天；今天，变成在这次会议结束前。实际上，设定一种预期，即你的自然节奏往往会比你的雄心要慢，并且明确地要求把进度提前，我认为这可以改变预期的设定方式，坦白说，也能改变组织的能量和势头。\n\n(00:24:51):\n关于节奏的第三点是个人 SLA（Service Level Agreement，服务等级协议）。我永远不想成为组织的 Bottleneck（瓶颈）。这是我这个职位最具挑战性的事情之一，因为你通常是决策、仲裁、下一步行动、审批和 Socialization（同步沟通）的节点。如果我个人的 SLA 很慢，那么我组织的其余部分就无法达到最快速度。我尽量做到快速响应。我尝试做到既保持极高的频率，又非常迅速。这很难，有时并不完全可能，但这是我的目标。\n\n**Lenny (00:25:27):**\n我非常喜欢这个 Clock Speed（时钟频率）的概念，就是让我们比通常的节奏快一个迭代。你具体是怎么做的？是你以身作则，然后大家效仿？还是团队的一项原则？你会使用某个特定的短语吗？\n\n**Claire Vo (00:25:41):**\n是的，这是我常用的一个短语，也是我要求领导团队去做的事情。它始于：第一，我会这样做；第二，我的期望是你们也要寻找这样做的机会。我认为这之所以有效，是因为它非常具体且具有操作性。这就像是，当你正要说出一个截止日期时，你会审视自己并想：“这合适吗？还是我需要把它提前一个迭代？” 所以这是我给领导团队的一个非常实操的建议和期望。如果他们能以这种方式表现，那么组织的预期 Pace（节奏）就会提升，然后大家往往会迎难而上。\n\n**Lenny (00:26:26):**\n这与你的第一个建议直接挂钩，即不依赖 Meeting Cadence（会议节奏）来决定 Action Cadence（行动节奏）。我猜也是类似的情况，你告诉大家：“这是我希望的运作方式”，然后你实际按此操作，接着这种方式就开始渗透。\n\n**Claire Vo (00:26:41):**\n是的，我认为存在一种 Anti-pattern（反模式），即“我们下次会议再做决定”，或者“我们下次会议再跟进”。那是 Google日历或你使用的任何日历引入的“人造时间线”。它不是真实的东西，所以我希望我们按照真实的时间线行事。我们什么时候能做决定？我们需要多少信息？这并不意味着每个决定都要在现在、今天或明天做出，但它确实意味着我们不要为了推动产品前进而去生搬硬套那些人造的 Cadences（节奏）。\n\n**Lenny (00:27:12):**\n太棒了。我们来谈谈 Quality（质量）。这方面有什么经验教训吗？\n\n**Claire Vo (00:27:17):**\n有的。我认为关于 High Bar（高标准），作为领导者我会考虑两件事：一是 Talent Bar（人才标准）要极高，二是 Product Bar（产品标准）要高。\n\n(00:27:28):\n我先从人才谈起。在人才方面，我认为你必须定义标准。你必须非常明确，这意味着你必须深入思考你的 Leadership Principles（领导力原则）是什么。如果你的领导力原则是“将 Clock Speed（时钟频率）提高一个迭代”，那就明确这就是你期望看到的，然后清晰表达出来，并让人们为此负责。\n\n(00:27:51):\n所以我认为建立一个具体且可衡量的 Career Ladder（职业晋升阶梯）非常重要，特别是在高级别职位上。我经常发现这些标准非常模糊。比如“聘用并管理多个部门”或“吸收跨职能利益相关者的反馈”。这些都不是可处理、具体的指标。因此，我认为 PM（产品经理）们应该拿出你们定义产品或 OKR（目标与关键结果）的劲头，为这些级别定义一些真实的目标，并且要足够具体，让你能看着员工断然说道：“是的，从衡量指标上看，他们达到了标准”，或者“不，他们没达到”。我认为这非常重要。\n\n(00:28:39):\n第二点是，你必须使反馈 Normalization（常态化）。我很喜欢同为德州人的 Brené Brown，她说“清晰即友善”（Clear is kind）。我认为回避冲突、回避反馈的文化会降低人才标准。事实就是这样，因为预期没有被说明，你也没有在追究责任。我不认为那是友善。那不是在成就别人的职业生涯，也不是在帮助他们成为最优秀的队友。\n\n(00:29:08):\n我非常喜欢让反馈常态化，正如我所说，在进行公开、坦诚的反馈时要“降温”（指去除负面情绪，客观对待）。这意味着当人们没有达到预期时要非常明确，并清晰地表明：质疑想法并不是在质疑天赋。我认为人们需要听到这些来让反馈变得常态化。我觉得反馈非常重要。\n\n(00:29:30):\n第三点是，不幸的是，当你致力于建立高 Talent Bar（人才标准）和高 Talent Density（人才密度）时，如果有人不合适，工作没起色，那么迅速采取行动也是工作的一部分。这是工作中困难的部分，也是大多数管理者真正回避的部分，但我认为这很重要，因为它能让你的整体团队以一种非常健康、有效、高性能的方式运作，这会让每个人都更快乐，包括那些在当时可能并不适合该角色工作的人。\n\n**Lenny (00:30:02):**\n有没有你对某人表现得异常坦诚，或者给出关于质量的硬核反馈的例子？那种让人觉得“哇，这才是该有的样子”的例子？\n\n**Claire Vo (00:30:16):**\n我组织里曾有两个领导者——我不说是谁，也不说是何时——他们是产品和工程部门的合作伙伴，但他们就是搞不到一块儿去。他们无法协作，在优先级和战略上存在分歧，无法沟通，甚至在团队面前发生冲突。\n\n(00:30:38):\n而管理他们的经理采取的是非常软弱（Soft pedal）的方法，比如“你需要加强跨职能沟通”，我还在等着看绩效管理（Performance management）的结果。于是我分别给他们打了电话，我说：“你们的运作方式不符合我们的领导力预期。如果你们不改变，你们就不能再待在这个组织里了。我相信你们可以换一种方式运作，我真的相信。” 事实上我也确实相信。我相信这些是非常有才华的人，他们有能力做好。“我相信你们可以做得不同，但做到这一点是你们的责任，我需要从明天开始看到改变。”\n\n(00:31:20):\n我希望他们成功。事实上，他们确实做到了。他们立刻清醒了，领会了意图，其中一人在接下来的六到九个月里，成为了我们团队中最具影响力和效率的经理之一。我认为，清晰地说出“你没有达到预期。如果你继续这样下去，你在这里是不会成功的。我相信你能做到，但这是你的责任”，这种对话既清晰又友善，坦白说，在大多数情况下都非常有效。\n\n**Lenny (00:31:55):**\n这是一个很棒的例子。正如你所说，清晰即友善。这让我想起曾来过节目的 Kim Scott 分享的关于 Bob 的故事。我不知道你是否记得那个故事，就是他们公司的一个人工作做得很烂，所有人都知道，最后他们不得不开除他。在开除他时，他只是说：“你们为什么不告诉我？为什么没有人告诉我大家都觉得我做得不好？”\n\n**Claire Vo (00:32:16):**\n我真诚地认为，说“你做得不好”比说“我觉得你可以在这方面或那方面改进”或者“我收到一些反馈说你可以做得更好……”要友善得多。后面那种说法并不友善，因为它没能帮助别人在你的组织或其他地方获得成功。\n\n**Lenny (00:32:36):**\n好，让我们换个方向。聊聊作为科技行业的女性（Woman in tech）。\n\n**Claire Vo (00:32:40):**\n噢，好的。\n\n**Lenny (00:32:41):**\n这类播客通常不太讨论这个话题。我知道你有很多想法。显然，你经历了很多，有很多体验。可能有很多故事你还没在其他地方分享过，所以我只是想给你个机会，分享一下你的经历、你的见闻，以及任何建议。\n\n**Claire Vo (00:32:58):**\n是的，我很乐意谈谈。我知道很多人不想被定义为“C级高管层（C-level）中的女性或母亲”，或者总是被问及此类话题。我们也别再搞什么“科技女性座谈会”了。但我最近确实在反思这件事，因为我刚在医疗保健行业待了几年，根据我的经验，那里的领导岗位上有更多的女性。我被宠坏了一点，甚至在我们的技术组织里也是。而现在，我回到了初创公司和科技圈，这里的比例完全相反，尤其是在我管理的工程团队这样的岗位上。\n\n(00:33:30):\n看，这只是数学问题。我想 Carta 说过去年只有 13% 左右的创始人是女性，而且这个数字每年都在下降。女性领导的团队只占风险投资的 2%，女性持有 30% 的高管职位。女性占软件工程团队的 30%。这就是数学，这就是事实。我们在房间里的比例并不对等。作为一个尽管数据如此，但在科技领域至今仍拥有相当成功职业生涯的人，我觉得我有责任对行业说：这并不容易，即使到了我这个级别，依然不容易。\n\n(00:34:09):\n我想要明确的一点是，因为在类似的场合中这个话题经常被提及，但这并不是关于“冒充者综合征”(Imposter Syndrome，指尽管取得成就，仍怀疑自己的能力并担心被揭穿为骗子的心理倾向)。我凭什么会有“冒充者综合征”呢？我已经证明了自己。我曾是创始人，筹集过风险投资，有过成功的退出（Exit，指公司被收购或上市）。如你所说，我曾在规模不断扩大的团队中担任首席产品官（CPO，Chief Product Officer）。我有机会投资红杉资本（Sequoia）投资的公司。我是董事会成员。我有幸参加这个播客。我还是 TikTok 上的网红。所以，这并不是觉得自己像个冒充者。这实际上是因为，这件事确实很难，而且环境也不同，那些数据算下来的结果对女性并不友好。\n\n(00:34:47):\n正如你所说，过去发生过很多事情。你看现在的我，可能会说：“哦，她从初级职位（Associate）一路做到了最高层。” 但我曾经不得不为了让我的女子学校开设计算机科学课程而奋斗，才能达到男校自然拥有的同等水平。我在 2000 年代初期的小型初创公司中成长。我见过一些荒谬的事情。当我……的时候，有风险投资人（VC）告诉我：“别怀孕。” 这些事情确实发生过。然而，我走到了今天，一切都很好。\n\n(00:35:21):\n我并不是在抱怨。我只是觉得，人们不理解的是，这些事情依然在发生。我不需要去指控具体是谁干的、在哪里发生的。它就是还在发生。我已经达到了今天的高度，但它依然在发生。我提起这一点的原因是，我认为这应该是行业反思的一个点，而且对于想要进入领导岗位的女性来说，这也可以是一个非常有效的反思点。\n\n(00:35:46):\n我处理这件事的方式是保持高度的好奇。我在想，技术领域在结构上（Structural）有什么特质导致了这些事情的发生？哪些是文化上的（Cultural）？哪些是外部的？发生在我身上或我周围的事情，哪些是内部的（Internal）？我带进房间里的哪些东西是对我没帮助的？所以我尽量保持非常好奇的心态。然后，作为一个资深的产品思维者（Product Thinker），我会思考：我可以使用哪些杠杆点（Points of Leverage）来推动事物的发展，不仅是为了我个人，而是为了整个行业？我可以在哪里影响他人的想法？哪里不行？哪里我可以抽身而退？\n\n(00:36:24):\n至于内在方面，我认为这也是一件非常有力量的事情，那就是我努力保持在一种“赋能状态”（Empowered Space，指感到自己有力量和掌控感的状态）。我知道自己的价值。我没时间去理会什么“冒充者综合征”。对我来说，那不是建设性的。但我确实认为，正如我之前所说，宇宙是可以随你的意志而弯曲的。有些事情我们可以改变。我不认为这些数据是无法处理的。所以，我的建议，以及我想对整个行业，特别是对女性说的是：在这个有时复杂的行业里，好奇心和自我赋能一直是我通往快乐的路径。我认为我们可以做得更好。虽然还有一段路要走。\n\nLenny (00:37:10):\n如果你愿意的话，能否分享一个故事，关于你经历过的或遭遇过的事情，或许能让人们感叹：“哦，哇，我现在明白她或其他女性正在处理的是什么样的事情了，而我以前完全没意识到。”\n\nClaire Vo (00:37:21):\n我一直在努力思考这个问题。那就是我经常被问到我是否“足够技术化”（Technical enough）。甚至不是“足够”，我们把“足够”放一边，就是问我“是否懂技术”。这对我来说非常不可思议，因为作为我初创公司的技术联合创始人，我独自编写了前 12 个月的代码。我领导了那里的工程团队。那些代码现在仍在非常大型的生产环境（Production Environment）中运行。我多年来管理过数百人的工程团队，我周六周日的时间都在写代码（Shipping Code）。这就是我的工作。但真的，大多数人问我的第一个问题通常是：“哦，你并不懂技术，你是个做产品的。”\n\n(00:38:11):\n我一直在试图拆解这种看法的来源。我很难想象一个外表不同、名字不同、性别不同的人，在拥有我这样的背景下会被问到这个问题。所以，这是最让我感到困扰的事情之一。再次强调，这不是关于“冒充者综合征”。我不需要向人们证明什么，但我非常好奇这种倾向是从哪里来的。如果这种事发生在我这样一个已经取得了一定成功的人身上，那我知道它也正发生在其他人身上。我希望我能利用我的职位做点什么，来稍微扭转这种局面。\n\nLenny (00:38:50):\n这和你刚才分享的建议联系起来了，就是试着对事情为什么会发生保持好奇，这正是你刚才所说的。这主要是为了帮助你保持心态，不让自己感到生气和沮丧吗？我想理解一下，为什么要一次又一次地探究这背后的原因？\n\nClaire Vo (00:39:02):\n第一，我确实认为“身处权力位置”（Sitting in your power）是非常有效的。保持好奇心意味着我处于掌控之中，而且我认为我掌控的部分比失控的部分多。这是其中一个原因。另一方面，我认为这其中很多事情都很复杂。有结构性的原因，有文化上的原因。还有你在职场之外看到和没看到的东西。它也关乎你在媒体中看到和没看到的内容。我给我的 7 岁和 4 岁的孩子读的书里，有没有提到“我的奶奶是一名软件工程师”？\n\n(00:39:35):\n有一本书叫《妈妈测试》(The Mom Test，虽然是一本很棒的关于需求验证的书)，但它潜意识里预设了谁是懂技术的，谁是不懂的，谁能理解事物，谁不能。这些都会累积成个人对一个正在推动巨大经济增长的行业的体验。归根结底，这是关于经济参与（Economic Participation）的问题。它可以是关于个人和抱负的，但也是关于经济参与的。\n\n(00:40:00):\n我之所以好奇，是因为我确实认为这很复杂，我也认为你可以取得成功，但我不认为我们目前的成功率达到了我希望看到的水平。而且我认为，如果没有那些优秀的、有技术能力的女性去创办公司、领导组织，我们会失去很多创新和经济增长。所以我认为我们都在为此蒙受损失，我希望能看到更多（女性领导者）。\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\n关于如何做得更好，有什么答案吗？你有没有见过什么方法可以帮助我们度过这个阶段？\n\nClaire Vo (00:40:34):\n我认为“让这种现象变得常态化”是最简单的方法之一，所以感谢你邀请我参加这个播客。如果你闭上眼睛想象一个软件工程师，我的梦想是你会想象到各色各样的人，而不是一个非常具体的原型（Archetype）。所以我认为，眼见才能为实。因此，你越多地为不同的声音提供平台来讲述他们的技术之路，展示那些来自不同技术、文化背景的领导者，这个行业就越能想象不同类型的领导者担任不同类型的角色。\n\n(00:41:17):\n所以我只想看到更多。我想更多地投资并放大女性创始人的声音。我想表彰那些了不起的女性首席技术官（CTO）等等。我认为，如果你能看到它，你就能开始解锁这些根深蒂固的概念——关于谁是、谁不是技术领导者，谁懂、谁不懂技术。\n\nLenny (00:41:40):\n太棒了。我非常喜欢这个建议。这也是我在这档播客中努力尝试去做的事情。\n\n(00:41:44):\n本集节目由 Vanta 赞助。当涉及到确保你的公司拥有顶级的安全实践时，事情会变得非常复杂。现在，你可以通过 Vanta 这一个平台来评估风险、赢得客户信任，并自动化处理 SOC 2、ISO 27001、HIPAA 等合规认证。Vanta

Engine，这是一个供企业运行大规模实验计划的平台。不一定是底层的 A/B 测试技术，而是围绕假设收集、洞察聚合、运营和保持项目进度等所有事情。因为我非常清楚，正如你所知，大规模的实验计划对业务非常有影响力。\n\n(00:43:19):\n即便如此，它更像是行业内的一个细分领域，而不是一个巨大的“总可服务市场”（TAM, Total Addressable Market）问题。所以我认为我们基本上遇到了 TAM 的天花板。我们针对一个非常狭窄的优秀市场有一款优秀的产品。经营公司三四年后，我知道这是事实，我也知道如果我们成为一个更大组织的一部分，会发展得更好，而那样的组织可能是一家大型测试公司。我记得我一直在思考这件事，但我们也真的在努力向大企业销售。\n\n(00:43:52):\n我听说微软（我们最大的客户之一）正在与 Optimizely 举办一个“实验日”（Experimentation Day），我知道 Optimizely 是一个很自然的收购方。我知道我必须进入那个房间，所以我给微软打了电话，我说：“嘿，微软的朋友，我这周要去西雅图看我们的另一个客户，也是西雅图的一家大公司，正好是实验日那一周。我们可以顺便过去吗？” 他们说：“噢，当然可以。” 然后我又去找了西雅图的另一家大公司说：“嘿，西雅图的大公司，我这周要去参加微软的实验日。你们愿意……”\n\n(00:44:34):\n我让这两个会议互相借力促成了，然后我走进了那个“实验日”，我盯上了 Optimizely 的首席财务官（CFO），我坐在他面前，同时开始打开产品并编写代码。我当时心想：“我要坐在他那一排的前面，我要做这个，我们要展示我的屏幕。” 然后我上台做了一个演示。我并不是说这就是促成收购的原因，但我会说，在那之后很快我们就成为了非常亲密的合作伙伴，最终他们收购了我的公司。\n\n(00:45:06):\n我把这个建议给到创始人们，包括创始人以及产品经理（PM），我招聘时非常看重的一点就是“拼劲”（Scrappiness）。我认为你必须能以少办多，我认为你必须知道你要去哪里，并且无论遇到什么困难（Come hell or high water），都要想办法到达那里。这是一个非常有趣的例子：我想方设法进入正确的房间，为我想要的成功铺路，并有扎实的工作、伟大的产品和成果作为支撑。但你首先必须让自己进入那个房间。\n\nLenny (00:45:39):\n那你当时怀孕几个月了？\n\nClaire Vo (00:45:44):\n当时我已经处于怀孕晚期了。在交易中，一个“定时炸弹”般的大肚子是一个非常好的谈判策略。我记得当我们谈判最终的条款清单（Term Sheet）时，我怀孕 34 周左右，他们问：“你能飞到旧金山吗？” 我当时在奥斯汀。我说：“字面上看，你今天可以把我接过去，明天送回来，再往后我就不被允许上飞机了。” 就是这样。非常有趣。那是一次非常开心的收购，我可以聊上一整天关于那次多么棒的经历。\n\nLenny (00:46:11):\n我很喜欢这个例子，这又是你反复提到的那句话，“让世界……”，我不知道是不是“让世界顺应你的意志”。\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:17):\n让宇宙随你的意志而弯曲。\n\nLenny (00:46:19):\n宇宙？更广阔了。我喜欢这个说法。这里似乎有一个反复出现的主题，就是掌握主动权（Agency），掌控你的职业生涯和生活的走向。通过这种方式进入一个门槛极高的圈子，确实是一个非常棒的例子。\n\n(00:46:33):\n你提到了 CTPO（Chief Technology and Product Officer，首席技术产品官）这个角色，我之前没怎么听说过。我知道这对你来说是一个重要的话题，而且我觉得这可能是一种将工程与产品职能合并的新趋势。你能谈谈这个角色吗？为什么你认为它正在兴起？\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:51):\n是的，经常有人问我这个问题，因为它虽然不是极其罕见，但也确实不怎么普遍，而且我认为它有增长的潜力。我用 CPTO（Chief Product and Technology Officer，首席产品技术官）作为简称，指代在职能上同时管理产品、工程和设计（Design）。这非常不同，我两样都做过。它与纯粹的产品负责人或产品副总裁（VP of Product）角色截然不同。\n\n(00:47:13):\n首先，我谈谈我是如何进入这个角色的。我认为要担任这样的职务，你必须具备技术背景。很多人看我的职业背景，会觉得我是利用广泛的领导技能，通过一位优秀的工程高级副总裁（SVP of Engineering）来维持工程团队的运作。但事实并非如此，实际上我在工程方面投入了大量时间。因为作为负责产品业务成果（Business outcomes）的人，推动价值的最佳途径之一，就是拥有一支在可扩展平台（Scalable platform）上工作的高性能工程团队。\n\n(00:47:45):\n因此，我花了很多时间确保我们做出了正确的架构决策（Architectural decisions），确保我们的基础设施（Infrastructure）满足团队需求，确保我们的工程团队以驱动速率（Velocity）的方式运作。如果你不从技术层面理解软件是如何构建的，我认为你无法胜任这份工作。所以我属于那种在进行产品评审时，会同时打开 PRD（Product Requirements Document，产品需求文档）和 GitHub，并将两者进行对比的人，因为我认为两方面都至关重要。\n\n(00:48:10):\n我认为这个角色的另一个不同之处在于，它是非常偏向运营（Operational）的，所以你必须精通运营和组织设计（Organization design）。工程团队天生就比产品组织庞大得多。想想经典的配比就知道了，工程人员总是比产品人员多。而且工程领域的人才挑战也显著不同，无论是高强度的招聘，还是文化塑造方面的挑战都各不相同。你必须真正思考组织设计。因此，当你担任 CPTO 角色时，你需要具备不同层次的组织设计和运营思维。\n\n(00:48:51):\n你需要负责值班（Pager Duty）。如果某个服务在凌晨 1 点出现故障，或者发生了 0 级事故（Sub-Zero，最高等级事故），你会被叫醒。这和单纯做产品负责人是完全不同的。所以你得清楚自己要承担什么，而且你必须懂技术。另外，我不得不提的是，在这个角色中，“P”（产品）和“T”（技术）获得了最多的关注，但设计（Design）和数据（Data）也是非常职能化且极其重要的组织。这就是这个角色的本质，以及如何才能做好这个角色，或者它是否适合你的技能。\n\n(00:49:24):\n至于为什么要设立这样的角色，我认为有两个原因。首先是显而易见的战略原因：它们本质上是同一回事。他们都在构建大写的“产品”（Capital P Product），他们都是构建者（Builders），是同一类人。将他们归入同一个部门，可以让你针对整体进行优化，而不是针对某个职能进行局部优化。如果你能找到一个能有效执行这一点的领导者，我认为会产生巨大的增值。说实话，第二个原因是它在很多方面为首席执行官（CEO）提供了巨大的杠杆。归根结底，研发（R&D）是公司一项非常昂贵且复杂的投资，在执行层面由单一负责人负责研发投资是非常重要的，尤其是当你在那里的开支非常大时。\n\n(00:50:21):\n所以我认为就是这两点。第一，这是一个团队。不应该有关于“什么对产品最好”或“什么对工程最好”、“什么对设计最好”的争论。应该考虑的是什么对整个组织最好。我们的客户需要什么？我们的业务需要什么？第二，坦白说，就是针对这项对业务目标至关重要的重大投资建立问责机制，并由一个单独的人来负责这项投资。\n\nLenny (00:50:46):\n听起来很棒，由一个人来处理所有这些职能。\n\nClaire Vo (00:50:50):\n既是也不是。我想说，这两种模式我都经历过。我曾做过与工程高级副总裁并列的首席产品官（CPO），也曾同时管理过这两个部门。创始人也可以扮演这个角色。我再次强调，你必须根据组织内的人才进行优化。如果你的 CEO 有能力、有精力去做这件事，他们可以做，你可以保持组织独立，由他们统筹。如果他们的专长在其他领域，或者从未做过这类工作，或者在运营上行不通，由于他们有更广泛的关注点，那么就把这些职能交给一个人来管理。我不认为存在完美的组织架构，这只是在需要像我这样的人才的组织形式中，运作得比较好的一种。\n\nLenny (00:51:33):\n顺着这个思路，围绕人来设计组织，我猜想具备深厚工程背景经验，同时又非常擅长产品和设计的人并不多。我想知道，要在这一角色上取得成功，你在每一个职能领域需要钻研到什么程度？因为这感觉确实很罕见。\n\nClaire Vo (00:51:51):\n在某种程度上，如果你创办一家公司，你就必须这样做。我曾为两位 CEO 工作过，他们都对我说：“我不是创始人，但我是 CEO。” 我回答说：“没关系，我是执行者（Operator），但我会带来创始人思维（Founder mindset）。”\n\n(00:52:08):\n所以我认为，作为一名创始人，尤其是早期阶段，你得包揽所有这些工作。你会看到所有这些职能是如何集中在一个人身上的，因为说实话，有时确实只有一个人，而那个人就是你。因此，我认为在非常小型的创业公司工作，能让你有机会体验广泛的职能技能，并培养出一套能够让你在未来很久以后胜任这类角色的综合技能。我认为早期创业公司的经历是获得这种视野的捷径之一。\n\n(00:52:46):\n另一件事是，正如我之前提到的，很多人被困在信息茧房（Siloed）里，认为“我是产品经理，所以我的工作是这个，而不是那个。我只能做这个，如果需要设计，我就被卡住了，只能等待。” 我会授权人们去突破……我们团队内部有一个领导力原则，叫做“不设限”（There are no lanes）。我们的分工界限是虚线，而不是实线，这意味着你可以跨界去画一个草图，工程师也可以写一份需求规范（Spec）。所有这些都没问题。这些都很自然、很正常，而且我认为这非常健康。正是这种思维方式，可能会孕育出能够胜任这类角色的领导者。\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\n太棒了。这让我想起了 GitLab。我刚采访了他们的产品负责人，也就是 CPO，他们有一个核心价值观叫“短脚趾”（Short toes）。别担心踩到别人的脚趾。保持“短脚趾”，别担心别人介入你的领地。这都很好。\n\nClaire Vo (00:53:43):\n没错。\n\nLenny (00:53:43):\n好的。你提到了 AI。这为我下一个想花点时间讨论的话题提供了完美的过渡。你开发了一个名为 ChatPRD 的工具。我猜它是目前除了一些大公司的工具（比如 Sprig 或 Figma 等）之外，最受欢迎的 AI 产品经理专属工具。首先，ChatPRD 到底是什么？你为什么要开发它？\n\nClaire Vo (00:54:06):\n是的。ChatPRD 的诞生再次源于“设定节奏”（Pace setting）。其实我可以告诉你 ChatPRD 真正的起源。在之前的一家公司，我们需要开发一个技术性非常强的产品。我们当时很精干，资源有限，而我们的平台产品经理（Platform PMs）正忙于另一件非常重要的事情，但这个项目也很关键，必须完成。我们当时并没有真正的平台技术产品经理来撰写这个产品的需求规范，而且它相当复杂。\n\n(00:54:35):\n于是我举手说：“我来作为个人贡献者（IC，Individual Contributor）完成这个。我想我知道我们需要什么。” 在会议开始到结束之间，我利用 ChatGPT 和一段提示词（Prompt），为一个技术性极强的产品生成了一个非常可用的 PRD 规范。我保留了那段提示词和那个长期的 ChatGPT 对话线程，精心打造了一个“Claire 版”的产品领导者或产品人形象。它能够极其稳定地输出产品规范、提供良好的反馈、制定计划、建立跟踪机制和目标。\n\n(00:55:20):\n虽然我说“她可能只是一个提示词，但她确实非常敏捷（Prompt）”，这是经过几个月精心打磨的结果。所以当 GPT Store（GPT 商店）推出时，我直接对我的团队说：“嘿，你们都知道我一直在用 ChatGPT 写 PRD。” 我创建了一个 GPT 专门给我的团队用。我说：“诺，如果你们想要可以用这个。” 他们非常喜欢，接着其他人也开始打听，最终我遇到了目前 GPT Store 的变现和访问限制。而且，我最近重新开始写代码，玩得很开心，于是我想，这很简单，我们直接搭建一个独立的应用，做一个封装（Wrapper）——说实话，它最初就是一个封装应用——封装这些功能并发布，定一个相当合理的价格，看看会发生什么。\n\n(00:56:12):\n而现在，我有成千上万的人在使用 ChatPRD。每天人们都在创建成打的规范，每月产出海量的 PRD。它的用户群很广，有“团队中 PM 太少导致工作受阻，所以要自己写需求”的工程师，有“需要为团队理清思路”的独立创始人，还有“这确实帮我节省了数小时基础工作，让我能专注细节”的产品经理。之后，我在独立应用中加入了比 GPT Store 版本更多的功能和特性。它就是我发布给全世界使用的个人“产品副驾驶”（Product copilot）。\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\n好的。首先，大家可以在哪里查看？是 chatprd.com 吗？\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:53):\n是 .ai。拜托。\n\nLenny (00:56:54):\n当然，是 .ai。\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:54):\n是的，chatprd.ai。\n\nLenny (00:56:58):\n我看到一些报道说，拥有 .ai 域名的那个国家现在简直赚翻了。\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:01):\n赚了大钱。\n\nLenny (00:57:02):\n全是这些域名。\n\n(00:57:04):\n那么关于技术栈（Stack），为了明确起见，它起初是一个 ChatGPT 的自定义提示词，然后你改进了它，接着它变成了一个 GPT（自定义 GPT），现在它是一个使用 OpenAI API 的独立应用，后台使用了……\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:17):\n是的。它使用的是 Assistant API（助手 API）。独立应用与 GPT 的不同之处在于，每个使用独立应用的人都会获得一个定制化的助手。它会学习用户的特定内容、学习他们的角色、学习他们的公司。如果你使用 GPT 版本，你得不到这种定制化。当你使用独立应用时，你可以获得这种定制化。此外，我还增加了一些不同的功能。除了对话格式，它实际上会为你创建文档，并直接在文档上进行迭代。未来我还在开发一些额外的工具和集成功能。\n\nLenny (00:57:55):\n太棒了。最常见的用例有哪些？这样大家可以有个概念，“噢，我也可以用它来做这些事。”\n\nClaire Vo (00:58:00):\n是的，大约 60% 的人使用它来输入一个想法并获得一份 PRD（Product Requirements Document，产品需求文档）。只需获得规格说明，比如我的目标和用户目标是什么，用户故事（User Stories）是什么，哪些是不在范围内的，以及梳理 UX（User Experience，用户体验）。在我们的标准模板中，我加入了一个被称为“叙述”（Narrative）的部分，也就是：你如何推销这个产品？我觉得这是产品经理经常忽略的一点，即如何定位和推销它，还有排序和里程碑、衡量标准和目标，诸如此类的所有事情。\n\n(00:58:33):\n现在，那是开箱即用（Out-of-the-box）的模板。正如我所说，如果你有不同的做法或者公司有特殊需求，你实际上可以在 ChatPRD 中自定义你的 PRD 模板。大约 60% 的人是为了这个目的而使用它。我想说，还有 30% 的人使用它是为了输入一份规格说明、PRD、战略文档或路线图（Roadmap）并对其进行改进。剩下的则是用来进行头脑风暴、内部 PM（Product Manager，产品经理）工作。比如，我该如何为某项活动制定一个好的议程？诸如此类的事情。\n\nLenny (00:59:02):\n太棒了。好的，我最近写了一篇文章，分享了很多人们在工作中具体使用不同 GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer，生成式预训练模型）的例子，我想这激励了很多人去尝试这些东西。如果让你给那些尝试构建 GPT 或使用 API（Application Programming Interface，应用程序接口）构建自定义应用的人分享一个秘诀，你有什么建议吗？\n\nClaire Vo (00:59:24):\nPrompt（提示词）至关重要。我们经历过这样一个循环：提示词工程（Prompt Engineering）很重要，它又不怎么重要，微调（Fine-tuning）才是关键……其实提示词真的很重要。作为一个优秀的 PM，我会做竞品分析。我会使用相同的输入，观察不同的 GPT 或 ChatGPT 的表现。我会看 GPT Store（GPT 商店）版本，看其他做这类工具的 PM 工具，然后再看我的。我认为我的工具实际上表现更好。\n\n(00:59:50):\n我现在正进入一种模式，可能会在幕后进行一些模型实验和调优（Tuning），所以它可能不再仅仅是 OpenAI 的模型，也可能是其他的，但这很重要。指令很重要，上下文（Context）对于输出质量也很重要，这是我在构建这类产品时想说的。我认为另一件事是，目前还没有现成的变现方案。谢天谢地，OpenAI 会解决这个问题的。如果我有更多时间，也许我会把我为 ChatGPT 创建的东西做成一个平台，让其他人能够将他们的 GPT 变现并增加功能。但对于大家来说，目前还没有现成的方案。为了把它从现在的样子推向那个目标，我还有很多工作要做。\n\nLenny (01:00:31):\n你通过这个项目赚到真金白银了吗？它是否是一个你未来（可能是长期）会全职投入的想法？\n\nClaire Vo (01:00:38):\n我最初的目标——我也在 X（前 Twitter）上说过——我最初的目标只是想每周能买得起一杯好酒。那就是我的目标。现在我可以按箱买酒了。这对我来说非常令人兴奋。它正在赚取我认为的“真钱”。它是一个风投规模（Venture scale，具有巨大增长潜力的初创规模）的东西吗？不。它需要是吗？不。我有一个关于孩子教育费用的目标，我希望这个项目能负担一点。我对 ChatPRD 有一个宏大但不过分狂妄的目标。\n\n(01:01:13):\n我的另一个目标是——让我们撇开变现不谈——这是我的快乐源泉，是我的“天才领域”（Zone of genius）和快乐空间。我对 ChatPRD 的要求是它必须对我来说是 100% 有趣的。这是我的业余爱好，所以我不会做任何让它变得无趣的事情。对我来说，这是一个纯粹的幸福空间。我可以在周末写代码，晚上做客户支持，构建我会使用的东西，学习新技术。我想让它保持在这个状态，因为它给我带来了很多快乐。把钱放在一边，我只想让它保持趣味性。\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\n太棒了。好的，有些听众，特别是 PM 们，可能会想：“Claire，你到底在干什么？你打算在一年或两年内取代产品经理吗？”这联系到了我一直在思考并被多次提及的一个话题，那就是随着时间的推移，产品经理的哪些技能和工作会被 AI 大大增强，而哪些会被 AI 完全取代（如果有的话），这样人们就能明白他们应该投资哪些技能，而哪些可能不再那么重要。\n\n(01:02:22):\n我想泛泛地问一下，你是否感觉到，哪些技能将继续保持极其重要，AI 不会从你手中夺走这些技能和工作？相比之下，哪些会变得不那么重要，AI 会代劳？\n\nClaire Vo (01:02:36):\n在最高层面，我往往倾向于短期悲观，但我会将其界定为短期悲观而长期非常乐观。我坚信技术让社会总体上变得更加富足、富有、幸福和健康。我是技术的坚定信徒，我对技术对人类的影响持乐观态度。虽然有很多事情进展得并不顺利，但我真的相信创新和技术，我为我孩子的未来感到兴奋。我并不害怕它。\n\n(01:03:11):\n尽管如此，我兴奋地认为这将以惊人的速度改变公司内部的事务。构建 ChatPRD 的部分原因在于，作为一名技术领导者，我以此来要求自己：我需要带头理解这可能会颠覆（Disrupt）什么，利用这些工具建立一个更好的团队，并实际上根据我们周围的技术来调整我组织的规模和形态。明年它会消灭 PM 吗？可能不会。PM 与其他团队之间的比例会随着时间推移而改变吗？是的。所需的技能会改变吗？是的。这些转变会比我们预想的快得多吗？很有可能。我认为有很多变革即将到来，我想为此做好准备。\n\n(01:04:00):\n那么，我认为这会取代什么，又不会取代什么？我也在反思这个问题。我认为“小写 c 的沟通”（communication）是将被取代的领域之一。我称之为小写 c，它是为了让其他人能够开展工作而进行的职能性信息交换。我认为这些语言模型和工具非常擅长综合信息、整理沟通内容，并且能够协调这些沟通发给谁，并以多种内容模态（Modalities）发布。\n\n(01:04:41):\n因此，我真的在思考，PM 作为跨职能（Cross-functional）关系和沟通维护者的角色，确实有可能会发生改变。但是，“大写 C 的沟通”（Communication），比如你是否有影响力？你是否有说服力？你是否大胆？你能否让这群人类系统跟随你走上一条道路？我认为那将很难被取代。所以我正在思考沟通的边缘，哪些会改变，哪些不会。\n\nLenny (01:05:15):\n这真的很有趣。我在 Twitter 上做了一个小调查，询问人们在沟通、执行、战略和产品感（Product sense）中，哪些技能最有可能被 AI 接管。到目前为止，沟通是票数第一的。但我有一个相反的观点。战略是票数最少的。我觉得，战略工作本质上是：“这是我们所知道的关于世界、竞争对手、市场和我们优势的一切。这是一份在市场中获胜的计划。”我觉得这正是 AI 极其擅长的。\n\nClaire Vo (01:05:49):\n我同意你的看法。我完全同意。我认为，这再次回到了综合（Synthesis）、优秀的决策制定和沟通。如果你能综合信息，将其提炼（Distill）成一份计划并传达该计划，我发现这些工具表现卓越。去用用 ChatPRD 试试看就知道了。\n\n(01:06:09):\n不过，我认为人类层面的东西在于“胆识”（Boldness），在于以一种基于先验知识（Priors）训练出的机器无法做到的方式预见未来。这些东西我认为仍然是核心，还有个人魅力（Charisma）以及吸引所有这些因素来促成事情发生，这些都很难被复制。这也是为什么我喜欢使用 ChatPRD。我不会为了某个……比如为 Snowflake（一种云端数据仓库）导出数据想出一种最天才的方法。那是一个已经解决的领域，我们只需要把它搭起来（Scaffold up）就行。我应该根据我们的业务对其进行定制，然后将其发布。那不是我作为人类的神奇技能发挥影响的地方。\n\n(01:06:54):\n但我不认为很多 PM 是这样看的。我认为将会发生一种真正的身份转变（Identity shift），PM 们过去认为他们的价值来自于他们表现（Manifest）在世界上的想法，以及他们个人如何体现这些想法。而我认为我们将转向：你是否在构建正确的东西？你是否在快速构建？它是否带来了价值？无论使用的是什么工具链（Tool chain）。\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\n是的。我认为你提到的关于获得认可（Buy-in）和让大家步调一致（Alignment）的观点非常重要。我不知道 AI 机器人如何做到这一点，除非每个人都有自己的小机器人，而且它们都在互相交流。\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:29):\n它们只是相处得很融洽。\n\nLenny (01:07:30):\n我们加入了。我会[听不清 01:07:32]稍微提高一点。\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:32):\n是的。\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\n我其实列了这张清单。我觉得这可以做成一整期播客，但我快速列了一个“PM 的职责清单”。这很有意思。我不知道这算不算一个问题，但思考其中哪些职责未来可能会由 ChatPRD 这样的工具来完成是很有趣的。这份工作的感觉是什么？你在写 PRD，你在设定目标，提出路线图，让团队在路线图背后达成一致，制定战略，构筑愿景（Vision），沟通时间线，发现障碍（Blockers）并为人们扫除障碍，从高层获得认可，为你的团队争取预算资源，对产品和设计提供反馈。这些只是日常工作中的一部分。我很好奇 AI 到底能直接完成其中的哪些，而让我们无需再操心。\n\nClaire Vo (01:08:17):\n我认为 AI 能做很多。所以问题在于，你想要把哪些职责的钥匙交给 AI 工具？而哪些职责通过个人或团队的才智使用工具支持，能完成得更好、更快、影响力更高，从而变得更有价值？\n\n(01:08:38):\n同样，我信仰技术。我认为有趣的是，现在的每一周，我都能看到一些在三年前我做梦也想不到能实现的东西。每周都有新东西出现，改变我对可能性的认知。我相信所有这些职责在功能上 80% 都是可处理的。问题在于，功能上达到 80% 的水平是否是完成那项工作的最佳方式？或者我们是否可以让某种具备特定技能的人，在专用工具包的支持下，把工作做得好 3 倍、4 倍、甚至 10 倍？我认为这才是更有趣的问题。\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\n关于每天都在发生神奇的事情这一点，我想到了 SpaceX 发射了“星舰”（Starship），但在媒体上几乎没人提起。我们有了可以将我们送往火星的飞船，而人们却觉得：“切，我们没必要讨论那个。”\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:31):\n我们叫醒孩子们，在 YouTube 上看直播。\n\nLenny (01:09:32):\n噢，那太棒了。\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:33):\n这就是魔法。我们生活在这个充满魔法的时代。我觉得这太迷人了。但我同意，我们正被创新给宠坏了。\n\nLenny (01:09:41):\n你提到产品经理和工程师之间的比例可能会发生变化。我很好奇是哪种比例，因为工程师也变得越来越高效，所以如果工程师变高效的同时 PM 也变高效，比例是否会保持一致，这很有趣。\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:53):\n我在想，是否整个角色都会被消除和取代，然后“比例”甚至不再是思考问题的正确方式。目前有这种 PM 角色对多少人的比例，1 个 PM 对 7 到 10 个工程师，或者 1 个 EM（Engineering Manager，工程经理）对……目前存在这些比例。\n\n(01:10:12):\n我还认为，作为一名管理者和领导者，你如何平衡工具和人员的预算分配，这方面也会发生有趣的转变。我看到有人提到，他们团队被要求在申请开放每一个新职位之前，必须先花一周时间尝试用自动化手段解决该职位的需求，然后才允许发布 JD（Job Description，职位描述）。这非常有趣……在我看来，人们觉得这很可怕，认为这会减少就业机会。诚然，这确实有可能，但我认为同时也可能开启其他非常有趣的职位。\n\n(01:10:45):\n所以我不确定最终的结果会如何。我真的不知道。我所知道的是，事情将会发生变化。作为一名领导者，一个关心员工长期职业发展的人，我希望自己能够更有前瞻性，而不是对行业内可能发生的戏剧性变化视而不见。我一直在思考这件事，也在进行各种实验，我希望我们在 LaunchDarkly 的团队能够在这方面走在最前沿，而不是被动应对。\n\nLenny (01:11:17):\n我想很多听众现在可能会想：“好吧，我需要掌握这些，我需要保持领先，我想效仿 Claire 的做法。” 你的建议是简单地去创建 GPTs（定制化生成式预训练转化器），或者玩玩 ChatGPT 吗？还有什么其他可以帮助大家的建议吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:11:29):\n我还认为 PM（Product Manager，产品经理）需要思考如何培养产品技能，特别是围绕这些 Non-deterministic products（非确定性产品，指输出结果不完全固定的 AI 产品）。这一直是 [音质不清 01:11:40]。我开发 ChatPRD 的部分原因，不仅仅是为了压力测试这些东西将如何改变产品职能。从字面上看，这是一种由新技术构建的新型产品，而且发展速度极快。学会如何构建这类产品，如果你能做到这一点——我回想起移动互联网爆发的时候，如果你是当时投身移动领域的 PM，那么在非常有趣的初创公司中，你可以随心所欲地挑选职位。\n\n(01:12:11):\n所以我觉得我们现在正处于同样的时刻。如果你能静下心来钻研、专业化并学习一项新技术，你确实能获得非常有利的职业地位。这些都是我开发 ChatPRD 的动力：一是了解它如何影响我所领导的职能部门，二是了解如何利用这些底层的、与我个人以前构建的技术大不相同的新技术，来打造一款伟大的产品。\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\n那么对于那些，比如说，不那么精通工程技术的人，你建议你团队里的成员如何探索这类事物呢？是通过 [音质不清 01:12:46] 吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:12:45):\n是的。我认为研究现有的产品是非常有趣的。我非常喜欢做“由外向内”的 Product Tear-downs（产品拆解分析）。这个产品哪里好？哪里不好？如果是我的话，我会怎么写这里的 PRD（Product Requirements Document，产品需求文档）？我会衡量哪些指标？我会如何考虑 Error states（错误状态）？我会如何定义这是一款伟大的产品、好的产品，还是一款平庸的产品？我认为对外部产品进行这种 Crit（Critique，评论/分析）是一种非常容易上手的、压力测试自身技能并发现差距的方式。\n\n(01:13:20):\n这是我认为你可以做的一件事。第二，我认为有很多 No-code（无代码）和 Low-code（低代码）的工具可以尝试。即使你不会亲手编写代码，你也完全可以将各种功能拼接在一起，尝试一些无代码工具。这是另一种方式。还有一点是，寻找其中的乐趣。我觉得 Midjourney（一款 AI 绘画工具）多有趣啊？一些更具创造性的工具多好玩啊？所以，找个有趣的地方，用它来创作艺术，作为学习的一种手段。它不一定非得是商业驱动的，也不必是工作的一部分。只需要找一个你个人感兴趣的领域，去玩转现有的工具。\n\nLenny (01:14:00):\n太棒了。关于 ChatPRD 最后一个问题。关于 Copilot（GitHub 的 AI 编程助手），有很多统计数据，比如它让工程师的效率提高了 50% 之类的。你对 ChatPRD 目前带来的效率提升有什么感觉吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:14):\n我收到了使用过 ChatPRD 的产品经理们的 Qualitative feedback（定性反馈），有人说：“这帮我节省了原本要花在写文档上的几十个小时。” 另一个人说：“我是团队中唯一的 PM，而团队正在扩张，我觉得我们现在不需要再招一个 PM 了。” 这涉及人员、个人层面以及时间层面。它在帮助 PM 个人在广泛的工程或开发团队中获得更高的 Leverage（杠杆作用/产出比），帮助他们更有效地利用时间。\n\nLenny (01:14:57):\n很多人可能不想听到“不需要再招 PM”这样的话。现在有很多人在找工作。\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:59):\n确实如此，但我们不能……我想我们在过去几年里已经看到了这一点。低效的招聘和为公司增加不可持续的成本，不会让任何人获得成功。如果说有什么教训是我可以教给任何人的，那就是：组织的 Sustainability（可持续性）是领导者的责任。是的，我很想给每个人提供职位，但实际上并没有那么多职位。我能为团队成员做的最好的事情，就是对招聘保持非常负责和深思熟虑的态度，因为这有助于我帮助他们发展事业，并长期维持他们的职业生涯。\n\n(01:15:41):\n这非常复杂。但从另一方面来看，这是一家非常小的初创公司。他们雇不起另一个 PM，他们通过不扩大团队规模来延长自己的 Runway（资金跑道），从而打造出具有变革意义的产品。所以，是的，虽然人们希望 [音质不清 01:15:57] 他们的团队并拥有这些工作，但初创公司负担不起，而他们仍然有伟大的事业要去完成。\n\nLenny (01:16:04):\n很棒的回答。在结束我们的对话之前，我有两个环节，“失败角落 (Failure Corner)”和“非主流观点角落 (Contrarian Corner)”，我们可以选一个。你是想分享一个职业生涯中失败的故事及学到的教训？还是分享一些你相信但大多数人不认同的观点？哪个环节听起来更有趣？\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:24):\n我选“非主流观点角落”。\n\nLenny (01:16:26):\n那我们就选这个。\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:27):\n好。\n\nLenny (01:16:28):\n我得给这些环节配点音效。请开始你的分享。\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:33):\n我分享这个是因为你刚又发布了和 Marty (Marty Cagan) 的播客。我是一个毫不避讳的 Sales-led product apologist（销售驱动型产品的支持者/辩护者）。我认为倾听市场并在产品中保持商业导向是可以的，尽管这可能会让某些类型的产品组织中的人感到有些不安。我之所以相信这一点，是因为我认为有很多伟大的业务是建立在 Sales-led motions（销售驱动模式）之上的。我不认同“这代表你不在乎工艺或用户体验”的说法。我认为这两者是可以兼得的。\n\n(01:17:19):\n我热爱销售。我说过，如果我不做现在的职位，那就给我定个业绩指标，让我去做西部大区企业级市场（Enterprise West）的销售。我喜欢销售，但我认为产品团队——这种全行业范围内对“销售驱动”的抵触情绪，我不确定在每个组织中都是健康的。我听了那期播客，我想你们在讨论，你说：“SAP 就是这样的，谁想成为 SAP 呢？” 伙计，现实中有太多的公司梦想成为 SAP。当然，也许是拥有更好的产品、更好的体验、得到行业更多喜爱的 SAP。但它确实是一家极其强大的公司。我认为作为 PM，我们太频繁地对这种巨头公司嗤之以鼻，因为我们希望公司是 Product-led（产品驱动）而非 Sales-led（销售驱动）的。\n\nLenny (01:18:07):\n太精彩了。我不想深入探讨这个话题，因为我不想代表 Marty 的观点发言，但那集节目引发了非常多的辩论，我很高兴这带来了更多关于产品运作方式的观点分享。\n\n(01:18:20):\n我想，为了理解你的核心观点，你是认为：销售驱动的公司也可以很出色，它们可以建立令人惊叹的业务，在这样的公司当 PM 也可以很棒。\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:27):\n是的，而且他们也能做出伟大的产品。\n\nLenny (01:18:30):\n太好了。Claire，在进入我们非常精彩的 Lightning round（闪电问答）之前，你还有什么想分享给听众的吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:39):\n我想说的是，因为我们谈了很多关于 AI 和取代 PM 的话题，但我喜欢销售，我喜欢帮助人们找到工作。所以，如果有什么方式能帮大家找到契合的公司，那是我能量的来源之一。我只是想把这个想法表达出来。这是一件能带给我很多快乐的事情。我收到过很多咨询，“你能帮我进入这家公司吗？你能帮我联系那里吗？” 如果有一种可行的方式能帮你联系到你认为非常适合的公司或职位，那对我来说很有趣，我也非常乐意帮忙。\n\nLenny (01:19:09):\n人们该如何联系你，好让你帮他们 [音质不清 01:19:13]？\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:15):\n我当然在 LinkedIn（领英）上。我的 X（原 Twitter）账号是 @ClaireVo。如果你真的想翻翻“考古”内容，我还有一个非常棒的 TikTok 账号，名字是 ChiefProductOfficer。\n\nLenny (01:19:27):\n太棒了。我们会把这些链接都放在节目介绍里。播客结束时我们还会再提一次。在那之前，欢迎来到我们激动人心的闪电问答环节。准备好了吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:28):\n准备好了。\n\nLenny (01:19:41):\n好。第一个问题：你向别人推荐最多的两三本书是什么？\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:46):\n我非常喜欢《High Growth Handbook》（高增长手册），还有《Scaling People》（如何带人）。我推荐这两本书的原因是，它们对于 80%、90% 的日常领导力和团队扩张问题都提供了可靠的 Playbook（实用手册/行动指南）式的答案。它们是非常棒的参考书，展示了初创公司内部优秀的领导力应该是怎样的，并解决了一些你不需要重新发明轮子的常见问题。小说方面，我一直在推荐《Circe》（瑟曦），它是从瑟曦的角度重新讲述她的故事。这是一本很棒读物，我推荐过的每个人都很喜欢。\n\nLenny (01:20:28):\n是《权力的游戏》里的瑟曦吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:31):\n不，是《奥德赛》里的瑟曦。就是那个 [音质不清 01:20:34] 把男人变成猪的瑟曦。\n\nLenny (01:20:36):\n[音质不清 01:20:36] 看来我缺乏文化修养了。\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:37):\n这书很棒。我的孩子们非常迷恋希腊神话，所以这也是我在我的领域和他们产生交集。\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\n太棒了。前两本书都是 Stripe Press（Stripe 出版社）出版的。向 Stripe Press 致敬。\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:46):\n是的，Stripe Press。\n\nLenny (01:20:47):\n我后面书架上就有这两本，事实上我的笔记本电脑现在就垫在《Scaling People》上面。\n\n(01:20:52):\n下一个问题。最近你非常喜欢的电影或电视节目是什么？\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:57):\n我有孩子，所以没机会去电影院。看电影对我们来说是一场冒险，基本上相当于度假。我看了《Poor Things》（可怜的东西），如果你喜欢大写的“怪异”和大写的“艺术”，我强烈推荐它。至于电视节目，我推荐《Mythic Quest》（神话任务）。大家都爱提《硅谷》，但《神话任务》触及了一些我曾在游戏行业工作的经历，以及我在技术组织中的体验。它有一个女性技术负责人，我觉得非常有趣。我喜欢《神话任务》。\n\nLenny (01:21:31):\n你有没有最喜欢问面试者的面试问题？\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:31):\n我喜欢问候选人他们会如何改进我们的 Business Model (商业模式)。我认为很多 PM (Product Manager，产品经理) 加入时对产品和目标市场都有自己的见解，但实际上并不了解我们赚钱的底层机制、我们的 Unit Economics (单位经济模型) 是怎样的，以及可以如何改进。那些在面试时对商业模式有强烈见解的候选人，通常在我们公司都能取得成功。\n\nLenny (01:21:55):\n那么，一个能让你感叹“喔，这个候选人太棒了”的出色回答，你通常会看重哪些点？\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:59):\n是沿着价值链思考：从我们如何在市场中识别用户，到我们的定价模型是什么样的？他们能推测出我们的底层 Unit Economics (单位经济模型) 或 COGS (Cost of Goods Sold，销货成本) 是什么吗？在整个 Funnel (漏斗) 中，哪些是他们的杠杆点？这实际上是在考量：他们是否有思考商业模式的 Mental Model (心智模型)？他们有没有思考过我们是如何赚钱的（无论是 Top Line 营收还是 Margin 利润率）？以及他们能否识别出可以改进的地方？\n\nLenny (01:22:28):\n太棒了。基本上就是看其是否非常透彻地理解业务。很好。\n\n(01:22:30):\n你最近有没有发现什么特别喜欢的宝藏产品？\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:36):\n好吧，接下来的话可能会让你发笑，因为你聊过那么多豪车，对吧？\n\nLenny (01:22:40):\n是的，我聊过很多非常昂贵的车。\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:42):\n你见过那么多豪车。而我，虽然这不新奇，但我深爱我的 Minivan (厢式旅行车/多功能休旅车)。我是 Minivan 的忠实粉丝。正如我的朋友所说：“这就像开着你的客厅到处跑。”当你有了两个孩子，你知道我想做什么吗？我只想开着我的客厅到处转，包括看《布鲁伊》(Bluey，儿童动画片)。所以，没有 Rivian (美国电动汽车品牌)，没有梅赛德斯-奔驰 (Mercedes-Benz)，我真的很爱我的 Pacifica (克莱斯勒的大捷龙车型)。\n\nLenny (01:23:06):\nPacifica？好，我正想问是哪一款。\n\nClaire Vo (01:23:07):\n但如果说我真正喜爱的硬核汽车产品，我爱 Waymo (谷歌旗下的自动驾驶公司)。我们在旧金山，有这些 Autonomous Vehicles (自动驾驶汽车)。从 App 到车辆到达，从头到尾都是非常美妙的产品体验。它的 Sound Design (声效设计) 很棒，车内很舒适，显示屏也非常出色。现在每当有游客或朋友来旧金山看我，我都会让他们体验一次无人驾驶汽车的往返旅程。我甚至还和 Waymo 团队有过一次客服沟通经历，当时我朋友把 iPhone 落在车里了，客服体验非常棒，24 小时服务。从上到下，都是极佳的 Product Design (产品设计) 和 Service Design (服务设计)。\n\nLenny (01:23:53):\n我最近才刚从 Waymo 的 Wait List (等待名单) 轮到。我非常期待能试一试。早期我曾作为媒体受邀体验，当时车里还有一名公司陪同人员。之后我就再也没拿到过权限，现在终于可以体验了。\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:08):\n尽情享受吧。它真的很棒，是我首选的出行方式。\n\nLenny (01:24:12):\n这就是未来。我们讨论了很多世界正在发生变化的方式，这又是另一个极好的例子。\n\n(01:24:18):\n最后两个问题。你有没有经常回味、或分享给亲友，并觉得在工作或生活中很有用的 Life Motto (人生格言)？\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:26):\n“快胜于对” (Fast beats right)。每当我在“是该反复琢磨一千年试图找到完美方案”还是“果断决策并朝着有信念的方向执行”之间徘徊时，我始终观察到并坚信：最终，速度才是制胜的关键。快胜于对。\n\nLenny (01:24:51):\n最后一个问题。你提到了 TikTok。你在 TikTok 上发布了很多非常棒的内容。根据你的经验，对于想要在 TikTok 上取得成功的人，你有什么建议或窍门可以分享吗？\n\nClaire Vo (01:25:03):\n因为新工作以及冬天孩子生病，我最近稍微冷落了我的 TikTok。这是我的建议，我想你也知道：Consistency (一致性/持续性) 驱动受众增长。也就是说，当我每天都在 TikTok 上发布内容时，粉丝和互动就会增加，算法也会眷顾你。当你停下来，流量也就没了。我认为几乎在所有事情上，坚持不懈都是制胜法宝。\n\n(01:25:27):\n另一条我觉得对任何规模、任何抱负的所谓 Creator (创作者) 都有用的建议是：将内容创作视为 Documentation (记录)，而不是 Creative Generation (创意产出)，这会非常有帮助。我只是喜欢谈论我在工作中的思考，或者在一次有趣的会议、一次有趣的互动后，记录下为什么我觉得那很有趣，或者什么可以做得更好。这便成为了我非常自然的内容输出基础。这套战术对我非常有效，能帮我在业余时间完成创作。\n\nLenny (01:26:00):\n太棒了。鉴于 TikTok 的各种新闻，或许也是时候开始探索 Instagram 了。\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:05):\n我知道。没错。\n\nLenny (01:26:06):\nClaire，在播客开始前，我问你这次的目标是什么，你说希望能帮助到大家。我觉得我们在很多方面都百分之百做到了这一点。再次感谢你的到来。\n\n(01:26:16):\n最后两个收尾问题。虽然之前提过，但帮大家加深下记忆：如果人们想联系你，在哪里可以找到你？听众可以为你做些什么？\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:24):\nLinkedIn、X (原 Twitter)，搜 ClaireVo 连在一起写。还有 TikTok，快让我重新活跃起来吧，关注我，没准我就开始发一些高质量内容了。账号是 @ChiefProductOfficer。\n\nLenny (01:26:37):\n太棒了。那人们可以如何帮助你呢？\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:41):\n互相帮助。这是我最希望看到的。我确实看到目前科技行业正处于一段艰难时期，很多人在找工作。第一，我认为大家应该互相扶持。第二，如果我要向你的听众寻求什么，那就是：如果你拥有一份只需对着屏幕打字、就能凭空创造出产品的职业，请务必意识到这份工作的 Privilege (特权/荣幸) 和快乐，并尝试去享受其中的乐趣。因为很多人都渴望坐在你现在的位置。玩得开心点，珍惜你所拥有的。享受它，并友爱彼此。\n\nLenny (01:27:13):\n非常有意义的临别赠言。Claire，非常感谢你。\n\nClaire Vo (01:27:13):\n谢谢你。\n\nLenny (01:27:18):\n再见，各位。\n\n(01:27:21):\n非常感谢大家的收听。如果你觉得内容有价值，可以在 Apple Podcasts、Spotify 或你喜欢的播客 App 上订阅本节目。同时，也请考虑给我们评分或留下评论，这能实实在在地帮助其他听众发现本播客。你可以在 lennyspodcast.com 找到往期所有节目或了解更多信息。我们下期节目再见。",
