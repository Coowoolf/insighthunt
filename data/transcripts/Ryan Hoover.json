  "en": "[00:00:00] Ryan: I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling, but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry. Um, being a CEO or founder makes it slightly harder, uh, in some ways, because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this space of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You also don't want to subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be a 100% transparent. \n[00:00:28] Lenny: Ryan Hoover is the founder of Product Hunt, which you already know. He's also former product manager, which I did not know. Currently, he's a full-time investor with his fund, the Weekend Fund. He's also an author of a bunch of great block posts and an actual book, called Hooked. He's also really good on Twitter and in my opinion, a very special human being. Ryan Hoover, welcome to the podcast.\n[00:00:52] Ryan: Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I've been reading a lot of your blog posts over, I don't know, past two or three years now, and I'm glad to- to see you do the podcast now. It's cool.\n[00:01:01] Lenny: Thank you, man. That compliment will go straight to my heart. And I will think about it often. I appreciate that. \n[00:01:07] Ryan: Cut- cut that and put it on Twitter. There you go. Yeah. [laughs]\n[00:01:09] Lenny: [That's the clip, we're done. [laughs]\n[00:01:10] Ryan: Yeah. Done, over. [laughs]\n[00:01:14] Lenny: [laughs] This episode's brought to you by RevenueCat.

And what happens when they do?\n[00:02:26] Ashley: Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CMC importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n[00:02:43] Lenny: I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both sign-up conversion and increasing longterm retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n[00:03:01] Ashley: Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and ZORA are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n[00:03:17] Lenny: If you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n[00:03:23] Lenny: You're such a tech celebrity; everybody knows Product Hunt. Everybody knows Ryan Hoover, at least in tech. And I'm curious, how often are you recognized walking around the street, in life, and has there ever been like a super awkward or super hilarious moment of that?\n[00:03:37] Ryan: Yeah, so t- Product Hunt started in late 2013 and quickly got a lot of traction in- in the tech- tech sphere. So, yeah, people in tech, um, might recognize me. People outside of tech, doubt- doubt they recognized me. Um, I actually do wonder subconsciously if I grew my hair out to avoid being recognized. \nUm, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but anyway, it's been a couple years or so growing my hair out and I'm like, ah, I just kinda wanna like disappear sometimes. But, you know, in San Francisco, where everybody's in tech, um, there was a lot of that. And probably the- the, the moment where I was like, \"Oh, this is- this is like a thing,\" uh, it was probably early Product Hunt, uh, I was at- do you remember... I don't know if you know this. Do you know a club, um, called DNA Lounge, and they did something-\n[00:04:19] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04:20] Ryan: ... Called Bootie every Saturday-\n[00:04:20] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04:21] Ryan: ... It was like a mash-up dance party.\n[00:04:22] Lenny: Yeah.\n[00:04:23] Ryan: Yeah. Super well known in the Bay Area. Really fun, fun, uh, kind of experience. Anyway, I remember being with friends and drinking, like- like one does and somebody turns around and says, “Is that the Product Hunt guy?” \n[00:04:33] Lenny: [laughs]\n[00:04:33] Ryan: And that was the first time that sort of happened in that setting where I was like, oh gosh, now I have to like, think about my actions. And I can't just like, be entirely like loose and, you know, relax with my friends. And, um, so anyway, there- there's always pros and cons to those types of things. Um, but you know, it- it definitely is makes me more aware of, I'm already a very, like sometimes anxious and like self-aware person in terms of like my surroundings.\nAnd so when you combine that with, “Oh, these strangers might be watching me,” is not the best thing in the world, but it's okay.\n[00:05:04] Lenny: I've actually gone a little bit through that same experience recently in my, like a much smaller sense where I- with this newsletter and the growth of this thing, there’s been like meetups happening all over the world. And so I've been going to the SF meetups here and there, and it feels very strange to be like, known and people get- they’re like taken pictures with me, like what the- what the hell's going on.\n‘Cause I started this thing as, uh, COVID hit and it was like- everyone's at home, I was just typing on my computer, didn’t have to go anywhere. And as the world has emerged, it's become a new- a new thing I'm dealing with, on a much smaller scale.\n[00:05:35] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Events are events are fun. Um, we threw a bunch of them at- at Product Hunt. Uh, yeah, you- you do a lot of selfies and a lot of like, handshakes and it’s- there's, there's some energy there. I'm an introvert though. So by hour, like three or four, I'm just like, ugh… uh… I need to use the restroom cause I haven't been able to escape and I'm socially exhausted, so, but they are fun.\n[00:05:55] Lenny: I know, uh, exactly what you mean. I am also an introvert and I get so drained doing things like that. I was gonna ask you about that. So yeah. Um, along the same lines, you’re- you're a very public person. You tweet a lot, you share a lot, you do a lot of podcasts and things like that. What's something that people don't know about you?\n[00:06:12] Ryan: Yeah. Um, you're right. I- I probably sh- maybe overshare, uh, on Twitter and other things…\n[00:06:17] Lenny: No, that, that is not what-\n[00:06:18] Ryan: Um, there is a list of [laughs] no, no, I know. I know what you're saying. Um, but there's also a whole series of things that I don't talk about. Um, some of them- well, anyway, I won't, I won't talk about the things I can't talk about.\nUh, but one thing that, um, one thing that most people don't know about- I know there- there's certain juicy things, uh, like everybody has in their life. Um, I recently moved to- well, I guess it's been a year. Um, I moved to Miami about a year ago and, uh, I haven't been talking about it publicly, primarily because I just didn't want to be lumped into, oh, another person moving to Miami.\nLike, I, I don't know. I just, there's no benefit or like, reason for me to do so. Uh, I want my friends there in Miami to know I'm there, but otherwise I don't need the world to know. I guess now they will. Um, that said in Miami, you know, we’re- we're there about two thirds of the year, so I'm actually in California right now.\nUm, as you know, the summer humidity come- comes through Miami and hurricane season. We’re- we're planning to do more of, um- I wouldn't call it nomadic and I wouldn't call it bicoastal per se, but something like that. Where two thirds of the year we’re Miami and then maybe a third were in New York, or LA, or someplace else.\nUm, and I love that. Um, fortunately we have the flexibility, uh, when I say we, my girlfriend, Susie, and I, to just carry our laptops and work anywhere. So it's been- it's been a nice lifestyle kinda shift.\n[00:07:33] Lenny: I did not know that, that is very interesting. Why did you get pulled into Miami? What pulls you there?\n[00:07:39] Ryan: Yeah. You know? Um, so the way I describe ci- cities are kinda like a product. So if you're in the supermarket or- supermarket, I sound like an, old- old person. Ha, if- if you're at a store, you're looking at different products, or if you're online, you're evaluating different products, and they each have like a cost and they have some benefits, um, or values or whatever you- you want to use to describe it.\nAnd for me, each city is kind of like that. And so, you know, in terms of costs, there's cost of living in terms of housing, uh, food, taxes, a bunch of things that go into the cost of living in the city. And then the city provides a lot of benefits and- and things like that. And so in LA- so I was in bay area for ten years, LA for two Miami for one.\nNow, they each have their own pros and cons. They each cost effectively different prices. And so we visited Miami a year and a half ago and we just fell in love with lot- lots of it. Um, we also- it's just cheaper. It's cheaper than the Bay Area. It's cheaper than LA. Um, when- when you kind of count, kinda like all in costs, um, and we had a bunch of friends move there, so we enjoyed the city.\nWe're like, this is good., strong ROI. Uh, this is a good product. Let’s- let's move there. Um, but at the same time, as I mentioned, like- we are traveling and, and exploring other cities. So it’s- it's kind of the best of both worlds for us.\n[00:08:53] Lenny: Very cool. Um, curious how long you last there and how you like it over time. I love Miami. I always have a good time when I go there. And I have many friends living there. Changing topics, a little bit, something that I've noticed you do recently, which is super cool is you offer people the chance to DM you questions that they have about their startup or their journey as a founder.\nAnd you just offer to give 'em free advice. And then sometimes you, tweet the DMs to share that with more folks. I'm curious just how many people have DM’d you because this is such a cool offer, and what have you learned going through this and kind of hearing people's questions?\n[00:09:26] Ryan: I first opened up my DMs- I had 'em closed, which is like traditionally the default on Twitter for a long time. ‘Cause I was like, “Oh, if I open them up, I'll just get a bunch of spam and I don't need another inbox to- to call through.” I opened it up quietly and, um, actually didn't get a lot of spam, uh, surprisingly. Like yeah, people would shill something or promote something, but it wasn't too bad.\nSo I- I left it open and then I forget, one day I was maybe I was like- on the elliptical, bike or the recumbent bike or something. And I was just… I- I tend to get on the bike and just hold my phone up and just do emails and work. And so, um, I just said, “Hey, DM me if you have any questions, any founders, and I'll try and like answer as many as I can.”\nAnd, um, part of my motivation for that was… I don't know, I was just killing time. And the other was, I used to blog a lot. I used to write a lot, um, I don't know, I've written hundreds of blog posts, but not so much anymore. I rarely write anymore. And part of it's because it just takes so long to write.\nAnd sometimes I don't feel like inspired by any topic. It’s- it's sort of like a writer's block. And so I found this also kind of as a means to like, do micro- almost like micro blog posts in a way, uh, where the prompt is the question from somebody else. I don't have to think about the pr- prompt. And then the answer is- is in some ways, a way for me to actually think about that- that topic, almost like refine my own thinking in, in some sense.\nAnd so I started doing that and then I realized, “Well, maybe other people have similar questions, and maybe other people have other answers and other ideas too,” so I would just take a screenshot of my answer and kind of summarize their answer, of course, keeping it anonymous, not sharing anything that would be sensitive. Um, and just put it on Twitter and- you know, it's been fun.\nI do that maybe once every three or four days, I share a new question and answer and, sort of like a… It's like micro blogging in a way, I guess that’s what Twitter is, but like it's a kind of like a real micro-blogging kind of like, uh, um, activity for me.\n[00:11:15] Lenny: Is there anything that's kind of surprised you, or that you've learned from founders? What they ask you about? Like, “Wow, I didn't expect this was gonna be such a common problem or question.”\n[00:11:24] Ryan: I wouldn't say anything like super surprising. However, a lot of people… So, you could do the same thing on Twitter and say, “Hey, AMA, ask me anything in public,” the thing is people are not gonna ask certain things, um, for a lot of reasons. And maybe the biggest surprise was a lot of people are pretty vulnerable.\nThese are strangers, founders who DM me saying, “Hey, I’m- we have three months runway left. We’re running out of money. Here's a situation. What advice do you have?” Or just things that, you know, everyone has to wear this unfortunate mask is kind of the way I- what I used to describe it. This mask in life, in business, where everything is going great.\nAnd you know, you're super confident, there are no problems. You got it all under control. And so the reality is that's not the case. Like [laughs] if you peered inside of almost every single company, it probably looks chaotic in- in different ways. And so I guess- I guess maybe the biggest surprise or thing that I value the most is the authenticity of people willing to share some of these, um, vulnerable moments and questions.\n[00:12:17] Lenny: Awesome. What's interesting about your format is as you were talking, I kind of realized it's very similar to my newsletter format, which I- which I think is part of the reason it worked is it's based on people asking me a question, and then I answer the question, and then-\n[00:12:28] Ryan: It's true. \n[00:12:29] Lenny: … And that ends up forcing you to have like concrete, actionable advice.\nSo you've kind of developed even more interesting way of doing it on Twitter, where it's more focused. So, very smart.\n[00:12:39] Ryan: I've always liked your format by the way, in that you are, um- you're a curator in many sense. Like- yeah, you have a lot of experience and good ideas, but you're not trying to answer all the questions in that you are really pulling in experts in their domain expertise to like find answers or inspiration.\nAnd I've always liked that format because one; it, I think leads to a better- better results, better content, better answers, but also it's arguably easier. Um, like imagine if- if you tried to like write, well, you you're shaking your head almost like it’s-\n[00:13:10] Lenny: Like if I had the answers, I'd be like, “Oh, here you go. I'm done.” You know, the research takes a lot of work and time, but- but I do agree. It ends up being a lot more useful and, and- and valuable. And the reason I did that, just to kind of explain that briefly, is when I left Airbnb, people kept coming to me and asking me like, “Hey, how did Airbnb do this thing?\nHow'd they do that thing.” And I was just like- like, they, they don't know what they're doing. They just did this thing, and who knows if that was the thing that helped them, or if that was the right way of approaching it. So I wanted to do this, like, “What does everyone do? And what seems to be the pattern of the things that work?” And that kind of led to this approach.\nAnd it takes a lot of time. Especially this new series that we're gonna chat a bit about that I worked on where it's just like endless interviews and chats and researchers and watching interviews. But yeah, it works out.\n[00:13:54] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. You- you, how many hours actually, do you put into like a typical essay?\n[00:13:59] Lenny: Oh, a reverse question. Uh, I would say the- \n[00:14:02] Ryan: Yeah, I don’t know if I'm supposed to ask you questions, [laughs] but I'm curious.\n[00:14:04] Lenny: This is banned. [laughs] No, it's cool. I say- I'd say the, uh, median post is about 10 hours. It's like, maybe I kind of work on it through the week. So maybe, like a few days through the week, but the most epic posts take hundreds and hundreds of hours that I kind of work on behind the scenes as I work on the weekly posts.\nSo there's a wide range. Some posts take like three hours and sometimes those do very well, much better than expected.\n[00:14:30] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. I- that's exactly going back to my, my point about like- it takes a long time to write content that you're proud of. Um, I’m also just very particular about words, uh, for better or worse. And so I- the first draft actually is maybe like 20 or 30% of the time. And then the rest is refining it and getting feedback and everything else.\n[00:14:48] Lenny: That's exactly how I find it. The question I wanted to ask is, startups are so freaking hard… they almost always fail. It's always just like, “Oh my God, this is… Why am I doing this to myself?? My general advice to founders is like, don't start a company, unless you just like, can't not start a company because it's so hard.\nWhat's your take there? What do you think? What do you advise founders for when they're thinking about, should I start a company? Should I not start a company? Which- how should I approach this?\n[00:15:15] Ryan: I do- I do spend time, ironically, like. challenging founders sometimes when they're thinking about raising or thinking about an idea to- to not raise. Um, people who are in tech, uh, especially, are certain bubbles [laughs] of tech, that’s the default. It's like, “The first thing I do, I have an idea, now let's go raise money.” \nAnd we've gone through some like pretty massive bull cycles where that- that was possible for a lot of people. But it's a huge decision. So with- with Product Hunt, it was a side project in the beginning. It wasn't actually intended to be a startup at all, but in the beginning, you know, it was a newsletter, then it was a website and it was about four to five months before we even incorporated.And we got a lot of traction. \nSo, it was during that time, I was really just thoughtful around, \"Should we raise? Do I wanna work on this for many, many years? What's the opportunity? Is this even a venture backable like idea?\" Like all those questions were circulating in my mind for a while. And this is also in a time when the market was pretty, was similarly bullish. This is, uh, end of 2013, early 2014. And investors were- were using Product Hunt to reach out to me, and they were sort courting- courting me, and um, kinda doing that whole song and dance to invest, but I- I just wasn't sure if I wanted to. And so, I don't know, I think a lot of the- those decisions, they're very personal and contextual. However, I think it's super important that founders see a line of sight to work on this for ... I think my rule of thumb is a decade, just do you see yourself working on this for a decade?\nAnd maybe it's not a decade that you actually work on it. It probably won’t, it either, it'll probably fail before then as most startups do, but I think it's a good litmus test for yourself to be like, “Do I actually care about this enough? Am I, am I really stoked to work on this for many, many years?” But then, you know, the other thing is, I think a lot of people also think “I need to start a company. I need to start a startup.” \nAnd they skip to that step without just tinkering and building and, you know, Product Hunt, we called it, not even a side project, we called it an experiment. And that framing I think, is for me, has always been helpful because it's an experiment is really not about success. Of course you want it to be successful, but the goal is not success.\nI put that in quotes, it's really to learn and, you know, see if people want this thing and then kind of adapt. And so like an experimental mindset is helpful and I think a valuable way to start. It even goes back to like, why I named the fund Weekend Fund. It's like, what are you tinkering with on the weekends?\nYou know? And how can you be more curious and experimental and kind of your exploration of new startup ideas?\n[00:17:43] Lenny: I didn't know that's why it was called the Weekend Fund. I thought it's because you worked on it on the weekends, or is it both?\n[00:17:48] Ryan: [laughs] It had like multiple meetings. Yeah, it was- three meanings: One was- was that I started Weekend Fund when I was building Product Hunt. So it took a lot of pitch- pitches and calls with founders on the weekends. Two, I think a lot of great ideas start by like metaphorically speaking, nights and weekends, um, kind of side projects or ideation.\nAnd then the third reason was it was like more friendly. I don't know, I didn't wanna name it. Hoover capital or something like sterile, wanted it to be -\n[00:18:14] Lenny: Wait, that's an awesome name. Hoover capital. Wow. \n[00:18:18] Ryan: …Capital. Uh I don't know. I, I feel well.\n[00:18:23] Lenny: Yeah, it's not on brand,\n[00:18:24] Ryan: Yeah. \n[00:18:25] Lenny: But it’s powerful- \n[00:18:25] Ryan: Um, yeah. [laughs] \n[00:18:28] Lenny: As you know, I asked people on Twitter what questions they would want to ask you. And so I'm gonna inter splice these questions as we go through this. And, you just touched on Product Hunt and fundraising, and I'm curious if you were to go back and- and do it again.\nWould you raise money for Product Hunt, or would you not?\n[00:18:44] Ryan: Great question. So at the time, this is also the thing I ask [laughs] founders is why do you need to raise money? Like, what is it for? Surprisingly, some people like- I don't know, like they don't have a clear answer. For me, It was pretty obvious. Like we needed- we needed to hire, we needed people. Like, I- I didn't have personal capital to- to pay people.\nThere was an alternative, uh, reality where we actually built an open source. I was thinking like, “Is that possible?” Like we're building something for the tech community. I'm sure a lot of people would love to work on this. Could we build it in an open source way, but that like- that's really hard to do.\nAnd when you're building a company, you probably don't want to innovate on too many things, um, including like essentially how to build a product and build a team. Anyway, to answer your question, if I- I don't, I don't know what the right at the time raising money was the right decision because I- I wanted to hire and I didn't have personal capital.\nThere really weren't any other realistic options. I don't think. Today I could get further with my own- I'm not super wealthy and I'm super illiquid, but I have at least enough money where I could have funded, you know, maybe a year of development with this very small team. So today it might be a little bit different in which I might not raise venture capital because Product Hunt isn't the type of company that needs to raise a ton of money.\nIt's also one which is not, um, doesn't have like direct competitors in the sense of like an Uber and Lyft situation where raising is actually like kind of mandatory and you sort of have to build a massive war chest to compete. So there- there is a scenario where if I had more money, then maybe I wouldn't have raised venture capital. But yeah… there- there's a lot of other like decisions and other things that probably, uh, bigger mistakes I think I made. Um, not that raising money was a mistake by any means. It was, I think the right decision then, but yeah- there's a lot of learnings in hindsight's 2020.\n[00:20:31] Lenny: The point you made about like, you just needed money to like run the thing. I think that's so, so overlooked when people bash the idea of fundraising for a startup that maybe didn't need it. Like you just need money. Like you don't have just money to burn and go into debt. That makes sense to raise some money and see where this thing goes without really knowing where it's gonna go.\n[00:20:49] Ryan: Mm-hmm .Yeah, especially if it’s… I mean, I think it's very important to raise- raise from people who are aligned with you too. Meaning like, “Why does this person want to, whether it's an angel or a fund, invest in your fund?” Um, sorry, not fund… your company. When you go down a certain path, when you raise a series A, B, C, like you have different expectations and when you raise your proceed or seed round. So I think also understanding like, you know, what you're signing up for is super important.\n[00:21:16] Lenny: What kind of treadmill you’re- you're getting on.\n[00:21:18] Ryan: Yes. Yeah. ‘Cause you can't get off. I mean you can, but it's not like a company… I always say like when you're at a company, you can put in two weeks, notice one month notice. You can move on. As- as a founder or CEO, you can’t. Like, you really can't. Um, now you technically can… But you can’t, it- it's really, hard, um, to, to exit. \n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. I look at the Airbnb founders. Who've been doing this for 15 years. Like, you know, they're doing well in life, but they also… it's very hard to leave.\n[00:21:46] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. Coming back to Product Hunt, people launch their product on Product Hunt, that's the thing, and I'm curious; founders are always so obsessed with launching and the power of a launch, and \"We gotta launch.” Do you think launches are worth it for a company? Is that something founders should be spending time on or is it often better just to not even spend time on that and just build slowly?\n[00:22:07] Ryan: Yeah, I- I always kinda ... Whenever I share like my perspective on stuff, I- I always enforce it always like it kinda depends, which is kinda like it sounds like a cop-out answer. So, it's- it's more ... My answers are usually more nuanced, and the thing about launching is- is going back to why are you raising money. What's the goal? Same thing. Why are you launching? And the the- a lot of people default to things like customer acquisition, \"Oh, I wanna acquire customers.\" But sometimes that's actually not- it's not useful. Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch.\nSo, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership. So, as you launch, you might also encounter more partnerships, more opportunities. I think there's a serendipitous effect of launching. So, I think understanding like what are the priorities of the business. Like if you- it might not be customer acquisition at all, it might be, \"We need to recruit and hire. Let's launch, so we can get the word out. Hopefully that will help land, you know, our next, you know, engineers, designers, or whoever.\" \nAnd then I also see there's like these little ti- side benefits too of launching that we see a lot through Product Hunt. One of them is team morale. And this- this might- I think this is overlooked. And I- I would also encourage [laughs] founders not to get their team too, um, I would say- you- you shouldn't be motivated to launch a product just to get like the likes on Twitter and the upvotes on Product Hunt, but there is a gr- like a powerful team morale and kinda building moment there where you can all celebrate what you've accomplished and what you built and put it out to the world. And, you know, somebody on the team can share, you know, the- the- the Product Hunt launch or, you know, some Tech Crunch article with their- their mom. And, you know, like that seems like a trivial kind of meaningless thing, but it actually matters for a lot of people. And then the other thing is SEO. So, if SEO's like a part of your strategy, having articles, positive articles, having a- a positive Product Hunt launch, things like that can also be helpful.\n[00:24:21] Lenny: That's awesome. I love that last point about morale. I- I hadn't thought about that. You've seen probably more launches than other person out there. How many launches of startups would you estimate you've kind of like seen or been [laughs], I don't know, an observer of? If that makes any sense. \n[00:24:38] Ryan: Um, I should look at our database on Product Hunt and see how many launches we've had 'cause it's gonna be a subset of that. I mean by seen, I- I- some of it's very high-level, but tens of thousands over the years.\n[00:24:48] Lenny: Okay, so when you think about that, do you have any sense of what correlates with a great launch versus just like an okay launch? What- what do founders miss with how they launch?\n[00:25:01] Ryan: Yeah, I mean the- this goes back to college and- and the a- you know, I won't go on my own rant about education, but in, uh, you know, English class and writing class, a lot of teachers teach people to write with big words and fill pages of content and basically not speak like a human. And so, one- one thing I've noticed among founders and just people in general is they tend to write like a- a PR person and not like a human and not like, you know, the- the way that I kind of describe kind of a frame of- of writing, maybe your tagline for Product Hunt, um, or for your launch in general is like how- how do your customers or your users describe your product to other people? Or another frame is how do you describe it to your friends? Like when you're just, you know, hanging out, like how do you describe what you do, what you built, what it's for? And that language, I think, resonates with people because it feels way more authentic.\nAnd the people that use buzzwords and- and vague language, it just doesn't click. People see right- people are sick of the PR [laughs] speech. And so, I think the language and the microcopy, copyrighting matters so much. And then there's a lot of other things around like we should go more to the product and less about the launch. Like do you really understand who you're building for? And do you understand how to communicate the value prop- like what is it in the mind of user? There's sort of a lot of, I guess, more strategic kinda like decisions that go into that- that, uh, before the launch.\n[00:26:22] Lenny: Imagine each of those, uh, points can be its own podcast and block post. [laughs] One of the questions that people asked me on Twitter was the classic, \"How do I get to number one on Product Hunt?\" So, my question to you is I know that's like ... There's not gonna be a silver bullet. Is there like a guide that you point people to that's like, \"Here, just follow this advice,\" and/or, I don't know, two or three key things that you just gotta get right.\n[00:26:44] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, so in the posts below, there's actually a link- links to a bunch of guides and FAQs and things like that. So, it's really easy to find like sort of the best practices there. The team also has like this checklist. So, once you launch, there's like a checklist of things, recommendations or tips. And I'm actually forgetting like what each of them are specifically right now, but some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief. Some people write essays, which might be interesting, but the reality is most consumers, especially people on Product Hunt, you know, they're- they're flipping through a bunch of ideas. They're looking for things that spark their curiosity and interest.\nAnd they probably not particularly interested in reading like an [laughs] essay, you know, from- from the makers. So, keeping that short, I think, is helpful. And then another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort. It could be like, \"Here's the before and after with our product,\" or \"Here's the evolution of what this product can do.\" There's many different ways to approach it, but like a really clean, you know, visually interesting story, um, can also be a great way to like capture people's interest in what you built.\n[00:28:21] Lenny: Awesome. That was very tactical and helpful. If you were to launch something on Product Hunt yourself, and it wasn't like hunted by Ryan Hoover, do you think you would get to the top?\n[00:28:30] Ryan: [laughs] I- I mean I don't know. It's- it's funny because if you ... We should do some like historical analysis on Product Hunt 'cause I'd be curious to know the actual numbers, but it varies all over the board. So, some people, they ask me, \"Hey, like I don't know, is Product Hunt like ... Do B2B companies do well there?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, like a lo- m- probably more B2B companies than B2C companies actually,\" and so you see, you know, seemingly boring companies that tap into something that- that- that people find useful or resonate- resonates with them, um, can go to the top. And then you also see the weird, wacky stuff, you know, the- the silly apps also hit the top. So, I don't know, it really varies.\nAnd sometimes it's also driven by like the almost like the zeitgeist, like what do people find interesting right now? Like what's sparking people's interest? Because Product Hunt, on one side, you are potentially attracting people who might be future users and customers, partners, and so on, but it's also just a general kind of like zeitgeist of the early adopter tech community. Like what are they interested in? What do they find compelling in general?\n[00:29:34] Lenny: Got it. Okay, so I have a bunch of questions from Twitter that people [laughs] wanted to ask you. And so, let me ask you a few of those, and they're kind of a little bit all over the place, but we'll see- we'll see where this goes. Jessica Toye, who's a- she's a PM at Angel List, she's actually a friend. We were together at Airbnb. She asked a great question.\n[00:29:53] Ryan: Yeah. Jess- Jess is awesome. She- shout-out to Jess, she's like been super helpful on the Angel List side, so she's awesome.\n[00:29:59] Lenny: Amazing. Okay, she's the best. She asked what you learned as a PM that has helped you in your venture career.\n[00:30:06] Ryan: Yeah, um, yeah, so my- my background is, uh, marketing and then product management. Pretty quickly, uh, used to work in the gaming industry, which is like, I think, an- an awesome industry. Really hard to make it in that industry, but like amazing place to learn, and no, no, uh, I have so many biases, so I have to like be cautious of that, but I- I- having a product background, I think, is one of the most important aspects of early stage startup investing, meaning oftentimes, when you're building a new company, there are a lot of risks and there's a lot of important things to- to nail, but it all ultimately comes down to the product that you're building. And so, I think having a product management or a product background is helpful. And one, having more, I guess, perspective in evaluating different ideas and- and arguably more important, uh, how the founder thinks about things. So, it might be less about me evaluating the- the- the market need for this particular idea, but it's what's the thought process and how did this founder come to these product ideas and these insights. And so, I think having a product management background is helpful for that, and I don't know, I also just find it really fun to jam on product with founders. And when it's early, early days, there- there's more opportunity to create some sort of impact or, you know, help shape the product in- in a slight way.[00:31:20] \nLenny: Awesome. Basically if you're a PM, you've got a lot of the skills that you need to be a founder.\n[00:31:24] Ryan: Founder and- and arguably, investor, um, as well.\n[00:31:27] Lenny: Oh, and that's right. Okay. So, uh, Leo of Sousa Ventures, who's also an awesome dude, uh, he asked if you could go back and-\n[00:31:35] Ryan: I saw Leo in, uh, Miami, uh, not long ago.\n[00:31:39] Lenny: Oh yeah. He moved to Miami too. Oh my God. Everyone's over there. Okay, so [laughs], uh, he asked if you could go back and build Product Hunt again, what would you do differently? We talked a bit about this, but anything else?\n[00:31:50] Ryan: Yeah. Um, I've been thinking a lot about this actually lately. And, um, yeah, I mean there's a few things. Uh, one, Product Hunt, in the very beginning, and still today, is very much focused on tech, and there was, at one point, ambition to expand beyond tech into all different types of, you know, categories of products. So, you know, we experimented with podcasts actually, podcast discovery.\nWe experimented in video game discovery, we experimented with book discovery, and the thesis there was, \"Okay, this could be actually discovery platform for all of these communities to discover all these different products,\" and I think there was a lot of good ideas in that. However, I severely underestimated how difficult it would be to do two things: one, the product experience on Product Hunt is very different than how you would wanna discover video games or maybe, in the future, fashion and a bunch of other types of products out there.\nAnd two, it's really difficult to translate a community and expand into other communities. Like some- some have done it. Like Reddit is maybe a great example, where Reddit has this massive [laughs] long tail of, you know, every kinda community you can imagine, but very few companies and platforms can actually do that. So, that's one- one regret is we should not have tried to expand horizontally. We should've just focused entirely vertically and- and served the tech community, you know, better and- and with more things, which is effectively what we're doing now. Another regret, another thing I would've changed is I would've- I would've actually tried to monetize and generated revenue sooner. We- we raised a seed in a series A and we had capital to grow, and we didn't actually try to make money until after we required Angel List.\nAnd my thinking at the time was, and to some extent, there's some truth to this, is like everything you prioritize is at the cost of something else. You know, you- you're essentially taking focus from one thing and directing it to something else. And what mattered most was growth and to grow the community, but what I really should've done is dedicated maybe 10% of our focus on revenue generation because, you know, it was- once we started generating revenue, we- we did so very quickly, and we go to cashflow, break even, I wanna say a year, maybe 12 months after we started generating revenue. So, if we would've started in 2014 to make some money, we coulda been cashflow, break even, you know, maybe 2015, 2016, which would've just given us a lot of flexibility in kind of owning your own destiny and proving out some of the business model itself. \nAnd then like the last thing, uh, I've been thinking about this lately is- is delegation is- is a classic founder challenge. You know, I- I'm just generally a controlling person. That's something I'm working on. And it's really hard sometimes when I have such strong opinions, and I'm very particular about certain things, uh, fully delegate and fully trust everybody. Not necessarily- we have an amazing team. Like I worked with some amazing people, still people that are Product Hunt today like six, seven years later. It wasn't anything about the skills of the team. It was just my own trust and my own delegation, and what I should've done is, you know, up until shortly before I left, I was editing the newsletter every morning, for example, like every morning. I was waking up, you know, 5 a.m., 5:30 a.m., editing the newsletter. I mean that's just kinda silly, you know, to be doing that so many years later after starting.\n[00:35:02] Lenny: I totally get that drive to just make sure everything you're putting out and that your company's putting out is topnotch. I- I have the same feeling, and it is hard to [laughs] let go and just like, \"That's not perfect, but I'm gonna- I'm gonna be okay with that, a few other things.\"\n[00:35:16] Ryan: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's- it's really hard, and I think it's a tendency that is, uh, in some ways, it's- it's good in that you care so much about the product as a founder. You care so much about what you're building. You care so much about the details, uh, and you need that kind of like almost OCD-like, uh, behavior, however, you also just can't scale yourself nor are you the best person at everything. So, I- I don't know. With hindsight I'm like, \"All right, I should've delegated more. I should've trusted people more.\" And yeah, they'll- there will be more mistakes. I make mistakes all the time, but at the end, it's gonna be way net positive because you kind of have to [inaudible 00:31:30] your company anyway.\n[00:35:54] Lenny: It’s a good segue to a question Harry Stubbings asked that he finds interesting always. What's the most painful lesson that you've learned and, but that you're also happy about to have gone through?\n[00:36:05] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there's ... I actually- I recently in the past couple weeks, wrote a blog post, that I'm not really able to publish 'cause it's- it's basically when you- there's certain things I wanna share that it- it- it can make things challenging and complicated for others. So, I didn't wanna put anyone else in- in a pickle. So, someday maybe I'll publish this post, but to speak more vaguely about it, like there's some hard- really hard times in Product Hunt, like we- we have all faced in- in different ways as founders, not even just as founders [laughs], just as people. Oh, yeah, there's some times where I felt physically ill, many different moments in- in Product Hunt. And um, it was just really tough, and you know, you- I don't know if- I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry.\nBeing a CEO or a founder makes it slightly harder in some ways because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this face of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You- you also don't wanna subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be 100% transparent. So, it's- it's a struggle because, I think, I h- I don't know, I value authenticity so much, and I- I kinda like thrive around people who are authentic, however, there's this like tension with- with being a founder or CEO where you can necessarily share everything. So, anyway, everyone's gone through hardship building a company. You know, the positive aspect of that is like if- I- I think, hopefully growing some empathy for founders who are going through hard situations. I think it's made me a little bit stronger, maybe thicker-skinned for certain things. It just provided more- more perspective, you know, into the company kind of like building journey.\n[00:37:41] Lenny: Okay, listen to this.

Yeah. It's kind of y- y- like a lot of things, you know, uh, what doesn't break you makes you stronger to some extent. So, it didn't break me, uh, it just scarred me a little bit but didn't break me. [laughs]\n[00:38:52] Lenny: And turned you into the Ryan Hoover that we- that we have today.\n[00:38:55] Ryan: Yeah. For better or worse.\n[00:38:57] Lenny: [laughs] Maybe one last question from- from Twitter, Twitteratis. From Sandeep. He just wanted to know what- what have you found matters most to you or mattered most to you in life and in business versus what you thought would matter most?\n[00:39:09] Ryan: Yeah, um, still figuring it out. I'm- I'm- I'm still asking the- the old stereotypical questions like, \"What- what the heck is the meaning of life? Like what am I here for?\" [laughs] All those things.\n[00:39:19] Lenny: Let me know when you figured it out. \n[00:39:20] Ryan: Yeah. And maybe, maybe there is no answer. Maybe the question is, is actually, um, doesn't matter. So I mean, if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out.\nYeah. And maybe- maybe there is no answer. Um, maybe the question is- is actually it doesn't matter. Um, so I mean if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out. I mean I think in- in life, some of the things that I've reflected on is, uh, so damn cliché, but sometimes when cliches are true is like friends and authentic relationships have been, I don't know, they just matter so much, I think. And the older I get too, it's less about, I don't know, I care less about having a lot of friends and more about a few deep, close relationships. And I don't know, I feel like that's very different than like middle school Ryan or like, you know, when you're in- on the playground metaphorically speaking, like where everyone's tryin' to be popular and, you know, meet a lot of people. And even- even joining and- and being, you know, uh, in San Francisco in the tech community, you wanna meet a lot of people and network and all- do all those things, that- that's less interesting to me and less important.\nAnd then, more on the business side, the thing I've been thinking about is like, and I think this is obvious to a lot of people, but I think there's some nuances to it, which is momentum matters so much. And momentum is reflexive in that, you know, high momentum leads to more high momentum. Low momentum leads to more low momentum because there's this energy that- that kinda goes through companies where, when there is momentum, when people are shipping, when things are going well, other people feel that energy, and they wanna do the same, but in the reverse, someone who might be slowing things down, not shipping, not really performing very well, that actually does the reverse too. It- it might lead other people to- to feel less motivated or care less. And so, I don't know, momentum is- is this weird thing that, you know, you- arguably, it's one of the most important things in early-stage startups. And of course, it's an- an input to a lot of things, uh, but it's just so important to nail.\n[00:41:00] Lenny: Mark Andreessen talks about that- that last point that ... There's like a word for it that I forget, that a company is either becoming a gravity and pulling in all resources and funding and attention or losing it. And it's really important as a company to know which one of those are you, and as an investor, you often wanna bet on the company that's just like they're just becoming the center of gravity here, and there's not a lot you can do to change that once they reach a certain point.\n[00:41:24] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean the- it also mirrors with like the power law of investing where it's- it's, in most people's situation, it's one company is returning ... You can invest in 100 companies, and one of those companies is probably gonna return three to five X in the returns of all the others, maybe combined in some cases. So, it's- it's wild.\n[00:41:45] Lenny: On the first point that you made earlier about cliches and platitudes, it reminds me, Michael Pollan has this point that he makes that like cliches and platitudes are cliches and platitudes because we've heard 'em so many times but that- because they're true. People just say 'em because they're so true. And as much as we don't wanna hear them, like there's a reason that we hear them again and again. Uh, I had a similar recognition when I was on a little psychedelic journey where I'm just like, \"Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need, man.”\n[00:42:15] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah.\n[00:42:16] Lenny: Okay, people have figured that out. But I was like, I feel that, I feel that right now. But it's true. That's why people- that's why f- [laughs] we're like, \"Okay, shut up. I heard that. That's in a song.\"\n[00:42:25] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah, it's- I was listening to- to a podcast, uh, about someone who was basically describing like psychedelics as a gateway into like meditation and- and everything and how it can be one of those things that makes people ... It- it- a lot of people who take psychedelics come across as another hippie cliché like person who like repeats the same things we've all heard many, many times, but there's a reason why there's a pattern there. And, you know, he describes like psychedelics as- as one way to feel that and learn that- that feeling that you can't achieve with- with meditation, you know, with experience.\n[00:42:56] Lenny: Yeah, I think Sam Harris talks about this where you could either meditate for five, 10 years to work your way up the mountain towards, you know, enlightenment, or you could just take some psychedelics, visit it for a little moment, see what it's like, and then [laughs]- and then-\n[00:43:09] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:43:09] Lenny: be motivated to, to work on getting there more naturally\n[00:43:12] Ryan: Yeah.\n[00:43:13] Lenny: This is a good time to play a little game that I invented just for you. Okay, so you're the founder of Product Hunt. Okay. And, on Product Hunt, people up vote ideas that they like best. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you two options and you tell me which you'd rather— which you'd up vote and it'll make sense once we get going. [laughs]\nThat sound good.\n[00:43:33] Ryan: Okay, cool. Let's do it.\n[00:43:35] Lenny: Okay. TikTok or Instagram Reels?\n[00:43:38] Ryan: And, and is context setting, are these within the context of products? I, I like and know, or\n[00:43:43] Lenny: Products you would choose to use that you like better... yeah. Not like which will do business— better business. Yeah. \n[00:43:50] Ryan: Okay. Okay. Got it. TikTok's for me. It's funny, reels, I kind of joke with, with Susie, my girlfriend, I joke that it's like, reels is like, TikTok, but like two weeks late.\nUh, it's not entirely true, but I feel like I see a lot of TikTok videos on Instagram reels. Like after, you know, weeks after they've been published.\n[00:44:08] Lenny: We'll see, I have some friends that work on reels and I'm excited to see where they go. Okay, next- LaCroix or Topo Chico.\n[00:44:15] Ryan: Ooh, this is a tough because I- I- I'm generally a La Croix kinda person, but Topo Chico, I like the bottle. So, when Topo Chico's available, I'll go Topo Chico. I'm sorry, La Croix.\n[00:44:26] Lenny: [laughs] I- I totally get that. My wife's a huge Topo Chico fan. We have many, many [laughs] bottles. They're beautiful. They've- kind of changed a bit. They're like super clear now, they used to have a little, a little tint.\n[00:44:36] Ryan: Hmm. \n[00:44:37] Lenny: Very important topics. Yeah. Okay. Next, next up, Bay Area or Los Angeles?\n[00:44:43] Ryan: Uh, Los Angeles. Although, it depends on the- the, so here's my goals, if- if I was, you know, a new college grad or someone young and- and new in kind of the tech industry, definitely San Francisco. You'll create a lot of serendipity. You'll- you'll meet a lot of people, but from a lifestyle perspective, LA. Um, LA, I just find more enjoyable, weather's better, there's hiking, housing is cheaper. So, LA today, San Francisco, 10 years ago.\n[00:45:09] Lenny: Very nuanced dancer. I knew you were gonna say LA, and so, next is East Side LA or West Side LA?\n[00:45:16] Ryan: I don't know. We- we lived in Hollywood up in the hills for a while. So, I don't know if that's East or West, but wherever that is, big fan.\n[00:45:24] Lenny: I guess that's West, right? It's not near the water. That's a really good question. Hollywood Hills, all right, that'll be a third [laughs] option. Okay, electric bike or regular bike.\n[00:45:34] Ryan: Nothing against electric bikes, but I feel like if- if your goal is to get exercise, then just get a regular bike, but I don't have either. I have a- a, um, recumbent bike at home that I use for exercise. The reason why it's recumbent and not like a Peloton where you sit up is 'cause I can do emails and work [laughs] because while I'm exercising.\n[00:45:53] Lenny: Wow. Very productive. Okay. Next, dark mode or light mode?\n[00:45:58] Ryan: Light mode, I've never used dark mode like ever. Actually I take that back. Tweet Deck is the only dark mode kind of app that I use. But- \n[00:46:06] Lenny: Wow. \n[00:46:07] Ryan: I don't know. If- if a founder is prioritizing dark mode before they have product market fit too, it's like a big red flag for me. That's a little bit of a hot take. Some people are gonna hate me for that, but I don't know. I don't think dark mode matters for like 99% of people.\n[00:46:22] Lenny: Wow. Big, big, hot take. What if they just go dark [laughs] and there's no light mode. Does that count against them?\n[00:46:28] Ryan: Uh, Yeah, that's fine. As long as it's just one mode, um, it's the teams that prioritize all these, like small things that don't matter before the product is actually like useful for people or, or that that's, that is where I like my product manager hat comes in and I'm like, is this like the highest on your priority list?\nI don't know. Now big asterisks, it's all contextual. Sometimes. Like the audience you're building for really cares about dark mode. Like if you're building for developers, maybe you need dark mode, or, or some version of it, but, but yeah, I'm, I'm light mode.\n[00:46:57] Lenny: Awesome. Okay. [laughs] Did not expect that, love it. Okay, two more. Wash the dish right away or let it soak in the sink?\n[00:47:04] Ryan: [laughs] Um, I'm looking at the sink over here. There might be dishes in there, so that'll be my answer. I got a bad habit.\n[00:47:11] Lenny: No, I think there's- there's power in letting it soak. I get it. I respect that.\n[00:47:15] Ryan: [laughs] That’s what I'll tell Susie next time. There's power. Lenny said there's power in soaked dishes.\n[00:47:20] Lenny: There's physics. It's soaking. Okay. Last one, Web3 or Web5?\n[00:47:25] Ryan: Mm, uh, I don't know what happened to Web4, so I don't know, maybe- maybe we'll split the difference, so I'm gonna go Web4.\n[00:47:31] Lenny: Okay. We did it. [laughs] That was the inaugural addition of which would you rather up vote? Amazing. You killed it.\n[00:47:38] Ryan: There you go go. I like this. All right. It's kind of a fun, this could, this could be a fun little segment, I think for a lot of things.\n[00:47:45] Lenny: Yeah. It'll plug Product Hunt. It'll be great. We'll see [laughs] where this goes. This replaced my lightning round, which I experiment with. Okay. But actually I have other questions I want to get through before we, before I let you go. If that's cool.\nThere's kinda two topics. One is around consumer startups and just a few things that I've been learning there and then angel investing and then- and then we wrap.\nSo around consumer. By the time this post comes out, I'll have released some portions of the series that I'm working on, on kickstarting and scaling consumer business. And there's a few things I've learned there that I just wanted to get your take on. One is that, and we talked a bit about this just like 99% of consumer apps seem to just like, not work, especially if they're venture scale, if they raise money, just like just a reminder of how hard consumer is like, when is the last consumer app that really took off.\nAnd so I just wanted to get your thoughts— is what's your take there? What should founders do that are starting a consumer company?\n[00:48:40] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's tough. I mean there's- there's obviously consumer is pretty broad, so there's like different levels of difficulty, I think. Um, the consumer social or gaming, like games, building games, is probably like the- the- the hardest and the one filled with the most failures. And I think a lot of that is because, I think a few things, I think one monetization is generally harder than like a B2B company. Historically, a lot of it's been like advertising driven, and to do that, you have to first get to massive scale for advertisers to really care. And then you have to, you know, double it and double it and double it [laughs] again. So, monetization is super tough, versus a B2B company, it's like people have a problem, they have a need, they are willing to give you money, you know, on day- day one.\nThe other thing about consumer that's tough is you're- you're always fighting different, essentially you're fighting for attention. And so, you might be some consumer social company, but you're- you're kind of like competing with Netflix too, which isn't in your direct domain, but like people could be watching Netflix, or they could be using your product or- or your social app, let's say. So, now you're competing with so many different things. Many of those are incumbents where the consumer also has like built-in habits, routines. Like this is a big- big part about consumers too is eventually you wanna be like an internal trigger in someone's mind where they- they just, without even thinking, they go and use your product or services for some reason. Usually, you don't start that way. You need like external triggers to like pull people in, but eventually you have to get to that point. So, how do you overcome those internal triggers they have for other services, other products? It's really, really hard. \nAnd- and then I think a lot of it is, um, like B2B companies, usually you- you have a clear like problem that you're solving. And you could talk to customers, you could understand what are their current behaviors, what- what solutions are they using now, what do they like about them, what do they not like about them whereas, consumer, there's a little bit of that, but it's- it's fuzzier. You know, if you take, um, like Twitter and you kind of even ask someone like, \"Why do you use Twitter and like w-\" people will have different answers that are all kind of like fuzzy. And they ultimately tend to come down to some sort of like innate human desire. Like it could be, uh, for Twitter, it could be about like, \"I wanna be informed with what's happening in the world,\" or it could be, \"I want to feel less lonely or connected to more people,\" or something like that whereas, if you go to, let's say DocuSign, I think is a great example, of a B2B company, it's like super simple. [laughs] \nIt's like a- a way to get legal docs signed online. That's- that's what it does. It's a thing that people have to do. It's very clear like what it solves. And so, B2B's just like easier to navigate that idea maze. And so, with consumer, you- your- your first blog post on this topic touches a lot on the idea side. And I- I, a lot of it resonated with me, especially the- the insight piece. Like what is- what is the insight that you, as a founder, have to build this thing? Because I think it's really hard to build a consumer company without some sort of unique insight, maybe impossible. And you can get that in many different ways. It could be through your own experiences. I used to write like a problem journal. Like just when things annoyed me or when things were like less efficient, I would write it down as like a note. And I didn't try to solve it. I didn't- didn't say, \"Oh, here's the solution.\" I was just like, \"This is annoying.\" \nLike, in San Francisco, one example is a lot of people don't have laundry like in their unit. So, I'm like, \"That's kind of annoying. Like that's a problem. Maybe there's a solution out there.\" So, things like that. And I know, there's- there's- there's a bunch of different ways, like, uh, y- your- your blog post does a better summary, I think, of like the different ways different companies like ideated and came up with their ideas, but yeah, many different ways to navigate it but needs an insight of some sort.\n[00:52:09] Lenny: Awesome. I hadn't heard that, u- u- uh, that pr- problem journal idea. I was gonna ask you if you have any suggestions for how to come up with a startup idea, and that's a really interesting one. Is there- yeah, so I guess it'd be cool to hear where that came from and what that led to? Or if there's anything else you found to be useful around that?\n[00:52:23] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, the problem journal is one. And again, like I think it's helpful, not to try to come up with the solution, but just write- just simply write down the problem you- you observed or experienced. Another one I think's interesting is just to like immerse yourself in different communities. Ideally, like maybe like seemingly niche or weird long tail communities. It doesn't have to be that necessarily, but that might be where you'll see more unique insights or- or gather more insights, and you could do that through, I don't know, I'm just thinking subreddits, meeting a lot of people who are like really excited some other thing. It could be like some weird robotics like niche, hobbyist community, for example. And a lot of that, I think, will- will hone or just like create serendipity for ideas. You might see patterns, or you might see, you know, if problem statements emerge from many people in that community that are facing similar things.\nAnd then there's like the other- other component too, which is really about like observing trends and- and changes, whether it's like a consumer behavior shift. Let's take an obvious one. Today is like distributed working. So, five- five years ago when the Weekend Fund started, that was one of our themes. It was like I- I- I think distributed working will be on the rise for a number of reasons. One, you know, i- it's harder and harder to recruit. Two, there's a subset of people who really valuable that flexibility and autonomy. And then fast forward, we had COVID, so like we had remote working, and- and now, that's a huge consumer behavior shift. Not just in how people work but also, like going to your Airbnb like world, like Airbnb has shifted their entire product to support more of this remote working kind of lifestyle, just the way that the- the homepage is now more of a catalog of places that you could explore at different times of the year versus Airbnb before was more like, \"I have a very specific vacation trip that I wanna take during these days in these areas.\"\nIt's like a very different like browsing kind of experience. So, that's just one example. Consumer behavior shifts is one thing to observe. The other is technology shifts. So, what- what new thing can you build today that couldn't be built yesterday? And so, there's- there's a bunch of categories around there, like Web3, AI, you know. The biggest shift that we've seen is- is mobile in like early 2010s, um, 'ish, that unlocked a whole- whole bunch of things. So, so, yeah, I think it's observing those shifts and those changes. Last thing I'll say on that is like I think startups, since there are more and more people building companies and technology, there's essentially more efficiency. It's certainly not a- an efficient, super efficient market, but there is more efficiency in problem discovery and- and- and solution exploration. And so, for that reason, you need even more reasons for things to- sort of answers to the, \"Why now?\"\nLike what's changed? What insight do you have? Why doesn't this exist already? 'Cause a bunch of people are trying to build something in the space most likely. Just a lot of what we think about, especially on the investing side, when we talk to founders.\n[00:55:14] Lenny: Wow. There's s- way too much good advice there. Have you written this down anywhere? Is there a Tweet thread people can find like your kind of approach to coming up with an idea?\n[00:55:22] Ryan: I have not, I don't think so. \n[00:55:24] Lenny: Cool. All right. Now we have to-\n[00:55:26] Ryan: Blog post for the future.\n[00:55:27] Lenny: Yeah. Or this is the, uh, this is the- the- the content for people to save and use. Thanks for sharing all that. That was really helpful. One other question I wanted to ask you along these lines is around the target audience and, uh, something ... A- an insight that we both share is that it's really important to get really narrow, whatever you focus on initially, as a start up, and it's, for founders, it's often so counterintuitive, they're like, you know, it's like, \"Oh my god, why should I focus on the 1000 people? Or 10000 type people-\n... Versus the millions that might wanna use this thing?\" What's your sense, and where have you kind of seen that become important? Just the idea of getting very narrow of how you're going after.\n[00:56:05] Ryan: Yeah, it's, effectively, the more narrow you're- you're generally, and this is where I throw in the big asterisks, like not for everything, there's always contextual differences, but generally, the easier it is to build a great solution for those people, because now you can actually hone in the product experience, the messaging, and everything to serve exactly those people. And it can help with the product side, it can help with the marketing and go-to market where you- you're messaging ... When people land on your homepage, you don't need to create kind of a broader kind of like value prop to everybody, but really, you can focus on like what is the- the problem this particular audience or community is- is facing. And so, generally, it's just easier.\nNow there is always that challenge of like, \"Well, is this too small? Is it too- too much of a niche if- if my goal is to build like a massive company?\" My bias is not to worry too much about that because what you probably find is, over time, opportunities to expand beyond that. You'll see parallels, maybe to other communities or to other problems. And a lot of companies, you know, eventually expand well beyond that. Like I'll go back to Airbnb, you know the story way better than I do, but you know, initially, it was just like, you know, basically couches and extra rooms in houses. And like a lot of people, most people in the US would not do that. Like my parents, not- not in a million years. Even me, like I don't wanna like stay in some stranger's like room. I want my own space, my own house. So, that- that probably at the time seemed really niche and like small, but obviously, they extended- extended well beyond that.\nNow- now I view Airbnb as like housing in generally speaking. Like their- their TM is housing in- in my mind, which they haven't yet exp- expanded into like real estate sales or like longterm rentals, per se, but like that- that's a possibility.\n[00:57:51] Lenny: This is a good segue to the last topic I wanted to touch on, investing, which I believe you do full-time. Would you say that it's- your full-time gig now?\n[00:57:59] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, I'm spending all my time there, and yeah.\n[00:58:02] Lenny: Cool. So, from what I can tell, the Weekend Fund is killin' it. I'm not an LP, but it feels like it's kind of this underrated juggernaut that's just doing very well. And so, I wanted to ask you a couple questions along these lines. One is what have you learned about investing, angel investing? Especially what's most surprised you?\n[00:58:20] Ryan: I mean I feel like there's a lot ... A lot we've learned. So, there's- there's things on the operational side. Like running a fund, there's a bunch of things that go into it, from LP communications, LP fundraising. There's also like ... Vedika who works with me on the fund side, she, um, she describes it as like hygiene. There's also good hygiene when it comes to running a fund. For example, you know, when you meet a founder, you- you- you should get back to them. [laughs] Like if it's a pass, you should let them know. And then there's a lot of different ways that you can do that. Some people, you know, might just say like \"pass,\" and that's not very encouraging to a founder if they gave you no context, no details. There's also an element of hygiene, which is you always follow up with the person that introduced us to that company. And we just feel it's kinda like that's what we appreciate.\n\nLike we like to kinda know what happened, like s- have them close the loop. And so, there's like good hygiene, operational things that we've learned and kinda honed over- over the years. I mean the biggest surprise, the biggest surprise has probably been ... I gotta be careful of how this is interpreted in some ways, but it's ... There are cases when I didn't think the company would make it. I- uh, either the product wasn't working, and you know, many months had passed, and it was very clear that they're- they- well, to me, I thought it was clear that, okay, that this probably isn't gonna work out. In my head I kinda wrote it off. And then that company either pivoted or- or some m- like massive partnership or MMA event came through out of nowhere, and so I- I guess the learning is like never count a portfolio company out until it's over.\nAnd, you know, uh, that relies on, of course, backing founders that are very resilient and creative and- and, you know, driven to- to create momentum, you know, out of nothing, but- but that's been surprising to me. And it makes me kind of excited because, you know, we invested in over 110 companies now and it's- it's fun to be able to kinda see behind-the-scenes a little bit how all these things kind of play out, both the good and the bad.\n[01:00:13] Lenny: That's such an inspiring takeaway. Does that change how you invest? Like to me, that's like, \"All right, I guess I should just take more bets on founders that are awesome.\" Although, I find just founder bets, it's like a very expensive hobby/approach because there's so there's so many great founders. How is that informed how you invest seeing that happen?\n[01:00:33] Ryan: I would say we don't, we don't have like, um, it's again, my cop out it's contextual kind of answer. Like, you know, some people are like, \"We are a team first only.\" Some are, \"We're market first.\" Some are, \"We're product first.\" And we- we look at everything kind of holistically, and I think the evaluation of the product is- is sort of a reflection on the team. So, our- our assessment of the thinking behind the product that they built today and maybe some of the traction is a reflection on like the team's abilities and like the thought processes.\nSo, we try to look at it holistically in, um, I mean, yeah, I mean every investor would say like, \"Yeah, we wanna back, you know, resilient founders that are very driven, insightful, and all those things,\" of course. But it's also sometimes hard to like fully evaluate that, unless you really know that person. So, so, we try to- to- to take as much data around like how the product is working and how they made those decisions leading up to this to- to evaluate the team sort of indirectly.\n[01:01:26] Lenny: That's kinda what I've started to do is I- I try not to invest as a founder bet unless I just know them because it's just so hard otherwise.\n[01:01:35] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there- there's a few founder bets that- that we've made. One, going back to the consumer social kind of thing, he's somebody I've known for many, many years. One of the most talented like designers, engineers, product builders. And I've just been waiting for him to start a company and- and so, that was- that was one of those, \"I'm gonna bet on you because I believe in you. I'm not sure about this first idea, uh, you know, who am I to judge? But I don't know if that's gonna be it,\" but [laughs] he's probably gonna launch 10 apps, and the 11th is gonna be a massive success. And so, that's sort of the- the way I think about those consumer social founder first bets.\n[01:02:10] Lenny: I love that. Last question along these lines, for someone that's hoping to get into investing or angel investing in the near future, do you have any advice for folks around that?\n[01:02:20] Ryan: Yeah, actually, I wrote a tweet storm and like converted it to a blog post on this 'cause we've get- gotten a lot of ... You probably as well, get a lot of emails or people saying, \"Hey, I'm thinking about raising a fund. Like how should I do that?\" or \"I wanna get into- to venture. I wanna start investing. Like what advice do you have?\" So, yeah, I wrote a blog post on this, and there's many different ways to invest. There's, you know, angel investing is one. So, great thing about that is if you have the capital to angel invest, you can do it today, tomorrow. Like you- there- there's no- no sign-offs required. You have maximum flexibility, but of course, you need to have disposable income. You need to be able to- [laughs] be willing to lose all of it and then hopefully you, you know, you'll ma- you'll be on the other side of that and make some money in 10 years. \n It takes a long time. There's scouting; that's another option. And there are more and more scout funds probably than ever before right now, in different flavors. Some of them are like dedicated kind of scout programs where you have capital to deploy on your own, some are more like you still need approval, but you send the deals, and you get carry on those deals in many cases. Those have pros and cons too. Like they're easier to start and get into than raising a fund typically for most people, but you also are sort of reliant on that- that program or that fund. Um, you might have less autonomy in what you can invest in and what you can't. And then there's a few others; there's SPVs is- is one angle, which works really well for a lot of people. So, um, for those that maybe don't know and- and listening to this right now, SPVs are essentially like a single vehicle, um, investment into one company.\nSo, you raise money from LPs, from other investors, to invest in this specific company. And there are a few great things about that. Like one, you get deal-by-deal carry, meaning like the- the outcome of that company is- is you get paid when they exit essentially, assuming there's a positive outcome versus a fund, like you have to return the entire fund first. Two, it allows you to also bring in maybe very strategic, helpful people into that particular round for that company, which can actually be a- a strong value add for that founder. The biggest trade-off is it's a lot of work sometimes. You- you have to basically do a fundraiser [laughs] every couple you invest in, and that's super time-consuming for a lot of people. And then the last thing is like r- rai- raising a fund.\nSo, that's the decision that I decided back in 2017 is I wanted to raise a fund. It's a lot more work to raise the capital and- and- and there's a lot more responsibility in managing funds and so on and so forth, but it provided me with the most flexibility and- and a way to deploy many checks into many companies, especially when I didn't and still don't have like a ton of money to angel invest. So, yeah, those are like different options. Like I think my blog post goes into more like pros and cons for each of those things, but the last thing I'll say actually is, let's say, none of those are really an option. You- you- you don't wanna start a fund. You don't have enough relationships to do SPVs. You- for whatever reason, you can't do a scout. You don't have any money to angel invest. One thing you can also do is just like pretend angel invest. [laughs] And that doesn't mean that you're meeting the founder and like writing a check, but you can write memos, or you can like almost create a fantasy portfolio.\nAnd this is what Vedika, before she joined- joined me, was doing to some extent. She was writing memos about companies she was excited about. And in some ways, she was like doing the job before getting the job, and anyone can do that today. And that can be helpful too if you're applying or trying to prove your- your- your abilities. You could say, \"Hey, here are the memos. Here are the companies that I would have invested in, you know, if I had the opportunity, and, you know, here's my thought process behind that.\"\n[01:05:49] Lenny: I love that. I'm curious about the logistics of knowing the prices of all these startups, but anyway, we don't have to get into all of [laughs] that. That's an awesome idea. I've seen people on Twitter do that too. What's- where do you think this all goes for you? Are you thinking of increasing the fund? That's basically the last question. Just, yeah, what's- what’s- the future of Ryan- Ryan Hoover at this point, as far as [laughs] you know?\n\n[01:06:08] Ryan: Yeah, still- still figuring out the meaning of life, as we established earlier.\n[01:06:12] Lenny: I thought we cracked that one. \n[01:06:13] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. I'll let you know when I figure it out.\n[01:06:15] Lenny: Okay.\n[01:06:16] Ryan: Um, uh, [laughs], um, yeah, we're on our third fund right now. We're actually about 30, 35% deployed, so we have plenty of- of capital, and we're not gonna be raising any time soon. Yeah, we're just investing in early stage companies right now, but yeah, when I fast forward like longer term, I don't know. I will always be investing. I'm also more of a fan of maintaining a smaller fund. Our latest fund is 21 million, and that might ... I might change my mind on this, but that might be the biggest fund we ever raise. I might keep it around that same size for the next one because it really allows us to be f- really collaborative. We can write smaller checks. We can fit into competitive deals. I think it's a better product for founders. Like we're not tryin' to take the entire round. We can, you know, try to bring on the Lennys of the world as co-investors, things like that. \nAnd so, investing will always be a part of my future, but I also love building. Building is- is the most fun, so creating something is- whether it's a company ... I don't know- I don't know what it is. I'm not even gonna call it a company, but building something is hopefully in my future. I just gotta figure out the right idea. And maybe, maybe reflect on your blog post too on the idea generation stuff that you shared 'cause that- that is helpful.\n[01:07:22] Lenny: As long as you let me invest all is good. \n[01:07:27] Ryan: [laughs] I don't know- I don't know if I'll- part of me is like, \"Do I ever wanna raise from venture?\" Now it depends on the idea. If- if I need it, if it's required strategically, then yes, but to be quite honest, maybe I shouldn't say this, like I'm kind of really interested in just owning something 100% and you can always raise venture later. Like it- it's a one-way door, so I kinda wanna delay that door, you know, for whatever I build next, if I can.\n[01:07:53] Lenny: I 100% get that. That's how life is with this newsletter operation and I highly recommend it.\n[01:07:59] Ryan: Yeah. \n[01:07:59] Lenny: If you can pull it off. Okay. Um, that's it. Just a couple- just where can people find you online? It's kind of a dumb question 'cause you're very easy to find, but where do people go to learn more if they wanna reach out? And then- and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n[01:08:14] Ryan: Yeah, I'm just, uh, easy to find. R- Rhoover on Twitter, Ryanhoover.me, simple website. I have a bunch of old blog posts on there, probably with a bunch of broken links and broken images, but it's there. The content's there. I don't know. We're- we're investing- we're investing in the early stage companies, B2B, B2C. If you're building something weird, I don't know, DM me, email me, I'm around.\n[01:08:35] Lenny: Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. It's kind of a surreal experience interviewing you. And I'm really honored that you came, and I can't wait for people to hear this. I'm really happy about all the nuggets that [laughs] I was able to extract out of your head, and thank you for sharing them. Thanks for being here.\n[01:08:52] Ryan: Yeah, thanks, Lenny. Yeah, these- these conversations are- are helpful and like reflecting on what do I actually believe anyway. So, it's- it's just like writing, it's helpful.\n[01:09:00] Lenny: Yeah, and it is just as helpful to everybody else. So thank you again.\n[01:09:04] Ryan: Cool. Thanks Lenny.\n[01:09:06] Lenny: Thank you so much for listening.

Hunt是2013年底开始的，很快在科技——科技圈获得了很大的关注。所以，是的，科技圈的人可能会认出我。科技圈以外的人，我怀疑——怀疑他们会认出我。嗯，我确实在想，我留长发是不是潜意识里为了避免被认出来。\n\n嗯，我不确定是不是真的，但不管怎样，我留长发已经几年了，我就想，啊，我有时候只是想隐身。但是，你知道，在旧金山，那里每个人都在科技圈，嗯，经常会发生这种事。可能那个——那个让我意识到\"哦，这——这是个事儿\"的时刻，呃，可能是Product Hunt早期，呃，我在——你记得吗...我不知道你知不知道。你知道一个叫DNA Lounge的俱乐部吗，他们有个活动——\n\n[00:04:19] Lenny: 嗯嗯。\n\n[00:04:20] Ryan: ……叫Bootie，每周六——\n\n[00:04:20] Lenny: 嗯嗯。\n\n[00:04:21] Ryan: ……就像混音舞会。\n\n[00:04:22] Lenny: 对。\n\n[00:04:23] Ryan: 对。在湾区非常有名。非常有趣，有趣的，呃，体验。总之，我记得当时和朋友们在一起喝酒，就像——就像人们会做的那样，然后有人转过身说，\"那是Product Hunt的那个人吗?\"\n\n[00:04:33] Lenny: [笑]\n\n[00:04:33] Ryan: 那是第一次在那种场合发生这种事，我当时想，哦天哪，现在我得考虑我的行为了。我不能只是像，完全放松，你知道，和朋友们放松一下。嗯，所以不管怎样，这种事总是有利有弊的。嗯，但你知道，这——这确实让我更加意识到，我本来就是一个非常，有时焦虑和像自我意识很强的人，对周围环境很敏感。\n\n所以当你把这个和\"哦，这些陌生人可能在看我\"结合起来，这不是世界上最好的事情，但也还好。\n\n[00:05:04] Lenny: 我最近实际上也经历了一点类似的体验，在我的，以一种小得多的方式，我——随着这个newsletter的发展和这个东西的增长，世界各地都在举办见面会。所以我偶尔会去参加旧金山的见面会，感觉很奇怪，被人认识，人们——他们会和我合照，就像什么——到底发生了什么。\n\n因为我是在COVID来袭时开始做这个的，就像——每个人都在家，我只是在电脑上打字，不用去任何地方。随着世界重新开放，这成了我正在应对的新——新事物，规模要小得多。\n\n[00:05:35] Ryan: 对对。活动很有趣。嗯，我们在Product Hunt举办了很多活动。呃，是的，你——你会拍很多自拍，很多像握手之类的，有——有一些能量在那里。不过我是个内向的人。所以到了第三四个小时，我就像，呃…啊…我需要去洗手间，因为我没法脱身，社交上已经筋疲力尽了，所以，但活动确实很有趣。\n\n[00:05:55] Lenny: 我知道，呃，我完全理解你的意思。我也是个内向的人，做那种事会让我非常疲惫。我本来要问你这个问题。所以是的。嗯，沿着同样的思路，你——你是个非常公开的人。你经常发推，分享很多东西，做很多播客之类的。有什么是人们不知道的关于你的事吗?\n\n[00:06:12] Ryan: 对。嗯，你说得对。我——我可能——可能分享过度了，呃，在Twitter和其他地方…\n\n[00:06:17] Lenny: 不，那，那不是我的意思——\n\n[00:06:18] Ryan: 嗯，还有一大堆[笑]不，不，我知道。我知道你在说什么。嗯，但也有一整系列我不谈论的事情。嗯，其中一些——好吧，不管怎样，我不会谈论那些我不能谈论的事情。\n\n呃，但有一件事，嗯，大多数人不知道的一件事——我知道有——有一些劲爆的事情，呃，就像每个人生活中都有的那样。嗯，我最近搬到了——好吧，我想已经一年了。嗯，大约一年前我搬到了迈阿密，呃，我一直没有公开谈论这件事，主要是因为我不想被归类为，哦，又一个搬到迈阿密的人。\n\n就像，我，我不知道。我只是，我这样做没有任何好处或理由。呃，我希望我在迈阿密的朋友知道我在那里，但除此之外我不需要全世界都知道。我想现在他们会知道了。嗯，话虽如此，在迈阿密，你知道，我们——我们一年大约三分之二的时间在那里，所以我现在其实在加州。\n\n嗯，你知道的，夏季湿热来袭，还有飓风季节。我们——我们计划更多地做，嗯——我不会称之为游牧生活，我也不会称之为完全的两地生活，但类似那样的。一年三分之二的时间我们在迈阿密，然后可能三分之一在纽约，或洛杉矶，或其他地方。\n\n嗯，我很喜欢这样。嗯，幸运的是，我们有这种灵活性，呃，当我说我们时，我是指我的女朋友Susie和我，可以带着笔记本电脑在任何地方工作。所以这是——这是一种不错的生活方式转变。\n\n[00:07:33] Lenny: 我不知道这个，这很有意思。是什么把你吸引到迈阿密的?是什么吸引你去那里?\n\n[00:07:39] Ryan: 对。你知道吗?嗯，所以我描述城市的方式有点像一个产品。所以如果你在超市——超市，我听起来像个老——老人了。哈，如果——如果你在商店，你在看不同的产品，或者如果你在网上，你在评估不同的产品，它们各自都有成本和一些好处，嗯，或价值或任何你——你想用来描述的东西。\n\n对我来说，每个城市都有点像那样。所以，你知道，在成本方面，有住房、呃、食物、税收等生活成本，有很多东西构成了在这个城市生活的成本。然后这个城市提供很多好处和——诸如此类的东西。所以在洛杉矶——所以我在湾区待了十年，洛杉矶两年，迈阿密一年。\n\n现在，它们各有各的优缺点。它们实际上的成本都不同。\n\n然而，我认为创始人能够看到自己在这件事上长期投入是超级重要的……我的经验法则是十年，你能看到自己在这上面工作十年吗？\n\n也许你实际上不会做满十年。很可能不会，它要么会像大多数创业公司那样在那之前就失败了，但我认为这是一个很好的自我检验——\"我真的足够在乎这件事吗？我真的很兴奋能在这上面工作很多很多年吗？\"但另一方面，我认为很多人也会想\"我需要创办一家公司。我需要做一个 startup。\"\n\n然后他们就直接跳到那一步，而没有先去修修补补、构建一些东西。你知道，Product Hunt，我们甚至不称它为副业项目，我们称它为一个实验。我认为这种定位对我来说一直很有帮助，因为实验真的不是关于成功。当然你希望它成功，但目标不是成功。\n\n我给\"成功\"打个引号，实验真正的目的是学习，看看人们是否想要这个东西，然后进行调整。所以实验性思维是有帮助的，我认为这是一种有价值的开始方式。这甚至可以追溯到我为什么把基金命名为 Weekend Fund。就像，你周末在折腾什么？\n\n你知道吗？你怎样才能更好奇、更具实验性地探索新的创业想法？\n\n[00:17:43] Lenny: 我不知道这就是它叫 Weekend Fund 的原因。我以为是因为你在周末做这个，还是两者都有？\n\n[00:17:48] Ryan: [笑] 它有多重含义。是的，有三个含义：第一个是我在做 Product Hunt 的时候创办了 Weekend Fund。所以很多与创始人的路演和电话都是在周末进行的。第二，我认为很多伟大的想法都是从比喻意义上的\"夜晚和周末\"开始的，就像副业项目或构思阶段。\n\n然后第三个原因是它更友好一些。我不知道，我不想把它命名为 Hoover Capital 或者什么那种冷冰冰的名字，我想要它——\n\n[00:18:14] Lenny: 等等，那可是个很棒的名字。Hoover Capital。哇。\n\n[00:18:18] Ryan: ……Capital。呃，我不知道。我觉得……\n\n[00:18:23] Lenny: 是的，这不符合你的品牌风格，\n\n[00:18:24] Ryan: 是的。\n\n[00:18:25] Lenny: 但它很有力量——\n\n[00:18:25] Ryan: 嗯，是的。[笑]\n\n[00:18:28] Lenny: 你知道的，我在 Twitter 上问大家想问你什么问题。所以我会在我们的对话中穿插这些问题。你刚才提到了 Product Hunt 和融资，我很好奇如果让你回到过去重新来一次。\n\n你还会为 Product Hunt 融资吗，还是不会？\n\n[00:18:44] Ryan: 好问题。当时，这也是我[笑]会问创始人的问题——你为什么需要融资？它是用来做什么的？令人惊讶的是，有些人——我不知道——他们没有一个清晰的答案。对我来说，这是很明显的。我们需要——我们需要招人，我们需要人手。我没有个人资金来支付员工工资。\n\n有一个替代方案，就是我们实际上以开源方式构建。我当时在想\"这可能吗？\"我们是在为科技社区构建产品。我相信很多人会很乐意参与。我们能以开源的方式构建吗？但那真的很难做到。\n\n当你在创建一家公司时，你可能不想在太多事情上创新，包括如何构建产品和组建团队。总之，回答你的问题，如果我——我不知道当时融资是不是正确的决定，因为我想要招人，而我没有个人资金。\n\n当时真的没有其他现实的选择。我不认为有。今天我可以用自己的钱走得更远——我不是超级富有，而且流动性很差，但我至少有足够的钱可以资助一个非常小的团队一年左右的开发。所以今天可能会有点不同，我可能不会融 VC 的钱，因为 Product Hunt 不是那种需要融很多钱的公司类型。\n\n它也不是那种有直接竞争对手的情况，比如 Uber 和 Lyft 那样，融资实际上有点强制性，你必须建立一个庞大的战争基金来竞争。所以如果我有更多钱，也许我就不会融 VC 的钱了。但是……还有很多其他的决定和事情，可能是更大的错误。并不是说融资是个错误。当时我认为这是正确的决定，但……事后诸葛亮总是很清晰的。\n\n[00:20:31] Lenny: 你提到的那一点，就像你只是需要钱来运营这个东西。我认为当人们抨击那些可能不需要融资的创业公司融资的想法时，这一点被严重忽视了。你就是需要钱。你没有钱可以烧，也不想负债。融一些钱，看看这东西能走到哪里，即使你不知道它会走向何方，这是说得通的。\n\n[00:20:49] Ryan: 嗯嗯。是的，特别是如果……我的意思是，我认为从与你价值观一致的人那里融资是非常重要的。也就是说，\"这个人为什么想投资你的基金？\"呃，抱歉，不是基金……你的公司。当你走上某条道路，当你融 A 轮、B 轮、C 轮时，你有不同的期望，和你融 pre-seed 或 seed 轮时不同。所以我认为理解你在签什么约也是超级重要的。\n\n[00:21:16] Lenny: 你在上什么样的跑步机。\n\n[00:21:18] Ryan: 是的。因为你不能下来。我是说你可以，但这不像在一家公司工作……我总是说当你在一家公司时，你可以提前两周通知、一个月通知。你可以继续前进。作为创始人或 CEO，你不能。你真的不能。现在你技术上可以……但你不能，真的很难退出。\n\n[00:21:38] Lenny: 是的。我看 Airbnb 的创始人们已经做了 15 年了。你知道，他们生活过得很好，但他们也……很难离开。\n\n[00:21:46] Ryan: 嗯嗯。\n\n[00:21:38] Lenny: 是的。回到 Product Hunt，人们在 Product Hunt 上发布他们的产品，这是个事儿。我很好奇；创始人总是非常痴迷于发布和发布的力量，\"我们得发布。\"你认为发布对公司来说值得吗？这是创始人应该花时间做的事情，还是通常最好不要在这上面花时间，只是慢慢构建？\n\n[00:22:07] Ryan: 是的，我总是……每当我分享我的观点时，我总是强调它有点取决于具体情况，这听起来像是一个推脱的答案。所以，更准确地说……我的答案通常更细致入微，关于发布这件事——回到你为什么融资的问题。目标是什么？同样的道理。你为什么要发布？很多人默认的想法是客户获取，\"哦，我想获取客户。\"但有时候这实际上并没有用。发布有时候对此并没有帮助，但你可能想要发布还有很多其他原因。\n\n所以，客户获取是一个，传播消息。另一个可以是招聘。通过分享你的故事，让人们兴奋起来，这可能会让招聘变得更容易，让人们对你正在构建的东西感到兴奋。另一个是融资。有时它可以创造势头，你知道，其他投资者，他们确实会看新闻，他们知道当这家公司更公开时，某个特定交易可能会更热门。反馈是一个。来自用户的反馈，偶然得到的反馈。还有一个是合作伙伴关系。所以，当你发布时，你也可能会遇到更多的合作伙伴关系，更多的机会。我认为发布有一种偶然性效应。所以，我认为理解业务的优先级是什么。比如如果你——可能根本不是客户获取，可能是\"我们需要招聘和雇人。让我们发布，这样我们就能传播消息。希望这能帮助我们找到下一个工程师、设计师或其他人。\"\n\n然后我还看到发布也有一些小的附带好处，我们通过 Product Hunt 看到了很多。其中之一是团队士气。这个——我认为这被忽视了。我也会鼓励[笑]创始人不要让他们的团队过于……我会说——你不应该仅仅为了在 Twitter 上获得点赞和在 Product Hunt 上获得投票而发布产品，但这确实有一种强大的团队士气和凝聚力建设时刻，你们可以一起庆祝你们所完成的、所构建的，并把它展示给世界。你知道，团队中的某个人可以与他们的妈妈分享 Product Hunt 的发布或某篇 Tech Crunch 的文章。你知道，这看起来像是一件微不足道、毫无意义的事情，但它对很多人来说确实很重要。然后另一个是 SEO。所以，如果 SEO 是你策略的一部分，有文章、正面的文章，有一个成功的 Product Hunt 发布，这类事情也会有帮助。\n\n[00:24:21] Lenny: 太棒了。我喜欢最后那个关于士气的观点。我之前没想到这个。你可能比其他任何人见过更多的发布。你估计你见过或者[笑]观察过多少次创业公司的发布？如果这个问题有意义的话。\n\n[00:24:38] Ryan: 嗯，我应该看看我们 Product Hunt 的数据库，看看我们有多少次发布，因为这会是其中的一部分。\n\n我的意思是，看过的，我——我——有些是非常高层面的，但这些年加起来有数万个。\n\n[00:24:48] Lenny: 好的，那么当你想到这些时，你能感觉到什么因素会导致一次出色的发布，而不仅仅是普通的发布吗？创始人在发布时会错过什么？\n\n[00:25:01] Ryan: 是的，我是说这——这要追溯到大学以及——还有那个——你知道，我不会开始抱怨教育，但在，呃，你知道，英语课和写作课上，很多老师教人们用大词写作，填满整页内容，基本上不像人说话。所以，我注意到创始人和普通人的一个问题是，他们倾向于像公关人员那样写作，而不是像人类那样，不像，你知道，我描述写作框架的方式，比如你在 Product Hunt 上的标语，嗯，或者你的整体发布，就像——你的客户或用户如何向其他人描述你的产品？或者另一个框架是你如何向朋友描述它？比如当你只是，你知道，闲逛时，你如何描述你做什么，你构建了什么，它是做什么的？我认为这种语言能引起人们的共鸣，因为它感觉更真实。\n\n那些使用流行词汇和——以及模糊语言的人，就是不能产生共鸣。人们一眼就能看穿——人们厌倦了公关（笑）式的说辞。所以，我认为语言和微文案、文案写作非常重要。然后还有很多其他方面，比如我们应该更多地关注产品，而不是发布本身。比如你真的了解你在为谁构建吗？你理解如何传达价值主张吗——在用户心中它是什么？有很多，我想，更具战略性的决策要在发布之前做出。\n\n[00:26:22] Lenny: 想象一下，这些，呃，观点每一个都可以成为自己的播客和博客文章。（笑）人们在 Twitter 上问我的一个经典问题是，\"我如何在 Product Hunt 上排名第一？\"所以，我的问题是，我知道这就像……不会有银弹。有没有一份指南，你可以指给人们看，就像\"这里，照着这个建议做就行\"，或者，我不知道，两三个你必须做对的关键点。\n\n[00:26:44] Ryan: 是的。是的，所以在下面的帖子里，实际上有链接——链接到一堆指南和常见问题解答之类的。所以，找到那些最佳实践真的很容易。团队还有一份清单。所以，一旦你发布，就会有一份清单，列出建议或提示。我现在实际上忘记了每一项具体是什么，但我注意到一些产生重大影响的事情是，我们已经讨论过标语文案，这不仅适用于帖子，也适用于创作者。通常人们倾向于添加一些介绍，一些背景。呃，一般来说很多人会，他们——他们在那里制造公关式的说辞，所以像人类一样说话，我认为很重要。同时保持简短。有些人写论文，这可能很有趣，但现实是大多数消费者，特别是 Product Hunt 上的人，你知道，他们——他们在浏览一堆想法。他们在寻找激发他们好奇心和兴趣的东西。\n\n他们可能对阅读（笑）论文不是特别感兴趣，你知道，来自——来自创作者的。所以，保持简短，我认为是有帮助的。然后另一个重要的是画廊——往往是某人登陆页面后第一眼看到的东西。所以，很自然地，我们的眼睛会被视觉内容吸引。我见过一些最有趣的呈现方式是，人们把画廊当作幻灯片来使用，嗯，就像讲故事一样，每张幻灯片都在传达——传达某种不同的——嗯，某种故事。可能像是，\"这是使用我们产品的前后对比\"，或者\"这是产品功能的演变\"。有很多不同的方法，但像一个真正干净的，你知道，视觉上有趣的故事，嗯，也可以是吸引人们对你所构建内容感兴趣的好方法。\n\n[00:28:21] Lenny: 太棒了。这非常实用和有帮助。如果你自己在 Product Hunt 上发布东西，而不是被 Ryan Hoover 推荐，你认为你会登顶吗？\n\n[00:28:30] Ryan: (笑) 我——我是说我不知道。这——这很有趣，因为如果你……我们应该对 Product Hunt 做一些历史分析，因为我很好奇实际的数字，但它的变化很大。所以，有些人问我，\"嘿，比如我不知道，Product Hunt 是不是……B2B 公司在那里表现好吗？\"我说，\"是的，比如很——可能实际上 B2B 公司比 B2C 公司还多\"，所以你看到，你知道，看似无聊的公司触及到了某些——某些人们觉得有用或引起共鸣的东西，嗯，可以登顶。然后你也看到奇怪的、古怪的东西，你知道，那些——那些搞笑的应用也能登顶。所以，我不知道，它真的变化很大。\n\n有时也是由类似时代精神驱动的，比如人们现在觉得什么有趣？比如什么激发了人们的兴趣？因为 Product Hunt，一方面，你可能在吸引那些可能成为未来用户和客户、合作伙伴等的人，但它也只是早期采用者技术社区的一种时代精神。他们对什么感兴趣？他们总体上觉得什么有吸引力？\n\n[00:29:34] Lenny: 明白了。好的，所以我有一堆来自 Twitter 的问题，人们（笑）想问你。所以，让我问你其中几个，它们有点分散，但我们看看——看看会怎样。Jessica Toye，她是——她是 Angel List 的 PM，她实际上是朋友。我们以前一起在 Airbnb。她问了一个很好的问题。\n\n[00:29:53] Ryan: 是的。Jess——Jess 很棒。她——向 Jess 致敬，她在 Angel List 那边非常有帮助，所以她很棒。\n\n[00:29:59] Lenny: 太棒了。好的，她是最棒的。她问你作为 PM 学到的什么对你的风险投资职业有帮助。\n\n[00:30:06] Ryan: 是的，嗯，是的，所以我的——我的背景是，呃，营销然后产品管理。很快，呃，曾经在游戏行业工作，那就像，我认为，一个——一个很棒的行业。在那个行业很难成功，但像是一个学习的好地方，而且，不，不，呃，我有很多偏见，所以我必须小心，但我——我——有产品背景，我认为，是早期创业投资最重要的方面之一，意思是通常，当你在建立一家新公司时，有很多风险，有很多重要的事情要——要搞定，但最终一切都归结为你正在构建的产品。所以，我认为有产品管理或产品背景是有帮助的。首先，在评估不同想法时有更多，我想，视角，而且——而且可以说更重要的是，呃，创始人如何思考事情。所以，这可能不太关于我评估这个特定想法的——市场需求，而是思考过程是什么，以及这个创始人是如何得出这些产品想法和这些洞察的。所以，我认为有产品管理背景对此有帮助，而且我不知道，我也觉得与创始人讨论产品真的很有趣。当还在早期阶段时，有——有更多机会创造某种影响，或者，你知道，以某种轻微的方式帮助塑造产品。\n\n[00:31:20] Lenny: 太棒了。基本上如果你是 PM，你已经拥有了成为创始人所需的很多技能。\n\n[00:31:24] Ryan: 创始人以及——而且可以说，投资人，嗯，也是。\n\n[00:31:27] Lenny: 哦，没错。好的。所以，呃，Sousa Ventures 的 Leo，他也是个很棒的家伙，呃，他问如果你能回到过去并且——\n\n[00:31:35] Ryan: 我在，呃，迈阿密见到了 Leo，呃，不久前。\n\n[00:31:39] Lenny: 哦是的。他也搬到迈阿密了。哦我的天。每个人都在那边。好的，所以（笑），呃，他问如果你能回到过去重新构建 Product Hunt，你会做什么不同的事？我们谈了一点这个，但还有其他的吗？\n\n[00:31:50] Ryan: 是的。嗯，我最近实际上一直在想这个问题。而且，嗯，是的，我是说有几件事。呃，第一，Product Hunt 在最开始，以及今天仍然，非常专注于科技，而且有一度，有雄心扩展到科技之外的所有不同类型的，你知道，产品类别。所以，你知道，我们在播客方面做过实验，实际上是播客发现。\n\n我们在视频游戏发现方面做过实验，我们在图书发现方面做过实验，那里的论点是，\"好的，这实际上可以成为所有这些社区发现所有这些不同产品的发现平台\"，我认为那里有很多好想法。然而，我严重低估了做两件事的难度:第一，Product Hunt 上的产品体验与你想要发现视频游戏或者未来可能的时尚和其他各种类型产品的方式非常不同。\n\n第二，真的很难转化一个社区并扩展到其他社区。比如有些——有些做到了。比如 Reddit 也许是一个很好的例子，Reddit 有这个庞大的（笑）长尾，你知道，各种你能想象到的社区，但很少有公司和平台能真正做到这一点。所以，那是一个——一个遗憾，我们不应该尝试横向扩展。我们应该只是完全专注于纵向，并且——并且更好地服务科技社区，你知道，用更多东西，这实际上就是我们现在正在做的。另一个遗憾，另一件我会改变的事是，我会——我会实际上尝试更早地货币化和产生收入。\n\n我不是 LP，但感觉它就像是一个被低估的巨头，表现非常出色。所以，我想问你几个相关的问题。一个是你在投资、天使投资方面学到了什么？特别是什么最让你惊讶？\n\n[00:58:20] Ryan: 我的意思是，我觉得我们学到了很多……真的很多。所以，有些是运营层面的事情。比如管理一支基金，有很多事情要做，从 LP 沟通到 LP 募资。还有就是…… Vedika 和我一起负责基金这边的工作，她把这称为\"卫生习惯\"。管理基金也需要良好的卫生习惯。比如说，你知道的，当你见到一个创始人，你应该给他们回复。[笑] 如果是拒绝，你应该让他们知道。而且有很多不同的方式可以做到这一点。有些人可能只是说\"拒绝\"，这对创始人来说不太友好，如果你不给任何背景信息或细节的话。还有一个卫生习惯的要素，就是你总是要跟介绍这家公司给我们的人反馈。我们觉得这就是我们所看重的。\n\n就像我们喜欢知道发生了什么，让他们完成这个闭环。所以，有良好的卫生习惯、运营方面的事情是我们多年来学到并不断磨练的。我的意思是，最大的惊喜，最大的惊喜可能是……我得小心这话怎么被理解，但是……有些情况下，我认为这家公司不会成功。要么是产品不行，你知道的，过了好几个月，很明显他们——嗯，对我来说，我觉得很明显，好吧，这可能不会成功。在我脑海中我基本上把它注销了。然后那家公司要么转型了，要么某个重大的合作伙伴关系或者某个重大事件突然出现，所以我——我想学到的是，永远不要放弃一家投资组合公司，直到真正结束。\n\n而且，你知道，这当然依赖于支持那些非常有韧性、有创造力、并且有动力从无到有创造势能的创始人，但这确实让我感到惊讶。这也让我感到兴奋，因为，你知道，我们现在已经投资了 110 多家公司，能够在幕后看到所有这些事情如何发展，无论是好的还是坏的，这很有意思。\n\n[01:00:13] Lenny: 这是一个非常鼓舞人心的收获。这会改变你的投资方式吗？对我来说，这就像是\"好吧，我想我应该在优秀的创始人身上下更多注\"。不过，我发现单纯押注创始人，这就像是一个非常昂贵的爱好/方法，因为有太多优秀的创始人了。看到这种情况发生，这如何影响你的投资方式？\n\n[01:00:33] Ryan: 我想说我们没有，我们没有那种，这又是我的敷衍答案，是那种情境化的回答。就像，你知道的，有些人说\"我们只看团队优先\"。有些人说\"我们市场优先\"。有些人说\"我们产品优先\"。而我们是全面地看待一切，我认为对产品的评估某种程度上反映了团队。所以，我们对他们今天构建的产品背后的思考以及可能的一些牵引力的评估，反映了团队的能力和思维过程。\n\n所以，我们试图全面地看待它，我的意思是，是的，我的意思是每个投资人都会说\"是的,我们想支持那些有韧性、非常有动力、有洞察力的创始人，以及所有这些特质\"，当然。但有时也很难完全评估这一点，除非你真正了解那个人。所以，我们试图收集尽可能多的数据，比如产品的运作情况以及他们是如何做出这些决策的，从而间接地评估团队。\n\n[01:01:26] Lenny: 这有点像我开始做的事情，我尽量不把赌注押在创始人身上，除非我真的了解他们，因为否则真的太难了。\n\n[01:01:35] Ryan: 是的，是的，我们确实下了一些创始人赌注。一个，回到消费者社交这件事，他是我认识很多很多年的人。最有才华的设计师、工程师、产品构建者之一。我一直在等他创办一家公司，所以，那是其中一个\"我要押注在你身上，因为我相信你。我不确定这第一个想法如何，你知道的,我有什么资格评判？但我不知道那是不是就是它\"，但 [笑] 他可能会推出 10 个应用，然后第 11 个会取得巨大成功。所以，这就是我对那些消费者社交领域创始人优先赌注的思考方式。\n\n[01:02:10] Lenny: 我喜欢。沿着这些思路的最后一个问题，对于希望在不久的将来进入投资或天使投资的人，你对这方面的人有什么建议吗？\n\n[01:02:20] Ryan: 是的，实际上，我写了一系列推文并转换成了一篇博客文章，因为我们收到了很多……你可能也是，收到很多邮件或者人们说\"嘿，我在考虑募集一支基金。我应该怎么做？\"或者\"我想进入风险投资。我想开始投资。你有什么建议？\"所以，是的，我写了一篇关于这个的博客文章，投资有很多不同的方式。你知道，天使投资是其中之一。所以，关于它的好处是，如果你有资金进行天使投资，你今天、明天就可以做。就像你不需要任何批准。你有最大的灵活性，但当然，你需要有可支配收入。你需要能够 [笑] 愿意失去所有这些，然后希望你，你知道的，你会在另一边，并在 10 年后赚一些钱。\n\n这需要很长时间。还有 scouting；这是另一个选择。现在可能有比以往任何时候都多的 scout 基金，有不同的形式。其中一些是专门的 scout 项目，你有资金可以自己部署，有些更像是你仍然需要批准，但你发送交易，在很多情况下你会从这些交易中获得 carry。这些也有利有弊。就像对大多数人来说，它们通常比募集基金更容易开始和进入，但你也在某种程度上依赖于那个项目或那个基金。你在投资什么和不能投资什么方面可能有较少的自主权。然后还有其他几种；SPV 是一个角度，对很多人来说效果很好。所以，对于那些可能不知道并且正在听这个的人，SPV 本质上就像一个单一工具，投资于一家公司。\n\n所以，你从 LP、从其他投资者那里筹集资金，投资于这个特定的公司。这有几个很棒的地方。比如一，你获得逐笔交易的 carry，意味着那家公司的结果是——当他们退出时你基本上会得到报酬，假设有积极的结果，而不是基金，你必须先返还整个基金。第二，它还允许你为那家特定公司的那轮融资引入可能非常战略性、有帮助的人，这实际上可以为那个创始人增加很强的价值。最大的权衡是有时工作量很大。你基本上每投资几家就要做一次募资 [笑]，这对很多人来说非常耗时。然后最后一件事是募集基金。\n\n所以，这是我在 2017 年做出的决定，我想募集一支基金。募集资金需要更多的工作，而且管理基金等等也有更多的责任，但它为我提供了最大的灵活性和向许多公司投入许多支票的方式，特别是当我没有也仍然没有大量资金进行天使投资时。所以，是的，这些是不同的选择。我想我的博客文章更深入地讨论了每个选项的利弊，但我要说的最后一件事实际上是，假设这些都不是真正的选择。你不想成立基金。你没有足够的关系来做 SPV。无论出于什么原因，你不能做 scout。你没有任何钱进行天使投资。你还可以做的一件事就是假装天使投资。[笑] 这并不意味着你要见创始人并开支票，但你可以写备忘录，或者你可以几乎创建一个虚拟投资组合。\n\n这就是 Vedika 在加入我之前在某种程度上做的事情。她在写关于她感兴趣的公司的备忘录。在某些方面，她就像是在得到工作之前就在做这份工作，任何人今天都可以做到这一点。如果你在申请或试图证明你的能力，这也会很有帮助。你可以说，\"嘿，这些是备忘录。这些是我本来会投资的公司，你知道的，如果我有机会的话，你知道的，这是我背后的思考过程。\"\n\n[01:05:49] Lenny: 我喜欢这个。我很好奇了解所有这些初创公司价格的后勤问题，但无论如何，我们不必深入所有 [笑] 这些。这是个很棒的想法。我也在 Twitter 上看到人们这样做。你认为这一切对你来说会走向何方？你在考虑扩大基金吗？这基本上是最后一个问题。就是，是的，Ryan Hoover 此时的未来是什么，就目前而言 [笑] 你知道的？\n\n[01:06:08] Ryan: 是的，仍在思考人生的意义，就像我们之前确定的那样。\n\n[01:06:12] Lenny: 我以为我们已经解决了那个问题。\n\n[01:06:13] Ryan: 是的，是的。当我弄明白时我会告诉你的。\n\n[01:06:15] Lenny: 好的。\n\n[01:06:16] Ryan: [笑]，是的,我们现在正在做第三支基金。\n\n实际上我们只部署了大约30%到35%的资金，所以我们还有充足的资本，而且我们短期内不会融资。是的，我们现在只是在投资早期阶段的公司，但如果展望更长远的未来，我也不知道会怎样。我会一直做投资。而且我更倾向于维持一个较小规模的基金。我们最新的基金是2100万美元，这个可能……我可能会改变想法，但这可能是我们募集的最大规模基金了。下一个基金我可能会保持差不多的规模，因为这真的让我们能够非常协作。我们可以开更小的支票。我们可以参与到竞争激烈的交易中。我认为这对创始人来说是更好的产品。我们不是想要拿下整轮融资。我们可以，你知道，尝试引入像Lenny这样的人作为联合投资人，诸如此类。\n\n所以，投资永远会是我未来的一部分，但我也热爱构建产品。构建产品是最有趣的，所以创造一些东西——不管是一家公司……我不知道——我不知道那会是什么。我甚至不想称它为公司，但构建一些东西希望会在我的未来中出现。我只是需要找到合适的想法。也许，也许也会参考一下你那篇关于想法生成的博客文章，因为那很有帮助。\n\n[01:07:22] Lenny: 只要你让我投资就行。\n\n[01:07:27] Ryan: [笑] 我不知道——我不知道我是否会——我有一部分在想，\"我还想从风投那里融资吗？\"这取决于想法。如果我需要，如果在战略上是必需的，那么会，但说实话，也许我不该这么说，我其实挺想100%拥有一些东西的，而且你总是可以之后再融资。这是一扇单向门，所以对于我接下来要做的任何事情，如果可以的话，我想延迟打开那扇门。\n\n[01:07:53] Lenny: 我100%理解。我的newsletter运营就是这样，我强烈推荐这种方式。\n\n[01:07:59] Ryan: 是的。\n\n[01:07:59] Lenny: 如果你能做到的话。好的。嗯，就这样。最后几个问题——人们可以在哪里找到你？这个问题有点傻，因为你很容易找到，但如果人们想了解更多或者想联系你，应该去哪里？然后听众们怎样可以帮到你？\n\n[01:08:14] Ryan: 是的，我很容易找到。Twitter上是Rhoover，网站是Ryanhoover.me，很简单的网站。上面有我一堆旧博客文章，可能有很多失效的链接和图片，但内容在那里。我不知道。我们在投资——我们在投资早期阶段的公司，B2B、B2C都有。如果你在做一些很独特的东西，我不知道，给我发私信、发邮件，我都在。\n\n[01:08:35] Lenny: 太棒了。Ryan，非常感谢你来到这里。采访你是一种超现实的体验。我很荣幸你能来，我迫不及待想让大家听到这期节目。我真的很高兴能从你脑子里[笑]挖掘出这么多金块，感谢你的分享。谢谢你来这里。\n\n[01:08:52] Ryan: 谢谢，Lenny。是的，这些对话很有帮助，让我反思我到底相信什么。所以，这就像写作一样，很有帮助。\n\n[01:09:00] Lenny: 是的，这对其他所有人也同样有帮助。所以再次感谢你。\n\n[01:09:04] Ryan: 好的。谢谢Lenny。\n\n[01:09:06] Lenny: 非常感谢收听。如果你觉得这期节目有价值，可以在Apple
