What do you do here?\" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer, that ended up being their last day at Apple.\n\n(00:00:23):\nSo there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him and so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally pressed the one to close the door. And it was like doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the closed door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nHe'll never remember my face.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:01:02):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:01:02):\nI disappeared.\n\n(00:01:07):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products.\n\n(00:01:15):\nToday my guest is Camille Hearst.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:04:28):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:29):\nI first wanted to just give a big thank you to Adam Fishman for introducing us who had just so many nice things to say about you and so I'm really excited to be chatting.\n\n(00:04:38):\nI want to start with talking about your current role at Spotify and I believe your role is head of fan monetization. What does that actually entail and what are you responsible for within Spotify?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:04:49):\nAs head of fan monetization, I have a team of folks who are really passionate about figuring out new ways to help artists and fans connect and also figure out ways to make those connections result in new monetization opportunities for the artists.\n\n(00:05:08):\nSo one of the things that we all know and we've seen is how passionate fans are about the artists that they love. You've been following any of the latest bits about the Taylor Swift tour, the Beyoncé tour that's been happening this summer, and their effect on local economies. It's been pretty impressive.\n\n(00:05:28):\nBut one of the things that we also know is it's not just the big huge superstars who have those rabid and super engaged fan bases. People are really passionate just about supporting the artists that they love in general.\n\n(00:05:40):\nAnd on Spotify, we want to figure out ways we can help that result in more money that goes directly to the artist.\n\nLenny (00:05:48):\nWhat are some of those ways just to give people a sense of what might be happening?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:05:52):\nSo one of the ones that most mature is merch which is funny to say because most people probably don't realize that you can purchase merch on Spotify. That's one that's been around-\n\nLenny (00:06:03):\nI did not realize that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:04):\n... for a bit of time and my team's recently been working on making it more prominent, giving artists more ways to offer that merch in the form of a reward for fans. So things like an exclusive discount or an exclusive design or early access because you're a top listener on Spotify, really thinking about thank yous and rewards for your Spotify listenership and fandom.\n\n(00:06:28):\nAnd then other things we've been looking at have been listening parties. We ran a few of those over the past year. I think I talked about it actually on a Spotify event a few years ago. We were running... Sorry, it wasn't a few years ago, it was last year.\n\n(00:06:45):\nBut listening parties is another way and then we've got some new ideas we're exploring.\n\nLenny (00:06:50):\nI've heard people do listening parties with this podcast actually and I hope that you roll that out to podcast too because that would be very cool.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:58):\nYeah. We have all kinds of ideas of really interesting ways we can bring groups of people together and get the monetization going.\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\nAll right.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:08):\nOne day.\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\nMysterious but exciting.\n\n(00:07:11):\nSpeaking of Taylor Swift, I was watching a TikTok the other day and they showed a video of someone inside the concert showing the whole concert and then they panned to the parking lot and there was just tens of thousands of people just standing around in the parking lot listening to the second order music out at the stadium. And I wonder how can you monetize that if there's an opportunity?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:34):\nYeah. I think they often have the merch trucks in those parking lots though one way-\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\nProbably unofficial merch.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:07:40):\nSo you work with artists and I actually wanted to ask this question. What's the best part about working with artists, musical artists, and what's the worst part?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:48):\nI think the best part is working with people who really lean into their creativity and their passion so much so that they do it for a living. And I think a lot of us have creative pursuit and passions and things we love to do and if we made millions of dollars and could retire, what would you do full time? Usually, it's one of these pursuits. But I think it takes an element of bravery, not to mention talent, but you really have to go out on a limb.\n\n(00:08:18):\nAnd so that's this equality that exists in this group of people and it's fun to be around and feel that rub off on you and think, \"Oh, maybe I could take the dive one day and I don't know, go do my calligraphy or learn my ukulele and then do it full time.\" But that's the best part.\n\n(00:08:35):\nAnd the thing I'm really... I grew up in a musical household. My dad's a drummer although his joke when we were growing up was real musicians have day jobs because he had to actually have a job with benefit to support the family and couldn't just be gigging full time.\n\n(00:08:55):\nWhich actually brings me to the flip side of the question which you asked what is the hardest part. I do think we saw this a lot at Patreon and I think you see it especially with musicians and artists, this feeling that you want to give your fans everything that you create and you want to do it for free because you're so enamored with this idea that people really love you and want to support you and they're really responding to your creativity and everything that you're making, you don't want to charge them. But what comes with that is, well, how are you going to make a living.\n\n(00:09:29):\nTo some degree, there has to be a value exchange that happens in order for a creative person to live from their art.\n\n(00:09:37):\nAnd I've found that that's much more pronounced with musicians, this starving artist ethos which makes what I'm trying to do actually quite difficult because a lot of the feedback we get is, \"Oh, that's awesome. I want to have a listening party and have everything be free and just have everyone show up and don't sell anything.\" And we're really looking at it as a way to fans want to support the artists they love, they want to open up their wallets.\n\n(00:10:04):\nYou've see nothing else from a Substack and Patreons that people are actually really happy to be a patron of the arts and they look at it as like a badge of honor.\n\n(00:10:12):\nBut musicians in particular I think tend to shy away from that which makes the kind of thing that I'm working on more difficult.\n\nLenny (00:10:20):\nThis's a great segue to an area I want to spend time on is the creator economy and creators and artists and things like that. And along these lines, I think I have this issue too. I feel bad charging people but there's also... I don't think my stuff is worth enough to charge for and why would anyone ever pay anything for it and so I imagine you see that too. It's just like, \"No one's going to pay for this. It's crazy.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:10:40):\nYeah. It's funny because we live in a very capitalist and market dictate the price kind of society, but on an individual level, particularly when the commodity so to speak is art, there's so many emotions and feelings involved in that that it's hard for someone who's the creator to disassociate themselves from it and see what the market will bear.\n\n(00:11:05):\nWhich is why I actually think it's great that there's platforms who have stepped in and said, \"Hey, we see an opportunity. Let us insert ourselves in the center, let us aggregate, and let us do the hard work of pricing and payment and tax and finance and actually create value where it would be really hard for an individual person who's a creator to do all of this work and facilitate that connection.\" It's almost like the perfect marketplace solution.\n\n(00:11:38):\nBut again, it's hard because if the supplier doesn't want to actually make money in some cases or shies away from optimizing or making money.\n\n(00:11:47):\nAnd then there's the creative process. Sometimes, you're in a flow mode and you're producing a lot and then other times, you're in a drought spell and these things ebb and flow which is why I think companies like Patreon and Substack are really cool because what they try to do is smooth out that revenue and make it so an artist can actually have a predictable... They're not even artist, a creator can have a predictable sustainable paycheck so that they aren't bouncing around from job to job and losing the ability to have that burst of creativity because they're worried about their bills.\n\nLenny (00:12:22):\nI have that experience myself with Substack which is a subscription newsletter and one of the big downsides people don't think about with this life is once you start charging, people start buying, say, an annual subscription and that means I have to at least go for another year and in reality, I never really want to stop it because the revenue would just stop and that would be really sad. So you get on the treadmill where you don't really have an exit path. And I'm not sure exactly where this all goes, but it's been great. But that's something people don't think a lot about is this never ending, keep creating, keep creating life.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:12:52):\nWe call it internally the hamster wheel of content creation. You get on because you love it and then how do you get off.\n\n(00:12:59):\nSo it's actually an interesting challenge again for platforms to think about where can they add value, are there ways to either make the content creation process that much easier and I don't want to say less of a burden because it's not a burden but sometimes, if you don't have time or you're just at a point in life where you can't do it, are there services or things that can be offered, are there things like financing that makes sense for creators that banks or traditional institutions wouldn't offer because of just the difference in the type of work that's being produced.\n\n(00:13:34):\nOr another potential solution is are there ways that platforms can create content. Maybe it's automated so that the creator can take a break. So maybe they're not AI necessarily, maybe it's more just aggregating data or doing summaries or maybe there's just other ideas that haven't been explored out there. But it's a real problem.\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\nSo I have this lennybot.com site which is an AI chatbot based on all my content including the podcast episodes and actually, an engineer who was listening to this podcast reached out and offered to help me build it and he did and it's awesome. And I'm curious if that becomes my retirement plan as the bot ends up just doing this and learns enough. I highly doubt it, but it's fun to experiment with.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:14:18):\nYeah. Use your own content as your large language model, right?\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\nExactly. That's exactly what it is. And I'm curious where this goes.\n\n(00:14:26):\nI want to follow the thread of the creator economy. It feels like there's this huge wave of the creator economies, the future of work, and all these platforms launched to allow creator to make money. But it feels like over the past couple of years, it feels like it faded away. And these very small number of platforms essentially one YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Patreon, maybe Substack, and there was also the sense that the future of work is freelance, everyone's going to be working for themselves, creating stuff, and it feels like people are still working regular jobs. A lot of these startups haven't done great.\n\n(00:15:01):\nSo I guess I'm just curious what you think happens maybe in the next five or 10 years from a perspective of platforms emerging and also just from creators, what... Do you think things stay the same? Do you think there's another wave? Where do you think things go?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:15:14):\nI think it was probably predictable to some degree that platforms would win because just of the nature of aggregation. Once you have either all of the supply or you've aggregated the demand, it's really a strong network effect. Why investors love to invest in these types of businesses, it's hard to break out.\n\n(00:15:37):\nI wouldn't underestimate the strategic ability either of some the big platforms. They were definitely thinking ahead and building features and thinking about whether or not they saw it as a monetization opportunity. It certainly is a great strategic play to make sure that creators felt like they were on the platform that made the most sense for them and they weren't going to churn or leave or try too many other places out.\n\n(00:16:04):\nSo I think the rush and the funding was to figure out is there room for any other new platforms, are there specific vertical that maybe there's an opportunity to create vertical specific features and tooling.\n\n(00:16:19):\nAnd actually, I think we saw a huge massive creation there in Twitch, right? Twitch did not exist and they're just a juggernaut.\n\n(00:16:26):\nI think TikTok is another one that came out of this era. Maybe they weren't positioned as creator economy type startups but effectively...\n\n(00:16:35):\nDid you see what happened in Union Square here with Kai, the gaming streamer?\n\nLenny (00:16:39):\nNo.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:16:39):\nSo I'm in New York and last week, there was a mob and a riot because a Twitch streamer announced that he was going to be giving away PlayStations and computer gear in Union Square and something like a million teenage boys showed up. I'm not making this up. And they had to shut down the center of New York City to clear what turned into protest, riot, mob-\n\nLenny (00:17:07):\nHoly shit.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:08):\n... of teenagers who came for this one creator that probably no one listening to me right now has even heard of.\n\nLenny (00:17:15):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:17):\nSo I do think a lot of the predictions have come to bear. There are tons of people making money and making a living from creating content on the internet.\n\n(00:17:28):\nThere have been studies too where they ask young people what they want to do and what they want to be when they grow up, we quote these at, excuse me, Patreon and over 60% want to create content for a living.\n\n(00:17:42):\nSo those trends I don't think are going anywhere. Maybe it'll be supplemental income, maybe it'll be something you do for a period of your life. But I do think that this area continues to be untapped. I just don't see a world where...\n\n(00:17:58):\nI think of Michelle Phan, right? She's basically a mini Disney and when you think of it like that, she's created IP. What can you do with IP? Comic books, movies, TV shows, plushies, merch. How many millions of Michelle fans are we going to have seen?\n\n(00:18:16):\nLook at what's happening in China. There's tons of creators like this.\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo whether or not the VCs have won or the startups have succeeded, there's no way that you can lower the cost of content creation and increase the scale of distribution and not see this emerge, this creator economy I think emerge. But I think that maybe there's still opportunity for more companies to blossom and to grow and certainly for more individuals maybe do this, figure it out on their own, and do it without too many big platforms getting paid off of their creative pursuit.\n\nLenny (00:18:58):\nHave you seen the NPC trend on TikTok/maybe Instagram Reels where people pretend to be NPCs, non-playable characters, from a video game?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:06):\nI have not.\n\nLenny (00:19:07):\nOkay. It's crazy. People just pretend to be a computer character and people pay them little gifts to do a thing.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:15):\nOh. Is this the... Yes. Have seen it. [inaudible 00:19:19] ice cream, ice cream.\n\nLenny (00:19:22):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:22):\nYes. I didn't realize.\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\nYou're making tens of thousands of dollars a day just... So that's one way to make a living.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:24):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:19:30):\nOn the thread of becoming a creator, you've seen a lot of creators try to do this on Patreon, back at Apple even with iTunes, I want to chat about that, at Spotify now, and even your startup. I'm curious what you've seen is important to success in the creator life, especially things that are maybe not obvious to people. What do people need to get right if they want to pursue that path?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:54):\nOne of the things that I've seen that I don't know if people realize is consistency and predictability of content creation which is where this idea that we were talking about earlier of a hamster wheel kind of comes on.\n\n(00:20:08):\nBut there is something to churning out consistent quality work and putting it out there for your audience to consume and respond and react to that goes a long way. It's almost like the 10,000 hours. You have to do 10,000 hours of something in order to truly master it. But I've seen that time and again.\n\n(00:20:30):\nI started at YouTube in, let's see, how old am I? It must have been 2010. And that was when I really think this whole thing was just first getting going. And we used to put together these playbooks of what made a creator successful because a lot of the effort there was trying to support this burgeoning economy. And I remember even back then in 2010 and to this day, that continues to be one of the top pieces of advice.\n\n(00:20:57):\nAnother one is collaboration. So working with other great creators, sharing audience, exposing one another to those audiences, and then this was something we tried to employ at my startup, Kit. We would actually host events for creators to get together to facilitate meeting and cross pollination in the hopes that it would just benefit their careers. If they were doing YouTube videos with someone they met at the party, then it would be great for all parties all around. So those are two things.\n\n(00:21:32):\nAnd then I do think in a world with all of this content, there continues to be a need and a space for the curator. And curators as creator's kind of an interesting concept. But a curator is almost like what the role at book publishing company plays or a record label plays or a radio station plays, right?\n\n(00:21:56):\nThere is a degree of having a brand, having something you stand for, having a vibe or an ethos and that person being almost, not a gatekeeper in a bad way, but like, \"I, Camille, can't consume anywhere near all this content. You, I trust your vibe. Tell me what I should be listening to.\" And so that would be the third thing I would say is figure out who are those curators who you really can associate your content with who are on the same page as you, have an audience who you think would like your stuff and just try and get associated with them.\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\nYeah. The last piece is so... I totally see that all the time. If there's someone I super respect and they recommend something, I'm obviously going to value that recommendation highly. That's like we're influencing emerged from organically, right? People just, \"Here's something you should check out,\" and then, \"Oh, let's pay you to share things so that people try our product.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:22:48):\nThat was the exact concept behind my startup, Kit. It was all about curating, finding people who are great recommenders for gear, having them curate that gear, and then you could follow the curators you love who wants to go look on Amazon and see reviews from people you've never heard of. Oftentimes, if it's your brother-in-law who's a great cyclist and they say, \"Buy this,\" you just buy it. You don't even care what the reviews say because you trust that person.\n\nLenny (00:23:14):\nWhat happened with the startup and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:23:17):\nI started working on the startup in 2015. We managed to raise some money, raised over $2 million, which is a huge accomplishment, especially if you know anything about venture capital. They have a horrible track record when it comes to funding people of color, women, people who are non-cisgender white male, just the track record.\n\n(00:23:43):\nAnd we had an amazing experience building this company over several years, grew a bunch of the key metrics up into the right and got to a point where we were trying to figure out what the next move was and should we get a bridge round. We were trying to raise Series A. We were, I think, early on the creator economy trend. Probably about a year and a half later, it would've been, I think, I hope a snap to raise money. But anyway, we were battling a bunch of different choices, different options.\n\n(00:24:19):\nAnd I actually did this startup accelerator called StartX that's run out of Stanford which is my alma mater. And we learned a lot about how to sell a company and what M&A looks like. So we started exploring that path.\n\n(00:24:34):\nAnd in the end, it made the most sense for us to have an exit and join forces with Patreon. And so that's what we ended up doing. Sold the company in 2018, joined Patreon, worked there a couple of years, and that's where I met Adam.\n\nLenny (00:24:49):\nAmazing. And I wanted to ask actually about that experience of selling a company. There's a lot of people listening right now who are thinking about selling their company or maybe you hope to sell their company someday, and I think there's a reality of it and then there's the idea of how it might go. I'm curious what you've taken away from that experience. And I guess specifically is there any advice you could share with folks that are thinking about selling their company someday? What you think maybe could have done earlier or also just share a glimpse of the reality of acquisitions?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:25:20):\nI think it's different for every company for sure. Some companies get souped in and get bought. And other companies actively sell themselves.\n\n(00:25:31):\nWe are definitely in the latter camp which means that we manage a process. It's similar to how you manage a process for fundraising. Not every company just meets the VC and raises money on the first try. They go through a process and meet tons of VCs and put them through the funnel and end up on the other side hopefully with a successful round. So I think that's one takeaway is treat it like a process and manage it like a process if it is something you're interested in. It doesn't really just... For most companies, I would say it doesn't just happen.\n\n(00:26:04):\nAnd then the second piece of advice I would give I think we should have been talking to potential acquirers from the beginning and sharing our vision and what we were trying to accomplish because we started those quite late in our journey as a company and it just meant it took... When I met a potential CPO, who would acquire the company, who would end up being my boss or CEO, it was their first time meeting me whereas if it had been their fifth time, we would've had a relationship established and they would've known more about the vision and what we're trying to do and hopefully, would've had some more time to think about it.\n\n(00:26:42):\nSo those would be my two pieces of advice. Start preparing to sell your company from the moment you found it which is a weird thing because obviously, if you're starting a company, for most founders, they want it to be the next big thing, they're not starting it in order to sell it, but it's a good thing to have on your radar because you never know what the future holds. And then two is to treat it like a process.\n\nLenny (00:27:07):\nYeah. On that piece of knowing people who may acquire you, I found that to be a thousand percent true. We sold our company the Airbnb and that's how it got to Airbnb and what I realized is you just need people who may buy you in the future to have you in their head when they have a problem so that they could be like, \"Oh, Camille and her team could solve this problem for us. Let's go chat with her and-\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:28):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:27:28):\n... see if they're interested in acquisition.\"\n\n(00:27:31):\nAnd on the process piece too, 1000% resonates. We basically... When we started chatting with a company, we're just like, \"Okay, who else could potentially acquire us? Let's make a big list and who we can talk to at that company as soon as possible and then just explore.\" But it's more challenging there because it's you reaching out to them being like, \"Hey, you want to chat about buying our company,\" versus them reaching out to you. So to your point, always goes better if they reach out to you, but you can't always control that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:54):\nRight. Or if the meeting is not under the context of buying it all, it's like, \"We're working on something cool. We have a great vision. It aligns with what you're doing. Maybe there's a partnership here,\" versus just tell you what we're doing and then when I contact you in 12 months about buying me, you've heard of me before.\n\nLenny (00:28:12):\nI find even when you're starting to chat about acquisitions, you never want to say directly, \"Hey, you want to buy us?\" It's like, \"Hey, you want to have a strategic partnership of some kind? You want to explore partnership?\" So funny.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:28:23):\nLike dating.\n\nLenny (00:28:24):\nYeah, yeah. You can't just be too direct sometimes.\n\n(00:28:28):\nSo when you got to Patreon, I don't know if it was immediate or eventually you ended up leading the creator side of the marketplace, and I find that looking at your background, you basically stayed on the supply side of marketplaces through your career mostly.\n\n(00:28:43):\nAnd I actually did the same thing. All I worked on at Airbnb especially, or mostly, was the host side.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd I think it takes a specific mindset in person to be excited about that side of the marketplace versus the consumer side which is where everyone always generally wants to go, to the customer side. So I'm curious what it is that's drawn you to that side of the business across all the places you work and then just what you found to be important to be successful in that role and on that side?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:29:09):\nWhat drew me to that side of the business probably was maybe accidental at the beginning. Just again, coming from this musical family and background, I always had a natural interest in helping artists make a living. So I think that interest was there.\n\n(00:29:29):\nAt Apple, I did... There were only two PMs there. We did everything.\n\n(00:29:34):\nAt YouTube, I accidentally ended up in creator.\n\n(00:29:39):\nBut where I started understanding deeply the dynamics of the marketplace was actually my experience and the one job I've had that not been in the creator or art or these big consumer platforms or creator economy which was at a startup called Hailo based out of London and at the time was a huge competitor to Uber and Lyft in the ride sharing and ride hailing space and I worked on the supply side making sure that there were enough cars to fuel the demand.\n\n(00:30:17):\nAnd in a marketplace like that where it's real time people trying to get a cab to go from uptown to downtown, you see the inexperience firsthand the impact to your business if you don't have suppliers, if your suppliers aren't happy, if they go on strike, if there's regulations that mean you can't use your service. And there I think I was...\n\n(00:30:44):\nSo one of the projects that I worked on that I launched was the U.S. Uber competitor because Hailo in Europe was all about getting taxi cabs and did not play in the livery is what it's called in New York or the private rides. Basically, it's like your uncle or your aunt or your cousin who can switch on Lyft and go pick up whoever. That just was not a thing in Europe.\n\n(00:31:09):\nAnd so we had to figure out how to launch that in the U.S., how to get drivers on how to create this supply and it was like it doesn't matter how nice the user experience is, how great the marketing is, how much demand you can generate if when someone opens that app, there are no cars available.\n\n(00:31:31):\nSo a lot of people talk about marketplaces as chicken and egg. I actually just think they're two-sided and you start with the supply and at the end of the day, you can optimize for the demand side or choose who you're going to prioritize in terms of if there's a conflict, we're going to pick this side or the other.\n\n(00:31:53):\nAnd yes, you won't be successful with one side or the other but I just experienced and lived firsthand the pain of having built this great operations back in that fed into this gray UI and then you open that app and you can't get a ride because there aren't enough cars available.\n\n(00:32:12):\nSo I think that solidified my feeling that with marketplaces, you can't lose sight of the solving real pain points and needs for the supply side in order to make sure the entire business can operate.\n\nLenny (00:32:26):\nI've done a bunch of research into marketplaces and I found basically the same thing, that supply is almost always where you need to focus almost all your time especially at the beginning.\n\n(00:32:34):\nThe way I think about it is that's if you have a store that's stuff on your shelves and you're not going to have a business if you don't have anything on the shelves.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:32:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\nThere's a few rare cases, I forget exactly which they were, where demand was actually the bigger challenge and supply is really easy.\n\n(00:32:47):\nYou know what? It was Rover. Rover had no problem it turns out with supply because who wouldn't want to make 50 bucks watching a dog for a few hours. It was a really easy sell and a lot of people could do it and wanted to do it so they actually found supply was not an issue.\n\n(00:33:01):\nBut in most cases exactly how you said most 10 times supply is what people are looking for.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:05):\nTotally.\n\n(00:33:06):\nI find that the counter example I hear a lot is eBay, how they were so good at aggregating demand, they were basically able to force suppliers to the terms that they like. But I can't imagine... It'd be interesting to talk to some folks who were at eBay in their early days that the whole thing didn't start up without them going out and figuring out who are the key suppliers we need to get on this thing so that we can get aggregating demand.\n\nLenny (00:33:32):\nYeah. You got to have some good stuff on eBay. I wonder if Beanie Babies or whatever they started with.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:37):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:33:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

So you said you were the second PM on iTunes back in the day and I'm curious what you learned from the experience you had working at Apple. I think I read somewhere you worked maybe closely with Steve Jobs and Jony Ive, but I don't know if that's true, but I'm curious just... No? Okay, but you do have a Steve Jobs story?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:34:57):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:34:58):\nOkay.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:35:00):\nYes. So I was very early on in the iTunes days I started interning there when I came out of grad school and my internship was actually in label relation and then I started a full-time job doing product marketing.\n\n(00:35:17):\nAnd at Apple at the time, I think even to this day, they didn't have a product manager title, they had product marketing managers. And so one of my colleagues who remains good friends to this day, Steve was the first also named Steve, not Steve Jobs was the first PMM working on iTunes and he primarily was doing all the client stuff. He launched the store and everything. But I think I was the second person in the iTunes group with that title. So that was really cool.\n\n(00:35:44):\nAnd then as far as the Steve Jobs story, I would think I mentioned to you people like hearing this story, nothing happened, I just went up to him and said, \"Hi, I'll tell the story.\"\n\n(00:35:53):\nBut I think the context of why people find it interesting is because of other stories about Steve. So let me give a little context.\n\n(00:36:01):\nThose Steve Jobs lore was that if you were in an elevator with him, you better be prepared to talk about what you do at the company because he had a habit of getting in the elevator and looking at you and saying, \"What do you do? What do you do here?\" And there were also rumors that people who had not given him a good answer that ended up being their last day at Apple.\n\n(00:36:24):\nSo there was someone who I didn't know personally but worked in my department before I got there who got in an elevator and looked up and Steve was approaching him. And so he went to press the button to open the door and accidentally press the one to close the door and was doing this press... You can't see me if you're listening on podcast but frantically pressing the button, trying to open the door, but accidentally pressing the close door button and the elevator going to its destination. And apparently he got off and just bolted straight up, ran down the hallway.\n\nLenny (00:37:02):\nHe'll never remember my face.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:03):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:37:04):\nI disappeared.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:04):\nSo that's the context.\n\n(00:37:07):\nSo in 2005, it's my first day of my internship at Apple and I had this situation where I attended graduation because I only had one semester left to go back to, so I just decided to attend the graduation. That happened basically the week before. And for those of you who are the job span, this is when he gave his really inspiring and famous Stanford commencement speech and it's an awesome, awesome thing to listen to.\n\nLenny (00:37:41):\nYou were at that speech?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:42):\nI was there, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:37:42):\nWhoa. People love that speech.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:47):\nIt's a good one. It's really-\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\nWhat did you feel being there listening to it in the moment?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:51):\nTotally inspired.\n\n(00:37:54):\nApple was not quite what it is today in terms of brand and influence and just it's at the peak. It's really come a long way. It was still when I met the recruiter at a conference, I was like, \"Apple? What do they do again? My roommate had a Mac, but what's iTunes? Oh, yeah, I think I've heard of that. I think...\"\n\n(00:38:19):\nThe dancing iPod silhouette ads which really sent Apple over the top. Those hadn't even really dropped yet, but it was starting, right? It was starting to percolate and bubble and you heard more and more about it and just the association with music was making Apple more cool.\n\n(00:38:35):\nBut that speech is... Talk about a commencement speech. That is top-notch.\n\n(00:38:41):\nAnd Steve's great at those. He was phenomenal storyteller.\n\n(00:38:44):\nSo graduation is what? Saturday, I go home Sunday. The Monday I started my internship and here we are at Cafe Max with my new coworkers and Steve is sitting literally at the table next to me. And so I was like, \"Oh my gosh, there's Steve. I would love to say hi and introduce myself and everyone at the table.\"\n\n(00:39:09):\nNow mind you, I hadn't heard this story about the elevator button in the full yet because it was my first day, but they're all looking at each other. They're like, \"Yeah, go say hi to him if you want, but you're an intern.\" They say, \"Hopefully, he doesn't fire you on your first day.\"\n\n(00:39:22):\nBut I've always, in my family and in my life, had this encouragement to say hi to people when you see them and let them know that you appreciate what they do and just thank them because it doesn't happen often.\n\n(00:39:39):\nA lot of times, people go and they ask for a picture or an autograph but this idea of just introducing yourself, saying hello, and thanking someone for something that they've done that impacted you to something that's been a way that my parents have encouraged me to behave in the world and something that I saw them do and saw them model because probably, again, coming from my dad being a musician and being fans of other musicians that like a thing in music, the artist culture that talked to one another about how something you created influenced you or whatnot.\n\n(00:40:09):\nSo I went up to him and I got up from my lunch table and walked over and I said, \"Hi, my name's Camille. I'm interning here this summer. It's my first day. I was at graduation at Stanford on Saturday and your speech was amazing. I was really inspired. I'm so excited to be here and so excited to work on this company and I just wanted to say thank you for spending your time doing that speech for us on Saturday.\"\n\n(00:40:38):\nAnd he was like, \"Who are you? What? You're an intern? Well, what are you doing here?\" It was a little... We had a little bit of an exchange. I had to clarify like, \"Yeah, I graduated, but I'm interning and I have another semester left.\" And he was like, \"Oh, okay. Well, welcome to Apple and good luck and I hope you have a really great experience this summer.\" And that was it. I didn't get fired and I said hello to Steve.\n\n(00:41:01):\nAnd after that, I felt like I knew him. Every time, I'd see him around campus I'd wave high and I think he had no idea who I was but he would look at me confused and then wave back hello.\n\nLenny (00:41:12):\n\"She's so friendly. Who's this person?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:41:15):\nDo you still remember how you would've described what you do? I have a feeling it's seared in your head, but if not, then never mind.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:21):\nOh, my statement, if he had asked me where [inaudible 00:41:23].\n\nLenny (00:41:23):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:24):\nWell, yeah, I was lucky because one of the things that I did he would actually know exactly what it is which is I would manage press rooms whenever there was an iTunes launch. So this is very much grunt work.\n\n(00:41:38):\nBut when there would be a press event for one of the new iTunes 6 launch or whatever, they would have interviews with Walter Isaacson or I don't know if Kara Swisher was working back then, but whoever the journalist and Steve would have a room set up with an iMac computer with an iTunes library full of track. There would be whatever the new iPod was synced to that computer and all of the track. And after every interview, everything would have to be reset.\n\n(00:42:10):\nAlso, the library was crafted so he would give feedback for months on the content of the library because he would do demos. And so he wanted to know, \"Make sure all my favorite tracks are in there, my favorite Beatles records, my favorite Bob Dylan records, and who's this artist? Let me check them out. Okay, they don't cross the bar. Oh, what's this song? Oh, I love this song. Oh, add this.\" So he was very involved in the entire presentation and someone had to go do all that.\n\n(00:42:38):\nSo who better than the fresh out of masters of engineering in Stanford graduate student to go do all of the grunt work of making library? But those are the kinds of details that he paid attention to. And so I would've just told him that I did product marketing and one of my main responsibilities was fixing the press room for him and he would've been like, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:01):\nYou mentioned that your title is product marketing manager and there was a recent kind of a hubbub on Twitter where Brian Chesky at Airbnb shared that they shifted the role of product manager to essentially the Apple model. And I'm curious what your perspective is on that approach to product, the Apple kind of way versus a traditional product manager?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:21):\nThey have done this very intentionally from what I've seen. I know they hired Hiroki actually from Apple-\n\nLenny (00:43:29):\nYeah. A lot of Apple people.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:31):\nYeah. And actually one of the new leaders they've hired, I don't know if you know Judson Coplan, dear friend of mine, we interned that same summer at Apple and he worked there for 15 years before heading over to Airbnb.\n\n(00:43:45):\nBut yeah, the Apple construct, it's much more of design and engineering led organizations, craftspeople I would say more so than strategy people. So that was one of the stark differences I saw in my transition from Apple to Google. There are a lot more like people from Coca-Cola and McKinsey and Bain at Google. I don't think any of those people even existed at Apple.\n\n(00:44:15):\nAnd it was very much like, \"Let's 3D chess our way into what our next move is going to be.\" Whereas at Apple it was, \"Let's tinker and let's craft and let's build and let's see what feels right.\" There's different approaches. As a result, the approach to product management was quite different.\n\n(00:44:33):\nSo I think it makes sense. Brian Chesky's background is a designer so it probably resonates a bit more within the Apple way.\n\n(00:44:41):\nAnd then in terms of what it means for product managers on an individual level, so again, there weren't product managers, the closest thing would've been CPMs, technical program managers who help manage the sprints and manage the schedule and listing out what features would happen.\n\n(00:44:59):\nI spent a lot of my time with the incredibly talented design team and if I had ideas of product features or... We would think months ahead of time, like what's the anchor story or what are the three key messages for the launch of iTunes 10 or whatever and we might have ideas for new features that would go in that.\n\n(00:45:19):\nBut because we had that moment in time, we knew well ahead we were planning for and you were working on the messaging and working on the consumer positioning again while in advance of anything actually being live or built. That was what framed what features you wanted to build and what problems you would put on the table to be solved as opposed to as clear cut metric you're trying to drive forward which is how product management has evolved in another capacity.\n\nLenny (00:45:52):\nAnd that's how it works at most companies.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:45:52):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:45:54):\nI want to come back actually to the creator economy stuff. I feel like you've worked in the creator economy longer than most anyone, and so I wanted to use our time to spend a little more time there. What about on the platform side? If someone were thinking about starting a company to cater to creators, to build a new platform maybe for creators to make a living, do you have any advice for them? Where do you think maybe there's opportunity? Where do you think it's like, \"No, probably you don't want to spend time here?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:46:24):\nI think with any company, solving a real problem is the most important thing. So creators have lots of challenges and things that can be solved. Some painful things are more acutely felt than others.\n\n(00:46:40):\nI think at the core, every creator needs two things. They need to grow an audience and they need to get paid so that they can make a living. And in some ways, I do think that growing an audience is more important because with that audience, it opens up opportunities in ways that you can monetize.\n\n(00:46:59):\nBut there are all kinds of other things like we're talking about financing, health insurance, the list goes on, things we face as human beings, trying to be freelancers in the world often apply equally to people who are creative for a living.\n\n(00:47:14):\nAnd then there are unique things about the creator space like the spurts of energy, the spurts of creative flow that maybe don't apply in a salary job or an hourly job.\n\n(00:47:28):\nSo there are lots of problems out there still to be solved for creators. I don't think that this space is nearly solved, done, stick a fork in it. So my advice would be to look at the problems that exist and pick a real one and go for it.\n\nLenny (00:47:47):\nWise advice.\n\n(00:47:49):\nHave you seen this podcaster, Bobbi, I forget her last name, she rocketed up to the fourth biggest podcast in America with a few episodes of her podcast, she interviews Drake and a few comedians. Have you seen this person?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:05):\nI feel like I should, but as we said at the beginning, I'm such a music head, I don't listen to any podcast.\n\nLenny (00:48:11):\nThe reason I thought of her is I was watching a clip of her on an interview show and she hasn't made any money from this even though she's got the hottest podcast in America right now, and we're going to link to her in the show notes, but she's hilarious.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:25):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny (00:48:25):\nThere's something about her that just is really fun to watch. But okay, no podcast for you right now. We'll get you on a podcast. You're on the podcast.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:32):\nI'm on a podcast now.\n\nLenny (00:48:34):\nThere we go.\n\n(00:48:36):\nYou've mentioned your parents and I was reading your Wikipedia page and the way your parents are described on there is radical Buddhist artists technologists. I'm curious what that means maybe and then also just is there a memory or moment of growing up that highlights that aspect of them?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nWhat's funny about this is I had no idea how to Wikipedia page until you sent that.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nWhat?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nI don't know where it came from.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nOh my God. Who made this?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nThat's amazing.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:08):\nLike, \"What? I'm on Wikipedia?\" So that was funny.\n\nLenny (00:49:08):\nThat's crazy.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:13):\nYeah.\n\n(00:49:13):\nSo let's see. I grew up in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties. My parents started practicing Buddhism on the East Coast in the seventies. And my dad was, I mentioned he's a drummer and a musician, and he also had a studio. We had this closet under the stairs that he turned into a production studio and he was an artist.\n\n(00:49:43):\nHe worked for the city. My mom worked for the city, didn't have a ton of money growing up, and so a lot of the computer equipment came from the street. He would find... Somebody put a PC out... He was building PCs before the gamers were doing it. And I remember he would come home with boxes and boards and chips and would literally go get a book from the library or the store and would figure out how to assemble these computers, keyboards that were broken. He would just fix them. Probably should have been a mechanical engineer, super talented at this stuff.\n\n(00:50:15):\nBut basically he had this entire production studio with drum machines and all the equipment. And I was his helper. So I would help him solder stuff together and tinker and actually put these computers together. So that's probably... I don't know where that quote came from. I'll have to go click the link of what the reference is from, but that's some of the background there.\n\n(00:50:42):\nAnd the other thing that happened back in San Francisco in the eighties and nineties, we used to host Buddhist meetings in our house and back then there was a lot of what was called street propagation like the Hare Krishna used to be up and down Haight Street right around the corner for me.\n\n(00:51:01):\nThe Nation of Islam, which my brother joined for a period of time, would be selling Final Calls and bean pie brothers on the corners.\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\nYes.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:51:10):\nSo The Final Call is the newspaper at the time for the Nation of Islam.\n\n(00:51:15):\nAnd so it was just a different era, completely different from today, and us practicing Nichiren Buddhism, we had pamphlet that said, \"Nam myoho renge kyo,\" on them, and I would stand on the steps of our house and... We had a gate. So I would stand behind the gate and I'm probably seven or eight years old, just ask people walking by, \"Hey, if you're a nam myoho renge kyo, here's a pamphlet. Learn a little more. We're having a meeting at our house.\"\n\n(00:51:40):\nI'd laugh with my mom now. She's like, \"I can't believe we're doing that.\" It seems totally crazy now but at the time, it was just, again, coming off of the seventies, it was a very different era.\n\n(00:51:49):\nIf you've ever seen What's Love Got To Do With It, Tina Turner's probably... Who recently passed away, probably one of the more famous, more well-known practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism and she actually started practicing in the same kind of era, seventies and eighties... Or seventies probably.\n\n(00:52:05):\nSo that's what that means. And those are a couple memories that illustrate that moment. But you can see, music, technology, helping creators get paid, it's certainly influenced everything about how I am today.\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\nThat was a perfect description of your parents based on those stories. And it feels inevitable that you would've ended up doing what you're doing now. Product, technology, music, artists, creators. So that's amazing.\n\n(00:52:33):\nI'm going to ask one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round, and the question is just around frameworks. Is there just a favorite framework or process or system or approach to building product or teams that you come back to and/or to share often that you think might be useful to listeners?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:52:51):\nI have this great manager in my experience at Hailo who turned me on to Marty Cagan who I since befriended and learned a ton from. And I just love the way that-\n\nLenny (00:52:51):\nReally?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:53:03):\nYeah, he's awesome. Actually, I should ask him about early days at eBay because I think he was there probably one of the people who got off the ground.\n\n(00:53:12):\nBut one of the things that I learned and that we really emphasized during that time is this idea of having dual track agile going where you're doing discovery and delivery simultaneously and doing it in a way that's not waterfall.\n\n(00:53:29):\nIt's not like, \"All right, the designers are going to go over here and tinker for months, and then once we've figured it out, we'll lob it over the wall to the coders and cross our fingers and hope everything works.\" But rather having this continuous cycle of essentially de-risking your assumption and getting to a point where you're able to do that with speed so that you can chart your way to new paths and to innovation by constantly figuring out where the errors are in your thinking or where things that you didn't expect to happen were going to happen.\n\n(00:54:04):\nSo I think everyone knows an impact effort or risk reward two by two and can map out different opportunities and things you might do on that two by two.\n\n(00:54:16):\nBut one of my favorite takeaways from that is that from this way of working around this dual track agile de-risking your riskiest ideas first approach is a concept of taking the things in the top, the biggest swing and actually prioritizing those first in terms of product discovery and figuring out what can you do to start de-risking because if you constantly put those off in favor of the lower risk or more predictable smaller swings, how are you ever going to truly innovate and get to the next level.\n\n(00:54:53):\nIt's a less safe choice. So it's someone that as a leader, you are in the hot seat and you can take accountability. So if some of these things don't pan out, it's on you and not on your team and give your team permission to fail and try things and de-risk those risky assumptions and get them to a point where they become low risk and they become predictable and you can just put them in the delivery column and execute them.\n\nLenny (00:55:18):\nIt reminds me of this piece of advice that people call eat the frog which is first thing in the morning eat the frog which essentially is do the hardest thing first and then there's the day becomes easier.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:30):\nI don't know why it's eat a frog, I don't know where that comes from.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:34):\nI don't know either. I like draw the owl. That's one of my favorite values, the Twilio ones.\n\nLenny (00:55:39):\nSay more. I would say more. What is that?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:44):\nCompanies have their values. One of them is draw the owl. It's really draw the effing owl and the meme is how do you draw an owl and you draw some circles and then you draw a fucking owl. So it's like just do it. At some point, you got to just figure it out and figure out how to do it.\n\n(00:56:10):\nExcuse my language, but it's funnier when you say what the value actually is which is sometimes you got to just go for it. You're not going to know the exact path to get there and maybe you won't have de-risked everything but you start with some circles and then you get it done.\n\nLenny (00:56:27):\nI love it. Cursing is very loud on this podcast, so I'm glad you went there.\n\n(00:56:32):\nAnd with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:36):\nI hope so. I didn't prepare this. I thought I'd figured out on the spot.\n\nLenny (00:56:40):\nGreat. Perfect.\n\n(00:56:41):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:46):\nThree-Body Problem, A Wrinkle in Time, and Octavia Butler's Kindred.\n\nLenny (00:56:53):\nThree-Body Problem's come up a number of times recently and there's a show coming out actually based on the book.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:58):\nI'm excited. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:59):\nI'm so excited. I've been watching Foundation which is also another series I've been excited to see, but it's like, I don't know what's going on. It's so complicated.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:07):\nHow is it? I've been waiting...\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\nEh.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:08):\nSo I'm a huge sci-fi head. I watched Battlestar Galactica. Classic. [inaudible 00:57:16] and so I've been waiting to see what happens with Foundation because I just don't have that kind of commitment in me these days.\n\nLenny (00:57:23):\nYeah. I don't know what to think of it. It's beautiful and there's a lot of interesting pieces but it just goes out... I think they're making a lot of stuff up. I don't know if you've read Silo. Have you read Silo?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:33):\nNo. But I saw the preview for the show. Another one I'm going to [inaudible 00:57:36] season two.\n\nLenny (00:57:37):\nThat's a good one to read because in the show... They're just making up stories. I don't know what they're doing. There's... Ninety percent of it, they just totally invent for the show and then there's a little bit that's connected to the story so I don't know what's going on.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:49):\nOkay. Cool. I didn't even know it was a book. I'll read it.\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nOh, yeah. It's really good. There's three of them, but the first one's the only good one, so I found.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:54):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:57:55):\nAnyway, moving on. Speaking of this topic actually, any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you've really enjoyed?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:02):\nI've been watching Hijack over the last week with Idris Elba. So that's been fun. Got a couple episodes left there.\n\n(00:58:10):\nAnd then movies, I'm a huge Chris Nolan fan. So I haven't seen Oppenheimer yet, but can't wait to see it. Most of his movies I'm confused by, but the visuals are just so stunning if you let it go.\n\nLenny (00:58:24):\nYeah. I'm excited to see it too. I've not seen it either. Have a new child and it's harder to see movies [inaudible 00:58:30].\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:30):\nOh, another good one. Shadow and Bone on Netflix.\n\nLenny (00:58:34):\nShadow and Bone?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:35):\nWay better than the book I have to say. Well, I read one series, the Six of Crows. This is my young adult sci-fi fantasy streak. Again, coming to the forth. But the show is incredible. It is so good. So if you're into-\n\nLenny (00:58:35):\nReally? Never heard that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:48):\n... this kind of vibe, go for it.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nOkay. I'm going to check that out.\n\n(00:58:52):\nWhat is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:58:58):\nI like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished and take me through the process and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nWhat is a favorite life motto that you just really like to share or often come back to either in work or in life?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:31):\nYeah. So there's one which is actually a Japanese proverb. I took Japanese in high school and college but this phrase is a frog in a well cannot know the ocean. And so the idea is to push yourself to expand your limits and your horizons and get out of the well so that you can experience the ocean.\n\nLenny (00:59:31):\nI love that.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:55):\nI got a better one, sorry.\n\nLenny (00:59:57):\nOkay, great. Go.\n\nCamille Hearst (00:59:58):\nAnother one.\n\nLenny (00:59:58):\nSure. Tell me.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:00:00):\nI learned this one from someone at Patreon because someone was posting this around the streets of San Francisco. It's become more known recently. Apparently, it's a Chinese proverb. I don't know if it's true or not but it is that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. So this idea that don't delay, maybe you missed the prime opportunity but waiting any longer certainly isn't going to help.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nI heard that one actually I was at the park in San Francisco and there was this piano thing, I think it was called, it's a botanical garden and people play piano all throughout once a year. And there's a guy that was just playing incredibly well and I left and he left around the same time and I was standing next to him. I'm like, \"Man, I wish I studied piano when I was younger.\" And he's like, \"The best time to have studied piano is 10 years ago. The second best time is to start now.\"\n\nCamille Hearst (01:00:51):\nYep, he's right.\n\nLenny (01:00:53):\nAnd I couldn't get off the hook there. He is like, \"You're right. And you're still not going to do it I guess.\"\n\n(01:00:59):\nFinal question, who's a favorite artist right now? Who are you liking?\n\nCamille Hearst (01:01:05):\nOoh. So I've been for probably a good three years now really into Afrobeat and right now there's this artist called Rema, R-E-M-A, who I first heard a couple years ago, he's got this track called Dumebi. But he has a song out right now that is, my opinion, song of the summer called Calm Down. I think Ariana Grande, is it, came over and did a verse on it? But I've just been listening to Rema Radio, Calm Down radio on Spotify and tons of Afrobeats artists. So that's the vibe I'm on right now.\n\nLenny (01:01:42):\nI love it. I actually... Once someone suggested some music at the end of a podcast and I was just like, \"Hey, we're going to end the podcast with that tune.\" And it turned out we did that and then YouTube shut us down because it's copyrighted and so I'm not going to offer. Never going to do that again, so we're just ending with regular music but we'll link-\n\nCamille Hearst (01:01:59):\n[inaudible 01:01:59] it's hard.\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\nI know. It's so tough. Come on. It's just like a few seconds. Give us a break.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:06):\nYou should have 30 seconds for your play. Right?\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nI don't know. Maybe we'll-\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:07):\nDon't ask me, I'm not a lawyer.\n\nLenny (01:02:10):\nWe'll send you the bill.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:12):\nCamille, this was amazing. I think we're living the creator economy here. I really appreciate you making time for this.\n\n(01:02:17):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask any additional questions? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:24):\nI used to be real big on Twitter but that ship has sailed. I'm still on there. You can find me-\n\nLenny (01:02:30):\nIt's X now.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:31):\nYes, on X. Camillionz is my handle, C-A-M-I-L-L-I-O-N-Z. Also on Threads these days, trying that out, seeing if that sticks. So probably LinkedIn. You could find me on LinkedIn. I don't think anyone ever promotes that.\n\nLenny (01:02:31):\nThey do. Most people actually.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:48):\nDo they? Yeah?\n\nLenny (01:02:48):\nYeah.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:02:52):\nOkay.\n\n(01:02:52):\nAnd how can listeners be useful to me? Hey, go support your favorite creator. Find out, go to the show, find out if they have a Patreon. I would love to see more and more people feeling like they are patrons of the arts.\n\nLenny (01:03:08):\nAmazing. Maybe buy some merch.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:03:09):\nBuy some merch. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:12):\nCamille, thank you again for being here.\n\nCamille Hearst (01:03:13):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:03:15):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:03:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "Camille Hearst (00:00:00):\n...关于 Steve Jobs 有个传说，如果你在电梯里遇到他，你最好准备好谈谈你在公司做什么，因为他有个习惯，就是进电梯后看着你说：\"你是做什么的？你在这里做什么？\"还有传言说，那些没能给他一个好答案的人，那天就成了他们在 Apple 的最后一天。\n\n(00:00:23):\n所以有个人，我不认识他，但在我到那里之前他在我的部门工作过。他进了电梯，抬头一看 Steve 正朝他走来，所以他去按开门按钮，结果不小心按到了关门按钮。就像这样按...如果你在听播客可能看不到我，但就是疯狂地按按钮，想要开门，却不小心按了关门按钮，然后电梯就到了目的地。显然他下电梯后就直接冲了出去，沿着走廊跑掉了。\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\n他永远不会记得我的脸。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:01:02):\n对，就是这样。\n\nLenny (00:01:02):\n我消失了。\n\n(00:01:07):\n欢迎来到 Lenny's Podcast，在这里我会采访世界级的产品领导者和增长专家，学习他们在打造和增长当今最成功产品过程中艰辛获得的经验。\n\n(00:01:15):\n今天我的嘉宾是 Camille Hearst。Camille 是 Spotify 粉丝变现业务负责人。在此之前，她是 Patreon 创作者产品负责人，曾担任 YouTube 的产品营销经理，还是 iTunes 的第二位 PM。她也是一位前创业者，创办了一家叫 Kit 的公司，后来卖给了 Patreon。\n\n(00:01:31):\n这期节目适合对创作者领域感兴趣的人，无论是从创作者角度还是平台角度，或者你只是想听听一位优秀产品领导者的有趣故事。\n\n(00:01:42):\n我们会聊到创作者平台的未来，如何成为一名成功的创作者，以及如何成为一个新的创作者平台，创作者生活的负面因素，还有框架方法、Steve Jobs 的故事、创作者变现的方式等等。\n\n(00:01:56):\n在我们赞助商的简短介绍后，请享受与 Camille Hearst 的这期节目。\n\n(00:02:02):\n本期节目由 Merge 赞助。每位产品经理都知道，当开发人员必须构建和维护与其他平台的集成时，产品开发会变得多么缓慢。\n\n(00:02:12):\nMerge 的统一 API

介绍我们认识，他对你有很多好评，所以我真的很期待这次对话。\n\n(00:04:38):\n我想先聊聊你在 Spotify 的现任职位，我相信你的职位是粉丝变现业务负责人。这具体包括什么，你在 Spotify 负责什么工作？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:04:49):\n作为粉丝变现业务负责人，我有一个团队，他们真正热衷于找出新方法来帮助艺人和粉丝建立联系，同时找到让这些联系为艺人带来新变现机会的方法。\n\n(00:05:08):\n我们都知道并且看到粉丝对他们喜爱的艺人有多么热情。如果你关注了今年夏天关于 Taylor Swift 巡演、Beyoncé 巡演的最新消息，以及它们对当地经济的影响，那真的很令人印象深刻。\n\n(00:05:28):\n但我们也知道的一件事是，不仅仅是那些超级巨星拥有那些狂热和高度参与的粉丝群体。总的来说，人们真的很热衷于支持他们喜爱的艺人。\n\n(00:05:40):\n在 Spotify，我们想找出方法，让这些支持能够直接转化为更多流向艺人的收入。\n\nLenny (00:05:48):\n能举一些例子让大家了解一下可能会有什么吗？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:05:52):\n最成熟的一个是周边商品，说起来有点好笑，因为大多数人可能都不知道你可以在 Spotify 上购买周边。这个功能已经存在一段时间了——\n\nLenny (00:06:03):\n我还真不知道。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:04):\n...我的团队最近一直在努力让它更显眼，给艺人更多方式以奖励的形式向粉丝提供周边。比如专属折扣、专属设计或者提前购买权，因为你是 Spotify 上的忠实听众，真正考虑如何感谢和奖励你在 Spotify 上的收听和粉丝行为。\n\n(00:06:28):\n然后我们还在关注的其他东西是听歌派对。过去一年我们举办了几次。我想我实际上在一年前的 Spotify 活动上谈到过这个。抱歉，不是几年前，是去年。\n\n(00:06:45):\n但听歌派对是另一种方式，然后我们还有一些正在探索的新想法。\n\nLenny (00:06:50):\n我听说有人用这个播客做听播派对，我希望你们也把这个功能推广到播客上，因为那会非常酷。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:06:58):\n是的。我们有各种各样的想法，关于如何把人们聚集在一起并实现变现，真的很有趣。\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\n好的。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:08):\n总有一天会实现的。\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\n神秘但令人兴奋。\n\n(00:07:11):\n说到 Taylor Swift，前几天我在看 TikTok，他们展示了一个人在演唱会内部拍摄整场演唱会的视频，然后镜头转向停车场，那里有数万人就站在停车场听从体育场传出的二手音乐。我想知道这种情况能不能变现，有没有机会？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:34):\n是的。我想他们通常会在那些停车场里放周边货车，这是一种方式——\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\n可能是非官方周边。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:40):\n对。\n\nLenny (00:07:40):\n所以你和艺人合作，我实际上想问这个问题。与音乐艺人合作最好的部分是什么，最糟糕的部分又是什么？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:07:48):\n我认为最好的部分是与那些真正投入到创造力和热情中的人一起工作，他们如此投入以至于以此为生。我想我们很多人都有创造性的追求、热情和喜欢做的事情，如果我们赚了数百万美元可以退休，你会全职做什么？通常就是这些追求之一。但我认为这需要一定的勇气，更不用说才华了，你真的必须冒险一试。\n\n(00:08:18):\n所以这种特质存在于这群人身上，和他们在一起很有趣，感受那种影响，然后想，\"哦，也许有一天我可以冒险一试，我不知道，去做我的书法或者学习尤克里里，然后全职做这个。\"但这是最好的部分。\n\n(00:08:35):\n我真的...我在一个音乐家庭长大。我爸爸是鼓手，虽然我们小时候他的笑话是真正的音乐家都有日常工作，因为他实际上必须有一份有福利的工作来养家，不能只是全职演出。\n\n(00:08:55):\n这实际上引出了你问题的另一面，最困难的部分是什么。\n\n我确实觉得我们在 Patreon 看到了很多这样的情况，我认为你尤其能在音乐人和艺术家身上看到这一点，他们有这样一种感觉：你想把自己创作的一切都给粉丝，而且你想免费提供，因为你太陶醉于这样一个想法——人们真的爱你，想要支持你，他们真的对你的创造力和你制作的一切都有回应，所以你不想向他们收费。但随之而来的问题是，那你要怎么谋生呢。\n\n(00:09:29):\n在某种程度上，创作者要靠艺术为生，就必须要有价值交换。\n\n(00:09:37):\n我发现这一点在音乐人身上表现得更加明显，这种\"穷困潦倒的艺术家\"精神让我现在做的事情变得相当困难，因为我们得到的很多反馈都是：\"哦，太棒了。我想办一个试听派对，所有东西都免费，让大家都来参加，什么都不卖。\" 而我们真正看待这件事的角度是，粉丝想要支持他们喜爱的艺术家，他们愿意打开钱包。\n\n(00:10:04):\n从 Substack 和 Patreon 的情况你就能看出，人们其实真的很乐意成为艺术的赞助人，他们把这视为一种荣誉徽章。\n\n(00:10:12):\n但我觉得音乐人尤其倾向于回避这一点,这让我正在做的这类事情变得更加困难。\n\nLenny (00:10:20):\n这是个很好的过渡,正好引到我想花时间讨论的一个领域——创作者经济、创作者、艺术家之类的话题。沿着这个思路,我想我也有这个问题。我觉得向人们收费很不好意思,但同时……我不认为我的东西值得收费,为什么会有人愿意为此付钱呢,所以我想你也会看到这种情况。就像,\"没人会为这个付钱的,这太疯狂了。\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:10:40):\n是啊。有趣的是,我们生活在一个非常资本主义、由市场决定价格的社会,但在个人层面,特别是当所谓的商品是艺术时,其中涉及太多情感和感受,创作者很难将自己与作品分离开来,去看市场能承受什么价格。\n\n(00:11:05):\n这也是为什么我认为有平台介入其实很好,它们说:\"嘿,我们看到了机会。让我们介入中间,让我们进行整合,让我们来做定价、支付、税务和财务这些困难的工作,真正创造价值——而这些对于一个创作者个人来说真的很难完成所有这些工作并促成这种连接。\" 这几乎是完美的市场解决方案。\n\n(00:11:38):\n但同样,这很难,因为在某些情况下,供应方实际上并不想赚钱,或者回避优化或赚钱。\n\n(00:11:47):\n然后还有创作过程。有时候,你处于心流状态,产出很多,而其他时候,你处于枯竭期,这些都是起伏不定的,这就是为什么我认为像 Patreon 和 Substack 这样的公司真的很酷,因为它们试图做的是平滑收入,让艺术家能够实际拥有可预测的……它们甚至不只是艺术家,创作者可以有可预测的、可持续的收入,这样他们就不会在不同工作之间跳来跳去,不会因为担心账单而失去迸发创造力的能力。\n\nLenny (00:12:22):\n我自己在 Substack 上也有这样的经历,Substack 是一个订阅制新闻通讯平台,这种生活方式的一个大缺点——人们不太会想到的是,一旦你开始收费,人们开始购买,比如说年度订阅,这意味着我至少要再做一年,而实际上,我从来都不想真正停下来,因为收入就会停止,那会非常难过。所以你就上了这个跑步机,你真的没有退出路径。我不确定这一切最终会走向何方,但到目前为止很棒。但这是人们不太会想到的事情——这种永无止境的、不断创作、不断创作的生活。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:12:52):\n我们内部称之为内容创作的仓鼠轮。你因为热爱而上去,然后你怎么下来呢。\n\n(00:12:59):\n所以这实际上又是一个有趣的挑战,让平台去思考它们可以在哪里增加价值,有没有办法让内容创作过程变得更容易——我不想说减轻负担,因为这不是负担,但有时候,如果你没有时间,或者你正处于人生中无法做到的阶段,有没有可以提供的服务或东西,有没有适合创作者的融资方案,而银行或传统机构不会提供,仅仅因为所产出的工作类型不同。\n\n(00:13:34):\n或者另一个潜在的解决方案是,平台能否创建内容。也许是自动化的,这样创作者可以休息一下。所以也许不一定是 AI,也许只是聚合数据或做摘要,或者也许还有其他未被探索的想法。但这是一个真实存在的问题。\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\n所以我有这个 lennybot.com 网站,这是一个基于我所有内容(包括播客节目)的 AI 聊天机器人,实际上,一位听这个播客的工程师主动联系我,提出帮我构建它,他做到了,而且很棒。我很好奇这会不会成为我的退休计划,因为机器人最终只是做这个,学到足够多。我非常怀疑,但尝试一下很有趣。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:14:18):\n是啊。用你自己的内容作为你的大语言模型,对吧?\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\n没错。就是这样。我很好奇这会发展到哪里。\n\n(00:14:26):\n我想继续聊聊创作者经济这个话题。感觉曾经有一股巨大的浪潮——创作者经济是未来的工作方式,所有这些平台推出来让创作者赚钱。但感觉在过去几年里,这股热潮似乎消退了。基本上只有极少数平台,YouTube、Spotify、Instagram、TikTok、Patreon,也许还有 Substack,而且当时还有一种感觉,未来的工作是自由职业,每个人都将为自己工作,创作内容,但感觉人们仍在做常规工作。很多这些创业公司表现并不好。\n\n(00:15:01):\n所以我想知道,从平台涌现的角度以及从创作者的角度,你认为未来五到十年会发生什么?你认为事情会保持不变吗?你认为会有另一波浪潮吗?你认为会走向何方?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:15:14):\n我认为平台会获胜在某种程度上是可以预测的,因为聚合的本质。一旦你拥有所有的供应,或者你聚合了需求,这就是非常强的网络效应。这就是为什么投资者喜欢投资这类业务,很难突破。\n\n(00:15:37):\n我也不会低估一些大平台的战略能力。它们绝对在提前思考,构建功能,思考它们是否将其视为变现机会。这当然是一个很好的战略举措,确保创作者觉得他们所在的平台对他们最有意义,他们不会流失或离开或尝试太多其他地方。\n\n(00:16:04):\n所以我认为那股热潮和资金是为了弄清楚是否还有其他新平台的空间,是否有特定的垂直领域,也许有机会创建垂直细分的功能和工具。\n\n(00:16:19):\n实际上,我认为我们在 Twitch 上看到了巨大的创造,对吧?Twitch 以前不存在,现在它们是个巨头。\n\n(00:16:26):\n我认为 TikTok 是这个时代出现的另一个。也许它们当初不是作为创作者经济类型的创业公司定位的,但实际上……\n\n(00:16:35):\n你看到 Union Square 这里 Kai 的事情了吗,那个游戏主播?\n\nLenny (00:16:39):\n没有。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:16:39):\n我在纽约,上周发生了一场骚乱,因为一个 Twitch 主播宣布他将在 Union Square 赠送 PlayStation 和电脑设备,结果大约有一百万十几岁的男孩出现了。我没开玩笑。他们不得不封锁纽约市中心来清理这场演变成抗议、骚乱、暴动的——\n\nLenny (00:17:07):\n天哪。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:08):\n——青少年的聚集,他们都是为了这一个创作者而来的,而这个人可能现在听我说话的人都没听说过。\n\nLenny (00:17:15):\n是啊。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:17:17):\n所以我确实认为很多预测已经实现了。有大量的人通过在互联网上创作内容来赚钱和谋生。\n\n(00:17:28):\n也有研究问年轻人他们想做什么,长大后想成为什么,我们在 Patreon 引用过这些数据,超过 60% 的人想以创作内容为生。\n\n(00:17:42):\n所以我认为这些趋势不会消失。也许会是补充收入,也许会是你人生某个阶段做的事情。但我确实认为这个领域仍未被充分开发。我就是看不到一个……\n\n(00:17:58):\n我想到 Michelle Phan,对吧?她基本上就是一个迷你迪士尼,当你这样想的时候,她创造了 IP。你能用 IP 做什么?漫画书、电影、电视节目、毛绒玩具、周边。我们将看到多少百万的 Michelle 粉丝?\n\n(00:18:16):\n看看中国正在发生什么。有大量这样的创作者。\n\n(00:18:20):\n所以,无论 VC 是否已经赢了,或者创业公司是否成功,你不可能降低内容创作的成本,增加分发的规模,却看不到这个创作者经济的出现。\n\n但我认为也许仍然有机会让更多公司蓬勃发展和成长，当然也有机会让更多个人可能自己去做这件事，自己摸索出来，而不需要让太多大平台从他们的创作追求中抽成。\n\nLenny (00:18:58):\n你有看过 TikTok 或者 Instagram Reels 上的 NPC 趋势吗？就是人们假装自己是电子游戏里的 NPC（非玩家角色）？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:06):\n我没看过。\n\nLenny (00:19:07):\n好吧。这太疯狂了。人们就是假装自己是电脑角色，然后人们付给他们小礼物让他们做一些事情。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:15):\n哦。是那个吗……是的，我看过。[听不清 00:19:19] 冰淇淋，冰淇淋。\n\nLenny (00:19:22):\n对，就是那个。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:22):\n是的。我之前没意识到。\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\n你一天就能赚几万美元，就这样……所以这也是一种谋生方式。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:24):\n是啊。\n\nLenny (00:19:30):\n说到成为创作者这个话题，你在 Patreon 看到过很多创作者尝试这样做，在 Apple 的时候也看过，包括 iTunes，我想聊聊这个，现在在 Spotify，甚至在你自己的创业公司。我很好奇你看到的创作者生涯成功的关键是什么，尤其是那些对人们来说可能不那么明显的东西。如果人们想走这条路，他们需要做对哪些事情？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:19:54):\n我看到的其中一件事，我不知道人们是否意识到，就是内容创作的一致性和可预测性，这也是我们之前谈到的仓鼠轮这个概念的来源。\n\n(00:20:08):\n但确实有这么一回事，就是持续不断地产出高质量的作品，把它放出来让你的受众去消费、回应和反应，这会产生很大的作用。这几乎就像一万小时定律。你必须在某件事上投入一万小时才能真正掌握它。但我一次又一次地看到这一点。\n\n(00:20:30):\n我是在，让我想想，我多大来着？应该是2010年开始在 YouTube 工作的。我真的觉得那时候整个这件事才刚刚起步。我们过去会整理这些关于什么让创作者成功的手册，因为很多努力都是为了支持这个新兴经济。我记得即使在2010年那时候，直到今天，这仍然是最重要的建议之一。\n\n(00:20:57):\n另一个是合作。所以与其他优秀的创作者合作，分享受众，让彼此接触到那些受众，这也是我们在我的创业公司 Kit 试图采用的方法。我们实际上会为创作者举办活动，让他们聚在一起，促进见面和交叉传播，希望这能对他们的职业生涯有益。如果他们和在聚会上认识的人一起做 YouTube 视频，那对所有各方都很好。所以这是两件事。\n\n(00:21:32):\n然后我确实认为在这个充斥着所有这些内容的世界里，仍然需要有策展人的存在和空间。策展人作为创作者是一个很有趣的概念。但策展人几乎就像图书出版公司或唱片公司或广播电台所扮演的角色，对吧？\n\n(00:21:56):\n在某种程度上，拥有一个品牌，有你所代表的东西，有一种氛围或精神，那个人几乎是，不是贬义上的看门人，而是像，\"我 Camille 不可能消费所有这些内容。你，我信任你的品味。告诉我应该听什么。\" 所以我要说的第三件事是，找出那些你真正可以将你的内容与之关联的策展人，那些与你志同道合的人，拥有你认为会喜欢你内容的受众，然后试着与他们建立联系。\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\n是的。最后这一点非常……我一直都能看到这种情况。如果有我非常尊敬的人推荐了什么东西，我显然会高度重视那个推荐。这就像网红是如何自然而然地出现的，对吧？人们只是说，\"这是你应该看看的东西\"，然后，\"哦，让我们付钱给你分享一些东西，这样人们就会试用我们的产品。\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:22:48):\n这正是我创业公司 Kit 背后的确切概念。它完全是关于策展，找到那些擅长推荐装备的人，让他们策展那些装备，然后你可以关注你喜欢的策展人，谁想去亚马逊上看那些你从未听说过的人的评论呢。很多时候，如果是你姐夫是个很棒的骑行者，他们说，\"买这个\"，你就直接买了。你甚至不在乎评论怎么说，因为你信任那个人。\n\nLenny (00:23:14):\n这个创业公司后来怎么样了？你从那次经历中学到了什么？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:23:17):\n我在2015年开始做这个创业公司。我们设法筹集了一些资金，筹集了超过200万美元，这是一个巨大的成就，特别是如果你了解风险投资的话。他们在资助有色人种、女性、非顺性别白人男性方面的记录很糟糕，就是这个记录。\n\n(00:23:43):\n我们在几年时间里建立这家公司的经历非常棒，把一堆关键指标都提升到了正确的方向，然后我们到了一个要搞清楚下一步该怎么走的阶段，我们是否应该做过渡轮融资。我们当时在尝试筹集 A 轮。我认为我们在创作者经济趋势上有点早。大概一年半之后，我想，我希望筹集资金会是轻而易举的事。但无论如何，我们在与一堆不同的选择、不同的方案做斗争。\n\n(00:24:19):\n实际上我参加了一个叫 StartX 的创业加速器，它是斯坦福运营的，斯坦福是我的母校。我们学到了很多关于如何出售公司以及并购是什么样的。所以我们开始探索那条路。\n\n(00:24:34):\n最终，对我们来说最合理的是退出并与 Patreon 联手。所以这就是我们最终做的。2018年出售了公司，加入了 Patreon，在那里工作了几年，那也是我遇到 Adam 的地方。\n\nLenny (00:24:49):\n太棒了。我其实想问一下关于出售公司的经历。现在有很多听众正在考虑出售他们的公司，或者也许希望有一天能出售他们的公司，我认为这有现实情况，然后也有关于它可能如何进行的想法。我很好奇你从那次经历中得到了什么。我想具体问的是，对于那些考虑有一天出售公司的人，你能分享什么建议吗？你认为也许可以更早做什么，或者只是分享一下收购的现实情况？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:25:20):\n我认为对每个公司来说都是不同的。有些公司被吸引进去然后被收购。还有其他公司主动推销自己。\n\n(00:25:31):\n我们绝对属于后者，这意味着我们管理了一个流程。这类似于你如何管理融资流程。不是每家公司都只是见了 VC 就在第一次尝试时筹集到资金。他们会经历一个流程，见很多 VC，让他们通过漏斗，最终希望能成功完成一轮融资。所以我认为这是一个要点，如果这是你感兴趣的事情，就把它当作一个流程来对待和管理。对大多数公司来说，我会说它不会就这样发生。\n\n(00:26:04):\n然后我要给的第二条建议是，我认为我们应该从一开始就与潜在的收购方交谈，分享我们的愿景和我们试图完成的事情，因为我们在公司旅程中相当晚才开始这些，这只是意味着花了……当我遇到潜在的 CPO，会收购公司的人，会成为我老板或 CEO 的人，那是他们第一次见我，而如果那是他们第五次见我，我们就会建立起关系，他们会更了解愿景和我们试图做的事情，希望会有更多时间去思考它。\n\n(00:26:42):\n所以这就是我的两条建议。从创立公司的那一刻起就开始准备出售你的公司，这是件奇怪的事，因为显然，如果你在创办一家公司，对大多数创始人来说，他们希望它成为下一个大事件，他们不是为了出售它而创办它，但这是一个很好的事情要放在你的雷达上，因为你永远不知道未来会发生什么。然后第二是把它当作一个流程来对待。\n\nLenny (00:27:07):\n是的。关于认识可能收购你的人这一点，我发现这百分之一千是真的。我们把公司卖给了 Airbnb，这就是我如何到 Airbnb 的，我意识到的是，你只需要那些未来可能买你的人在他们遇到问题时脑海中有你，这样他们就可以想，\"哦，Camille 和她的团队可以为我们解决这个问题。让我们去和她聊聊，看看……\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:28):\n没错。\n\nLenny (00:27:28):\n\"……看看他们是否对收购感兴趣。\"\n\n(00:27:31):\n关于流程这一点，也是百分之一千共鸣。我们基本上……当我们开始与一家公司聊天时，我们就想，\"好吧，还有谁可能收购我们？让我们列一个大名单，以及我们可以尽快与那家公司的谁交谈，然后就探索。\" 但这更具挑战性，因为是你主动联系他们说，\"嘿，你想聊聊买我们公司的事吗\"，而不是他们联系你。所以正如你所说，如果他们联系你总是更好，但你不能总是控制这一点。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:27:54):\n对。或者如果会议根本不是在收购的背景下进行的，而是像，\"我们在做一些很酷的事情。我们有一个很棒的愿景。它与你正在做的事情相一致。\n\n也许这里有合作机会，\"而不是直接告诉你我们在做什么，然后当我在12个月后联系你收购我时，你之前至少听说过我。\n\nLenny (00:28:12):\n我发现即使你开始谈论收购，你也永远不想直接说，\"嘿，你想收购我们吗？\"而是说，\"嘿，你想建立某种战略合作伙伴关系吗？你想探讨合作吗？\"特别有意思。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:28:23):\n就像谈恋爱一样。\n\nLenny (00:28:24):\n对对对。有时候你就是不能太直接。\n\n(00:28:28):\n所以当你到 Patreon 的时候，我不知道是立即还是最终你负责了市场的创作者端，我发现看你的背景，你基本上在职业生涯中大部分时间都待在市场的供给侧。\n\n(00:28:43):\n我其实也是一样。我在 Airbnb 的工作，尤其是或者说主要是在房东端。\n\n(00:28:48):\n我认为需要特定的思维方式和性格才会对市场的这一端感兴趣，而不是消费者端——那是每个人通常都想去的地方，也就是客户端。所以我很好奇是什么吸引你在所有工作过的地方都选择业务的这一端，以及你发现在这个角色和这一端取得成功的重要因素是什么?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:29:09):\n吸引我到业务这一端的原因可能一开始是偶然的。同样，来自音乐家庭和背景，我一直对帮助艺术家谋生有天然的兴趣。所以我觉得这种兴趣是存在的。\n\n(00:29:29):\n在 Apple，我做了……那里只有两个 PM。我们什么都做。\n\n(00:29:34):\n在 YouTube，我意外地进入了创作者领域。\n\n(00:29:39):\n但我开始深入理解市场动态的地方，实际上是我的经历和我做过的一份不在创作者或艺术或这些大型消费者平台或创作者经济领域的工作，那是一家叫 Hailo 的创业公司，总部在伦敦，当时是网约车和叫车领域 Uber 和 Lyft 的巨大竞争对手，我在供给侧工作，确保有足够的车辆来满足需求。\n\n(00:30:17):\n在那样一个市场中，人们实时地试图叫车从上城去下城，如果你没有供应商，如果你的供应商不满意，如果他们罢工，如果有法规意味着你不能使用你的服务，你会亲身体验到对业务的影响。我认为在那里我……\n\n(00:30:44):\n我参与并推出的项目之一是美国的 Uber 竞品，因为 Hailo 在欧洲主要是叫出租车，不涉及在纽约被称为 livery 的私人专车。基本上就是你的叔叔或阿姨或表亲可以打开 Lyft 去接任何人。这在欧洲根本不存在。\n\n(00:31:09):\n所以我们必须弄清楚如何在美国推出这个服务，如何吸引司机，如何创建这个供给，就像无论用户体验多好，营销多棒，你能产生多少需求，如果有人打开那个应用，没有可用的车，那都没用。\n\n(00:31:31):\n所以很多人把市场说成是鸡和蛋的问题。我实际上认为它们是双边的，你从供给开始，归根结底，你可以为需求端优化或选择在有冲突时你要优先考虑哪一方。\n\n(00:31:53):\n是的，没有任何一方你都不会成功，但我亲身经历和体验了这样的痛苦:建立了这个很棒的后台操作系统，连接到这个优秀的用户界面，然后你打开应用却叫不到车，因为没有足够的可用车辆。\n\n(00:32:12):\n所以我认为这巩固了我的感觉，对于市场来说，你不能忽视为供给侧解决真正的痛点和需求，以确保整个业务能够运转。\n\nLenny (00:32:26):\n我对市场做了大量研究，基本上发现了同样的事情，供给几乎总是你需要集中几乎所有时间的地方，尤其是在开始阶段。\n\n(00:32:34):\n我的理解方式是，如果你有一家商店，货架上就是你的商品，如果货架上什么都没有，你就不会有生意。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:32:41):\n完全正确。\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\n有少数罕见的案例，我记不清具体是哪些了，需求实际上是更大的挑战，而供给真的很容易。\n\n(00:32:47):\n你知道吗?是 Rover。Rover 在供给方面完全没问题，因为事实证明谁不想通过看几个小时的狗赚50美元呢。这是一个非常容易推销的事情，很多人可以做也愿意做，所以他们实际上发现供给不是问题。\n\n(00:33:01):\n但在大多数情况下，正如你所说，10次中有9次供给是人们寻找的。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:05):\n完全同意。\n\n(00:33:06):\n我发现我经常听到的反例是 eBay，他们在聚合需求方面做得如此之好，基本上能够强迫供应商接受他们喜欢的条款。但我无法想象……和一些 eBay 早期的人聊聊会很有意思，整个事情不是在他们出去弄清楚我们需要让哪些关键供应商加入这个平台才能开始聚合需求的情况下启动的。\n\nLenny (00:33:32):\n是的。你得在 eBay 上有一些好东西。我想知道是不是豆豆娃(Beanie Babies)或者他们最初是什么。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:33:37):\n对，没错。\n\nLenny (00:33:39):\n本期节目由 Vanta 赞助，帮助你简化安全合规以加速增长。成千上万的快速增长公司如 Gusto、Comm、Quora 和 Modern Treasury 信任 Vanta

iTunes 当年的第二个 PM,我很好奇你从在 Apple 工作的经历中学到了什么。我想我在某处读到你可能与 Steve Jobs 和 Jony Ive 密切合作过,但我不知道是否属实,但我很好奇……不是吗?好吧,但你有一个 Steve Jobs 的故事?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:34:57):\n有的。\n\nLenny (00:34:58):\n好的。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:35:00):\n是的。所以我在 iTunes 早期,我研究生毕业后开始在那里实习,我的实习实际上是在唱片公司关系部门,然后我开始全职做产品营销工作。\n\n(00:35:17):\n在当时的 Apple,我想即使到今天,他们没有产品经理的头衔,他们有产品营销经理。所以我的一位同事,至今仍是好朋友,Steve——也叫 Steve,不是 Steve Jobs——是第一个从事 iTunes 工作的 PMM,他主要做所有客户端的东西。他推出了商店和一切。但我想我是 iTunes 团队中拥有这个头衔的第二个人。所以那真的很酷。\n\n(00:35:44):\n至于 Steve Jobs 的故事,我想我跟你提过人们喜欢听这个故事,其实什么都没发生,我只是走到他面前说了声\"嗨\",我会讲这个故事。\n\n(00:35:53):\n但我认为人们觉得有趣的背景是因为关于 Steve 的其他故事。让我先给一点背景。\n\n(00:36:01):\n那个 Steve Jobs 的传说是,如果你和他在电梯里,你最好准备好谈论你在公司做什么,因为他有一个习惯,进电梯看着你说,\"你做什么?你在这里做什么?\"还有传言说,有些人没有给他一个好答案,结果那天成了他们在 Apple 的最后一天。\n\n(00:36:24):\n所以有一个人我不认识,但在我到之前在我的部门工作过,他进了电梯抬头看到 Steve 正在靠近他。所以他去按开门按钮,却不小心按了关门按钮,然后就这样疯狂地按……如果你在听播客你看不到我,但是疯狂地按按钮,试图开门,但不小心按了关门按钮,电梯去了它的目的地。显然他下电梯后直接冲了出去,跑下了走廊。\n\nLenny (00:37:02):\n他永远不会记得我的脸。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:03):\n对,没错。\n\nLenny (00:37:04):\n我消失了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:04):\n这就是背景。\n\n(00:37:07):\n所以在2005年,我在 Apple 实习的第一天,我遇到了这样的情况:我参加了毕业典礼,因为我只剩一个学期要回去上,所以我决定参加毕业典礼。那基本上是前一周发生的。对于那些了解工作时间跨度的人来说,这是他在斯坦福大学毕业典礼上发表那个非常鼓舞人心和著名的演讲的时候,那是一个非常棒、非常棒的演讲。\n\nLenny (00:37:41):\n你在那场演讲现场?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:42):\n我在那里,是的。\n\nLenny (00:37:42):\n哇。\n\n大家都很喜欢那个演讲。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:47):\n确实是一场很棒的演讲。真的很——\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\n你当时在现场听的时候是什么感受?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:37:51):\n完全被鼓舞了。\n\n(00:37:54):\nApple 当时还不像今天这样,在品牌影响力方面,它现在已经达到了巅峰。真的是走了很长的路。当时我在一个会议上遇到招聘人员时,我还想:\"Apple?他们是做什么的来着?我室友有台 Mac,但 iTunes 是什么?哦,对,我好像听说过。我觉得...\"\n\n(00:38:19):\n后来那些跳舞的 iPod 剪影广告真正让 Apple 火遍全球。那些广告当时还没真正推出,但已经开始了,对吧?开始逐渐发酵,你听到越来越多关于它的消息,与音乐的关联让 Apple 变得更酷了。\n\n(00:38:35):\n但那个演讲...说到毕业演讲,那绝对是顶级的。\n\n(00:38:41):\nSteve 很擅长这个。他是个非凡的讲故事者。\n\n(00:38:44):\n所以毕业典礼是周六,周日我回家。周一我就开始实习了,然后我们就在 Cafe Max 和新同事们在一起,Steve 就坐在我旁边的桌子。所以我就想:\"天哪,Steve 就在那儿。我真想去打个招呼,介绍一下自己,还有桌上的每个人。\"\n\n(00:39:09):\n要知道,当时我还没听说过那个关于电梯按钮的完整故事,因为这是我第一天,但他们都在互相看着对方。他们说:\"是啊,如果你想的话可以去跟他打招呼,但你只是个实习生。\"他们说:\"希望他不会在你第一天就把你开除。\"\n\n(00:39:22):\n但我一直以来,在我的家庭和生活中,都被鼓励在见到别人时主动打招呼,让他们知道你欣赏他们所做的事,并感谢他们,因为这种事不常发生。\n\n(00:39:39):\n很多时候,人们会去要照片或签名,但这种主动介绍自己、打招呼,并因为某人做的某件影响了你的事而感谢他们的想法,是我父母一直鼓励我在这个世界上应有的行为方式,也是我看到他们这样做并以此为榜样的。可能还是因为我爸是音乐家,是其他音乐家的粉丝,在音乐圈里有这样一种文化,艺术家们会互相交流某个创作如何影响了你等等。\n\n(00:40:09):\n所以我走向他,从我的午餐桌站起来走过去,我说:\"您好,我叫 Camille。我这个夏天在这里实习。今天是我第一天。我周六在 Stanford 参加了毕业典礼,您的演讲太精彩了。我真的很受鼓舞。我很高兴能来这里,很兴奋能在这家公司工作,我只是想感谢您周六花时间为我们做那个演讲。\"\n\n(00:40:38):\n然后他就说:\"你是谁?什么?你是实习生?那你在这儿做什么?\"有点...我们有了一点交流。我不得不解释说:\"是的,我毕业了,但我在实习,我还有一个学期。\"然后他说:\"哦,好的。那欢迎来到 Apple,祝你好运,希望你这个夏天有个很棒的经历。\"就这样。我没被开除,而且我跟 Steve 打了招呼。\n\n(00:41:01):\n在那之后,我感觉像是认识他了。每次在园区看到他,我都会挥手打招呼,我觉得他根本不知道我是谁,但他会困惑地看着我,然后挥手回应。\n\nLenny (00:41:12):\n\"她好友好啊。这人是谁?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:14):\n是的。\n\nLenny (00:41:15):\n你还记得如果他问你,你会怎么描述你的工作吗?我感觉这可能深深印在你脑海里,但如果不记得了,那就算了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:21):\n哦,我的说辞,如果他问我在哪里[听不清 00:41:23]。\n\nLenny (00:41:23):\n对,没错。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:41:24):\n嗯,是的,我很幸运,因为我做的其中一件事他会确切知道是什么,就是每当有 iTunes 发布时,我会管理新闻室。这真的是很基础的工作。\n\n(00:41:38):\n但当有新的 iTunes 6 发布或什么的新闻活动时,他们会为 Walter Isaacson 或者,我不知道 Kara Swisher 那时候是否在工作,但不管是哪个记者,Steve 会有一个房间,里面有一台 iMac 电脑,上面有个装满曲目的 iTunes 资料库。会有最新的 iPod 同步到那台电脑和所有曲目。每次采访后,所有东西都必须重置。\n\n(00:42:10):\n而且,这个资料库是精心制作的,所以他会在内容上给出反馈,持续好几个月,因为他会做演示。所以他想确保:\"确保我所有最喜欢的曲目都在里面,我最喜欢的 Beatles 唱片,我最喜欢的 Bob Dylan 唱片,这个艺术家是谁?让我看看。好吧,他们达不到标准。哦,这首歌是什么?哦,我喜欢这首歌。哦,加上这个。\"所以他非常参与整个演示的过程,需要有人去做所有这些事。\n\n(00:42:38):\n那还有谁比刚从 Stanford 工程硕士毕业的学生更适合去做所有制作资料库的基础工作呢?但这些就是他关注的细节。所以我会直接告诉他我做产品营销,我的主要职责之一就是为他准备新闻室,他会说:\"哦,好的。\"\n\nLenny (00:43:01):\n你提到你的头衔是产品营销经理,最近 Twitter 上有个热议,Brian Chesky 在 Airbnb 分享说他们把产品经理的角色转变为基本上是 Apple 的模式。我很好奇你对这种产品方法的看法,Apple 的方式与传统的产品经理?\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:21):\n从我看到的,他们是非常有意地这样做的。我知道他们实际上从 Apple 聘请了 Hiroki——\n\nLenny (00:43:29):\n是的。很多 Apple 的人。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:43:31):\n是的。实际上他们聘请的其中一位新领导,我不知道你是否认识 Judson Coplan,我的好朋友,我们那个夏天在 Apple 一起实习,他在那里工作了15年才去 Airbnb。\n\n(00:43:45):\n但是,Apple 的架构,更多是设计和工程主导的组织,我会说更像是工匠而不是战略家。这是我从 Apple 转到 Google 时看到的一个明显区别。Google 有更多来自 Coca-Cola、McKinsey 和 Bain 的人。我觉得 Apple 根本不存在这些人。\n\n(00:44:15):\n更像是:\"让我们用三维棋的方式来规划下一步。\"而在 Apple 是:\"让我们钻研、让我们打磨、让我们构建、让我们看什么感觉对。\"这是不同的方法。因此,产品管理的方法也大不相同。\n\n(00:44:33):\n所以我觉得这很合理。Brian Chesky 的背景是设计师,所以 Apple 的方式可能更能引起他的共鸣。\n\n(00:44:41):\n然后就个人层面的产品经理而言,Apple 当时没有产品经理,最接近的是 CPM,技术项目经理,帮助管理冲刺和管理进度,列出会有哪些功能。\n\n(00:44:59):\n我花了很多时间和极具才华的设计团队在一起,如果我有产品功能的想法或...我们会提前几个月思考,比如 iTunes 10 发布的主要故事是什么,或者三个关键信息是什么,我们可能会有新功能的想法。\n\n(00:45:19):\n但因为我们有那个时间节点,我们提前就知道要规划什么,你在处理消息传递和消费者定位时,是在任何东西真正上线或构建之前。这就框定了你想要构建什么功能,以及你会提出什么问题来解决,而不是像产品管理演变成的另一种方式那样,有一个明确的指标要推动。\n\nLenny (00:45:52):\n这就是大多数公司的运作方式。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:45:52):\n嗯嗯。\n\nLenny (00:45:54):\n我想回到创作者经济的话题。我感觉你在创作者经济领域工作的时间比大多数人都长,所以我想用我们的时间在那里多花一点时间。平台方面呢?如果有人考虑创办一家公司来服务创作者,为创作者建立一个新平台,也许让创作者谋生,你有什么建议吗?你认为哪里可能有机会?哪里你会觉得:\"不,你可能不想在这里花时间?\"\n\nCamille Hearst (00:46:24):\n我认为对于任何公司来说,解决一个真实的问题是最重要的。所以创作者有很多挑战和可以解决的问题。一些痛点比其他的更强烈。\n\n(00:46:40):\n我认为从根本上说,每个创作者需要两件事。他们需要增长受众,他们需要获得报酬,这样他们才能谋生。在某种程度上,我确实认为增长受众更重要,因为有了受众,就会以各种方式打开变现的机会。\n\n(00:46:59):\n但还有各种其他的事情,比如我们谈到的融资、医疗保险,等等,我们作为人类面临的问题,试图在世界上做自由职业者,通常同样适用于以创意为生的人。\n\n(00:47:14):\n然后还有创作者领域独特的东西,比如能量的爆发、创意流的爆发,这可能不适用于有薪工作或按小时计薪的工作。\n\n(00:47:28):\n所以仍然有很多问题等待为创作者解决。我不认为这个领域已经解决了,完成了,可以收工了。\n\n所以我的建议是，去看看现实中存在的问题，选一个真实的问题，然后全力以赴。\n\nLenny (00:47:47):\n明智的建议。\n\n(00:47:49):\n你看过这个播客主持人 Bobbi 吗？我忘了她的姓，她的播客只做了几期就火箭般蹿升到全美第四大播客，她采访了 Drake 和几位喜剧演员。你见过这个人吗？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:05):\n我觉得我应该知道，但就像我们开头说的，我是个超级音乐迷，我不听任何播客。\n\nLenny (00:48:11):\n我想到她是因为我看了她在一个访谈节目上的片段，虽然她现在拥有全美最火的播客，但她还没从中赚到任何钱。我们会在节目说明中放上她的链接，但她真的太搞笑了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:25):\n太棒了。\n\nLenny (00:48:25):\n她身上有种特质，看她的节目特别有意思。但好吧，你现在还不听播客。我们会让你上播客的。你现在就在播客上。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:32):\n我现在就在播客上。\n\nLenny (00:48:34):\n对啊。\n\n(00:48:36):\n你提到了你的父母，我在读你的维基百科页面时，上面对你父母的描述是\"激进的佛教徒艺术家技术专家\"。我很好奇这是什么意思，还有就是你成长过程中有没有什么记忆或时刻能体现他们的这一面？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\n有趣的是，在你发给我之前，我都不知道我有维基百科页面。\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\n什么？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\n我不知道它是从哪来的。\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\n天哪，谁创建的？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:48:56):\n就是啊。\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\n太神奇了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:08):\n就像，\"什么？我上维基百科了？\"所以挺好笑的。\n\nLenny (00:49:08):\n太疯狂了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:49:13):\n是啊。\n\n(00:49:13):\n让我想想。我在八十年代和九十年代在旧金山长大。我父母在七十年代在东海岸开始信佛。我爸爸，我提到过他是鼓手和音乐家，他还有一个工作室。我们楼梯下有个壁橱，他把它改造成了一个制作工作室，他是个艺术家。\n\n(00:49:43):\n他为市政府工作。我妈妈也为市政府工作，成长过程中我们没什么钱，所以很多电脑设备都是从街上捡来的。他会找到……有人把 PC 扔出来……他在游戏玩家开始组装 PC 之前就在组装了。我记得他会带着盒子、电路板和芯片回家，然后真的去图书馆或商店买本书，研究怎么组装这些电脑，坏掉的键盘，他也会修好。他应该当个机械工程师的，在这方面超级有天赋。\n\n(00:50:15):\n基本上他有整套制作工作室，配有鼓机和所有设备。我是他的小助手。所以我会帮他焊接东西，修修补补，实际上一起组装这些电脑。所以大概是这样……我不知道那段引用是从哪来的。我得去点开链接看看参考来源是什么，但这就是一些背景。\n\n(00:50:42):\n还有一件事是，在八十年代和九十年代的旧金山，我们过去常在家里举办佛教聚会，那时候有很多所谓的街头传教，比如 Hare Krishna 的人会在 Haight Street 上来来往往，就在我家附近。\n\n(00:51:01):\nNation of Islam，我哥哥有一段时间加入了他们，会在街角卖 Final Call 报纸和豆饼兄弟。\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\n是的。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:51:10):\nFinal Call 是当时 Nation of Islam 的报纸。\n\n(00:51:15):\n所以那是一个完全不同的时代，跟现在完全不一样，我们信奉日莲佛教，有印着\"南无妙法莲华经\"的小册子，我会站在家门口的台阶上……我们有个栅栏门。所以我会站在门后面，大概七八岁的样子，就问路过的人，\"嘿，如果你对南无妙法莲华经感兴趣，这里有小册子。了解更多。我们家里有聚会。\"\n\n(00:51:40):\n我现在跟我妈妈一起笑这件事。她说，\"真不敢相信我们当时在做这个。\"现在看来完全疯了，但在当时，那就是，再说一次，七十年代刚过去，是一个非常不同的时代。\n\n(00:51:49):\n如果你看过《与爱何干》，Tina Turner 可能……她最近刚去世，可能是最著名、最知名的日莲佛教信徒之一，她实际上也是在同样的时代开始信佛的，七十年代和八十年代……或者可能是七十年代。\n\n(00:52:05):\n所以这就是那段话的意思。这些是能说明那个时刻的几段回忆。但你可以看到，音乐、技术、帮助创作者获得报酬，这些确实影响了我今天的一切。\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\n基于这些故事，这是对你父母的完美描述。而且感觉你做现在的事情是必然的。产品、技术、音乐、艺术家、创作者。太棒了。\n\n(00:52:33):\n在我们进入非常激动人心的快问快答环节之前，我要再问一个问题，这个问题是关于框架的。有没有一个你常用的、或者经常分享的、你认为对听众可能有用的关于产品开发或团队建设的最喜欢的框架、流程、系统或方法？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:52:51):\n我在 Hailo 的经历中有一位很棒的经理，他让我认识了 Marty Cagan，后来我跟他成了朋友，从他那学到了很多。我特别喜欢他的方式——\n\nLenny (00:52:51):\n真的吗？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:53:03):\n是的，他很棒。实际上，我应该问问他关于 eBay 早期的事情，因为我觉得他可能是让 eBay 起步的人之一。\n\n(00:53:12):\n但我学到的、我们在那段时间真正强调的一件事是双轨敏捷的理念，即同时进行探索和交付，而且是以非瀑布式的方式。\n\n(00:53:29):\n不是说，\"好吧，设计师们去那边琢磨几个月，等我们想清楚了，再把它扔给程序员，然后祈祷一切顺利。\"而是有一个持续的循环，本质上是去风险化你的假设，并能够快速做到这一点，这样你就可以通过不断找出你思维中的错误，或者那些你没预料到会发生的事情，来规划通往新路径和创新的道路。\n\n(00:54:04):\n所以我想每个人都知道影响力-努力或风险-回报的二维矩阵，可以在那个矩阵上标出不同的机会和你可能做的事情。\n\n(00:54:16):\n但我从这种工作方式中最喜欢的收获之一——围绕双轨敏捷、首先去风险化最高风险想法的方法——是一个概念，就是把那些最大胆的想法，在产品探索方面优先处理，想想你能做什么来开始去风险化，因为如果你总是把那些推迟，而倾向于低风险或更可预测的小动作，你怎么可能真正创新并达到下一个层次。\n\n(00:54:53):\n这是一个不太安全的选择。所以作为领导者，你要坐在这个位置上，你可以承担责任。所以如果这些事情中有些没成功，责任在你而不在你的团队，给你的团队失败和尝试的权利，去风险化那些风险假设，让它们变成低风险、可预测的，然后你就可以把它们放进交付栏目去执行。\n\nLenny (00:55:18):\n这让我想起一条建议，人们称之为\"吃青蛙\"，就是早上第一件事吃青蛙，本质上就是先做最难的事，然后一天就会变得更轻松。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:30):\n是的。\n\nLenny (00:55:30):\n我不知道为什么是吃青蛙，我不知道这个说法从哪来的。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:34):\n我也不知道。我喜欢\"画猫头鹰\"。那是我最喜欢的 Twilio 价值观之一。\n\nLenny (00:55:39):\n详细说说。我想听更多。那是什么？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:55:44):\n公司有他们的价值观。其中一个是\"画猫头鹰\"。实际上是\"画他妈的猫头鹰\"，那个梗是\"怎么画猫头鹰\"，你画几个圆圈，然后你就画个该死的猫头鹰。所以就是直接去做。到了某个点，你就得搞清楚怎么做。\n\n(00:56:10):\n抱歉我说脏话，但说出这个价值观的真实版本会更有趣，就是有时候你得直接上。你不会知道确切的路径，也许你不会去掉所有风险，但你从几个圆圈开始，然后把它做出来。\n\nLenny (00:56:27):\n我喜欢。这个播客上说脏话是很常见的，所以我很高兴你说了。\n\n(00:56:32):\n说到这里，我们进入了非常激动人心的快问快答环节。准备好了吗？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:36):\n希望吧。我没准备这个。我想我会现场发挥。\n\nLenny (00:56:40):\n很好。完美。\n\n(00:56:41):\n你最常向别人推荐的两三本书是什么？\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:46):\n《三体》、《时间的皱纹》，还有 Octavia Butler 的《血童》。\n\nLenny (00:56:53):\n《三体》最近被提到了好几次，实际上根据这本书改编的剧集要出来了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:56:58):\n我很期待。是的。\n\nLenny (00:56:59):\n我太兴奋了。我一直在看《基地》，这是另一部我很期待的剧集，但就是，我不知道发生了什么。太复杂了。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:07):\n怎么样？我一直在等……\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\n呃。\n\nCamille Hearst (00:57:08):\n我是个超级科幻迷。",
