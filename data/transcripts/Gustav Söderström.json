  "en": "Gustav Söderström (00:00:00):\nThe internet started with curation, often user curation. So you took something, some good like people or books or music, and you digitize it and you put it online and then you ask users to curate it. And that was your Facebook, Spotify, and so forth. And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well. And I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products. We have to rethink the user interface and the experience for recommendation first era. And so what does that mean in the generative era? No one really knows yet.\n\nLenny (00:00:47):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Gustav Söderström. Gustav is a product legend and he's now the co-president, chief product and chief technology officer at Spotify, where he's responsible for Spotify's global product and technology strategy and oversees the product design data and engineering teams at the company. I've had Gustav on my wish list of dream guests to have on this podcast since the day I launched the podcast and I'm so happy we made it happen.\n\nLenny (00:01:19):\nIn our conversation, we dig into what Gustav has learned about taking big bets and what to do when they don't work out, how Spotify moved away from squads and how they structure their teams now, how AI is already impacting their product, and also the future of music generated by AI. Also, why all great products need to pull some magic trick, how accurately succession represents Swedish business culture, and his hilarious analogy of peeing in your pants. Enjoy this episode with Gustav Söderström after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:01:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by Microsoft Clarity, a free easy to use tool that captures how real people are actually using your site.

Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\n\nLenny (00:03:44):\nEppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at getE-P-P-O.com. That's geteppo.com. And 10X, your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:04:08):\nGustav, welcome to the podcast.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:04:11):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Pleasure to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:13):\nIt's my pleasure to have you on. So at this point, you've been at Spotify for over 14 years, which is a rare feat in the tech world, and you've held a lot of different roles while you've been at Spotify. Can you just start off by giving us a sense of what these various roles and what you've done over the years at Spotify and then just what are you up to these days? What are you responsible for now?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:04:33):\nSo I came into Spotify in early 2009, late 2008. And my job then, I had been an entrepreneur, started some of my own companies in the, back then, very, very early feature phone, smartphone space. So I had a bunch of knowledge there. I had sold the company to Yahoo in the mobile space. I worked there for a while. I came back to Sweden and then I met through a mutual friend, Daniel Ek, the CEO and co-founder of Spotify. And they had built the desktop product already, the free streaming desktop product, and it was amazing and I could try it, but they needed someone to figure out what to do with mobile. And because I had been an entrepreneur in that space, I got that job.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:05:20):\nSo my job was to head up mobile for Spotify and figure out what the mobile offering would be, which was a challenge because, obviously, Spotify desktop was a free on-demand streaming application and back then, specifically with edge networks, you couldn't really stream at all in real time. The performance wasn't there and also you couldn't fund that with an ads model. So it was a product and business model innovation that was a lot of fun. So that's how I started. Then after a few years, I took on all of product development for Spotify. And then a few years later, I actually took on the technology responsibility, the CTO role for Spotify as well. And recently, my official title is co-president of Spotify together with Alex Nordstrom. So we run half of the company each. I run the product and technology side and he runs for the business and content side. So that's the super fast version.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:06:20):\nAside from getting more responsibilities taking on the technology department, it has been the same job by title. I've always reported to Daniel, but because Spotify's grown so much every six to 12 months, it's been starting at a new company. First, it was sort of a Swedish Nordic challenge and then it was a European challenge and then it was getting into the US and then we became a public company. So it's as if I had jumped around between a lot of jobs actually, even though it was largely the same title and role.\n\nLenny (00:06:55):\nYour story makes me think of the classic be careful what you're good at because you end up taking on more and more. And clearly, you've been given more and more responsibility over the years and so clearly things are going well and you're doing well.\n\nLenny (00:07:08):\nShifting a little bit. So you're on my podcast currently. You actually have your own podcast, which was this limited series on the product story of Spotify, which I listened to and loved, and it's surreal to listen to your voice in real time because I've been listening to that recently in preparation for this conversation. Two questions, just what made you decide to launch your own podcast knowing you had a full-time job and a lot going on and the production value for your podcast was very high for what I could tell? And then two, just what did you learn from that experience in terms of the product you ended up a building and just empathizing with the podcast creator side of?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:07:41):\nThere were a bunch of different reasons why I did that. One is, and not a small one, I think, like you, I love writing and I have this secret creator dream in me. I used to write blog posts a long time ago and I write internally a lot. You can't write that much externally when you work at a company like this.\n\nLenny (00:08:01):\nYeah.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:08:02):\nBut I love writing and talking and presenting. So there was certainly that. And then no small part was, from a product point of view, to empathize with one of our main constituents, the podcast creator. I'm, unfortunately, not a great musician. I try to play instruments and so forth, but I don't have any records. I don't sing very well. But I decided to make a podcast and that taught me a huge amount about what it's like to be a creator, creating different styles of podcast.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:08:33):\nFor example, we wanted to do a higher production cost podcast with music and then right away you run into a bunch of problems as Spotify is actually pretty well positioned to solve, but still, it's really hard to have music in a podcast from a rights perspective. So you understand all these problems that podcasters have and you can be better at solving them. But the biggest benefit and the real reason for doing the public podcast was that I have actually done an internal podcast through a hack where we could gate the podcast-only employees. And I tried to figure out internally how to build more culture around Spotify and help define for new employees and existing employees, who we are, the mistakes we did, the successes we had, and how we think about strategy specifically in product strategy because we were quite well known externally for technology and the squads and all of these things, not so much for product strategy.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:09:36):\nAnd because I love storytelling more than Google Docs, I decided to do an internal podcast and I went around and I interviewed actually Daniel's direct reports. So the CMO, the CHRO and CFO. And just ask them about a bunch of stuff. And the idea was to make them more approachable for employees because I felt listening to podcasts, even these people that have no idea who I am because I've never met them, I feel like I know them, I feel like I know how they think and I just like them much more. So the secret idea was, what if you could get to know your leaders much better than you do through occasional meetings or some town hall? So I did that internally, and because I'm a product person, we ended up talking a lot about product and product strategy. And people internally really like that.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:10:26):\nSo next time, the question was, what if people that don't even work at Spotify yet could feel as if they knew people at Spotify? That'd be great because most leaders in most companies are very opaque and appear as some otherworldly creatures that aren't really real, I think, when you see them in business papers or something. So what if you have heard them talk for an hour or so? So that was general idea. So a combination of recruitment tool, sharing more about how we think about product strategy and just because I think it was a lot of fun. I got to interview a bunch of smart and interesting people both externally and internally.\n\nLenny (00:11:09):\nDid it have the effect that you were hoping after looking back?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:11:12):\nI think it did. The podcast did well and, no, we did not give it our own promotion. I had to compete as everyone else, which also gives you a lot of empathy for the problem of like, okay, now you have a product, what about user acquisition? How do you actually get people to listen to it? So it did achieve what I wanted in the sense that we have this thing called intradays where especially in the past few years when we've hired a lot, we actually fly people to Stockholm for an onboarding session to learn about Spotify. And the leadership is on stage, talking about what they do and the departments and strategy and so forth. And it's very common that people come and tell me that, \"Oh, I listened to this podcast or this and the episode and it's at least one of the key reasons why I joined or sometimes the reason why I joined.\" So it's anecdotal, but it may be in the many tens of people, at least, who have said it. So that seems to work.\n\nLenny (00:12:12):\nThat's really interesting. Just again, and this comes up a few times on the podcast, is just the power of content in all these different ways for hiring for culture building. And it sounds like the original goal was just internally build this clinic culture and strategy.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:12:24):\nThat was the original goal, make senior leadership more approachable and reduce the distance and then also share more of the thinking in an entertaining way rather than just through docs that people end up not reading.\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\nI love that. So I was listening to it, as I said, and what was really interesting is I think episode four was actually all about AI, and I think your first attempts at leveraging machine learning in AI within Spotify. And I think that's what led to Discover Weekly and a few other tools. And that was years ago. And it's interesting listening to it now where AI is, again, a huge deal. And so I'm curious very tactically on the product team what you advise product managers and product teams on how to think about AI in their product thinking and also just in their day-to-day work.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:13:12):\nI can give a few examples there and I don't know that we're more sophisticated than anyone else, but we'll be doing at least the traditional machine learning for quite a long time. And I think in the podcast, I think I talked about the journey of the internet in stages. And one way to think about it is that the internet started with curation of the user curation. So you took something, some good, like people or books or music and you digitize it and you put it online, and then you ask users to curate it. And that was your Facebook, Spotify and so forth. And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:14:04):\nAnd I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products. So that's one lens. So I tend to talk to my teams about, even though it's all machine learning, I ask them to think of this as something completely different. The recommendation error was one type of machine learning. The generation error is a different type, so don't think of it as just more of the same, think of it as something actually completely new instead. And what we learned in ... Well, a few things. So if you look at this new era of large language models and the fusion models and so forth, there are two types of applications. As I said for the recommendation error, we had to rethink the user interface and the experience for recommendation first error.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:14:57):\nAnd so what does that mean in the generative area? No one really knows yet. As usual, there are a bunch of iterative improvements. So we use these large language models to improve our recommendations. You can have bigger vectors that can have more cultural knowledge. You can use it for safety classification on podcasts that no one has listened to yet and so forth. So there's lots of obvious improvements and we're doing those. But so far, we've only really done one real generative product in the hard definition, which is a product that couldn't have existed without generative AI, and that is the AI DJ. So that's a concept that we've been thinking about for a very long time. And the AI DJ is you press a button, a digitized person, there's a real person named X, digitized X. So he's now an AI, comes on and talks to you about music that you like and suggests music, and you can listen to it. And if you don't like it, you can just call him back and he says, \"Okay, now, let's listen to something maybe from a few summers ago,\" or \"Here's some new stuff that were trending yesterday in The Last of Us episode or something like that.\"\n\nGustav Söderström (00:16:10):\nSo that product couldn't have existed without generative AI, both generating the voice and generating the content of what the voice says. So you can have individualized, personalized voice at the scale of half a billion people. And so we had the use case we have seen for many, many years. Sometimes people call it the radio use case. We called it the zero intent use case internally when you actually don't know what you want to listen to at all.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:16:40):\nSpotify wasn't that good. Spotify was good when, at least roughly, you knew the use case of what you want to do, if it was a workout or dinner. We had lots of options for all of those. But if you really didn't know at all, it was hard to open Spotify and stare at it. And people used to say longingly that this was the one thing that radio was good at. Radio was quite bad, to be honest. I mean, it's not personalized to you at all. It's not on demand. You come in in the middle of things, it's actually terrible in many ways. But people still often say that there was something good about it. And I think that's something was the fact that you had a knob and you could just switch between contexts. It's like no, boring, boring, boring, boring, okay, this is good.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:17:23):\nAnd Spotify never had that mode of, I don't know what I want, but I want to cycle through things until I find something that I like. And I think with the AI DJ, that's actually the use case we managed to solve. So X comes on and says, \"I'm going to suggest something to you that you can listen to.\" And if you like it, you can keep listening, but if you don't like it, you bring him back again and you change channel. And for one reason or another, we tried to solve that for many times for a long time, but just starting to play a random song without any context as to why you would hear this, it just never worked. So that was our first foray into a product that couldn't exist before. And I think to your question of principles around that, there are a few pretty distinct principles that we've learned.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:18:09):\nOne that I really like that is not my principle at all, I think it is straight from Chris Dixon, is the principle of fault-tolerant user interfaces. So I can't say how many times during the early machine learning era when we said we're moving from curation to recommendation. I saw a design sketch that was a single big play button because clearly that is the simplest user interface you can do, but if you don't understand the performance of your machine learning, you can't design for it. The quality of your machine learning, if you're going to have a single play button, needs to be literally 100% or zero prediction error, and that's never the case. So let's say that you have a one in five hits, four out of five things are done, then you need a UI that probably at least shows five things at the same time on screen. So you have a one in five of something being relevant on screen.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:19:03):\nSo you need to understand the performance of your machine learning to design for it. It needs to be fault tolerant and often you need an escape hatch for the user. So you make a prediction. But if you were wrong, it needs to be super easy for the user say, \"No, you're wrong, I want to go to my library or to this or to that.\" So we have that principle of having fault-tolerant user interface and a user interface that corresponds to the current performance of your algorithms. And I think that is going to be true for generative machine learning as well. I think a very clear example actually is Mid Journey. If you think about the early Mid Journey user interface inside the Discord channel, actually generating an image was very, very slow.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:19:48):\nIt took a long time to generate high-quality image and they could have built the silver button thing where you put in a prompt, you wait for minutes, you get an image, and I think one out of four times, it's going to be bad. So you would've been disappointed three out of four times and it's a minute each, so like four minutes later, you'd be, \"This is a shitty product.\" What they did was they generated four simultaneous low-res images very quickly and you could say, \"So apparently, their performance was probably one in four, that's why they showed four and not six.\" And so one in four was usually pretty good. You click that one and either continue to iterate or scale it up. So that's also an example of, I think, people understanding where the performance of generative AI was when they built the UI. So that's something that I would be inspired by.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:20:37):\nAnd for the AI DJ specifically, another principle is to try to avoid this urge of just wanting to show off the technology and then have this voice that talk and talk and talk and talk. You have to remember that people came there for the music. So the principle for the AI DJ coming from the team, by the way, this was a bottoms-up product actually, it required a lot of support. We actually acquired big companies and so forth to be able to build it. But the idea had been built by teams bottom up. So the principle there was literally to do as little as possible and get out of the way. And I think that was really helpful. It's not telling you what the weather is and what happened in the news and going on and on and on about this band. It is trying to get you to the music and I think that's why it's working because it is working very well for us.\n\nLenny (00:21:24):\nI love this distinction between recommendation and generation. And this begs the question of, there's this trend that I imagine you're seeing of people autogenerating music using artists catalog. There's this Drake and The Weeknd thing that came out a week or two ago. Where do you think this ends up going and how do you think artists adjust to this world where music can just be autogenerated? This play button is all of it is generated versus just like the DJ in between the songs.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:21:53):\nFirst, big caveat, this is just super early. No one knows anything about how this is going to play out or the legal landscape and so forth, but I think it's going to have a lot of impact. And I think if we talk about two things, one is what it could do for music, the other is the right situation, and if rights-holders are getting compensated and so forth. So we talk about the first thing in isolation. I think an interesting example is right about when I grew up, Avicii came along. And it's interesting to think about because Avicii was not really considered by the existing music industry as a real artist because he couldn't really play an instrument and he couldn't sing, and he was just sitting with this computer in this DAW, digital audio workstation. And so it wasn't really considered real music. And I think now all of us consider it very real music and that he had tremendous real musical talent.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:22:51):\nSo I think right now, we're probably in the face where people say this isn't real music and it's somehow fake. I think the way to think about these diffusion models if and when they get good enough at generating music is probably the same like an instrument. It's just a much more powerful instrument and we'll probably see a new type of creator that wasn't proficient at any instrument and they couldn't assemble a full orchestra and do the thing that they had in their head and they can now generate very new things. I also think, by the way, that there is this distinction between AI music and real music that doesn't exist. For sure, very talented real musicians are using AI to get better and to help create new ideas. So that distinction doesn't really exist. It's all going to be AI. The question is what percentage, which makes the problem harder because you can't talk about if it should exist or not.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:23:50):\nYou have to talk about what percentage should exist and who gets to use it or not. But I think the way to think about it is probably as an instrument and that could help create a huge amount of art. And I think this is not news to you who probably use these things a lot, but I think if you don't use these generative models, there is the perception that you tell it to create a hit and you will get that. That's not how it works. Actually, what these models do is because they've been listening to a lot of music, they are very good at doing something that sounds very similar to what already exists. Actually being original is very hard. And from one point of view, as it now gets easier to create more generic music, it will actually be more difficult than ever to be truly unique.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:24:39):\nSo I still think there would be tremendous skill in creating something truly unique. And my hope would be that what happened with the DAW and that technology jump was you got a whole new genre like EDM that you couldn't really produce it with an orchestra or live. And maybe we'll see completely new music styles with these technologies. I think that would be very exciting. So that's on the positive side, but then you have the rights issue, which I have a lot of empathy for. And Spotify specifically has seen this before. So we had a different technology shift like this, which was the technology shift to online downloads of music and piracy and peer to peer. So first, it was a big technology shift in peer to peer and it was exciting for consumers. More consumers started listening to more music than ever. And I think that's where we are now with generative AI.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:25:31):\nThere's a new technology, but it also required a new business model before creators and industry could actually participate and benefit from this. And that's, obviously, self-serving to say because we were a big part of innovating that business model. But I still think that's what's necessary and I hope that that's what I and we could be part of. So I think we've seen the first part, the technology shift, and there will probably be a lot of discussion and chaos here which have a lot of empathy for, but I think we haven't seen the second part yet. What is a model where this could be a benefit? What actually happened after piracy is that the music industry got bigger than ever, not just as big but bigger than ever. And I think that could happen with this technology as well. But we're right in the beginning.\n\nLenny (00:26:20):\nSo along the same lines, something else you teach is this idea of all truly great products have to pull some magic trick. This comes up in your podcast a lot and I think you mentioned this other places, and thinking about all the stuff you're talking about here, it feels like, in a sense, everything's going to feel like magic because AI's baked into it.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:26:38):\nI think when we did the AI DJ, we did a small version of that. When people first listened to it, we could see that reaction in use of testing when they've wondered ... So the magic trick there was that how could they record this person saying so many different things because it's talking about my music. So the magic trick was, obviously, didn't record a person saying, it's generated, and that magic trick wears off. You hear it all the time now and so forth, but it was one of those magic tricks. So I still think that concept is important and it seems to correlate with products going viral and taking off.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:27:15):\nAnd I think it was the same using something like Dall-E or Stable Diffusion or Mid Journey the first time. It completely seemed like a magic trick. And, obviously, there is no magic, it's just data and statistics. But I think getting to that point and iterating a product to the point where it feels like magic the first time is very helpful. And it's often a question of just getting the performance to a certain level, scoping down, removing things. There's a lot of fine-tuning, I think, that makes you cross that line from it's cool and impressive but not magic to it feels like magic. I don't understand how this could be done.\n\nLenny (00:28:00):\nYeah, it reminds me of the launch of GBT which ended up being the biggest, most fastest growing product in history, and it's like the epitome of a magic trick. It feels like actual magic.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:28:09):\nAbsolutely, absolutely. And to most people, it is still very ... Actually to a lot of ascent, even to researchers, it's a little bit magical. No one really understands fully. So I guess there's maybe some magic left in the world.\n\nLenny (00:28:23):\nAbsolutely. And I think a lot of people are worried about not understanding what's going on there. Shifting to the way you all build product at Spotify. So Spotify is famous for popularizing this idea of squads and tribes. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys have moved away from that approach.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:28:39):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nLenny (00:28:41):\nOkay. So I'd love to understand just why you shifted and what you learned from that approach to building product, and then just like how do you organize the teams now? What do you do now?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:28:51):\nThis was something that we focused a lot on early and it turned out to be smart of us to name these things into squads and chapters and so forth. It wasn't really ... Well, maybe it was deliberately branding, but it wasn't for purposes of branding that we made it up. We made it up because we thought it was a good structure to use and we needed names for things and this was the early internet eras you were allowed to make things up. And so it was very good for where we were at the time and it certainly helped us in recruiting. It's become a little bit of a cost to us because people still think that we organize that way and it's not a very efficient way of being organized at this scale or maybe even if you started over right now because we've learned more.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:29:35):\nBut I think the big difference is the idea with the squad specifically was twofold. They were supposed to be small and full stack. So squad should be about seven people and it should have front and backend, mobile, QA, agile coaches and so forth, and it should be very autonomous was the idea. And that's really what we shifted. So, first of all, as you grow the company, scaling in increments of seven engineers just creates a ton of overhead. So, obviously, our teams now tend to be much bigger, maybe two, three times that at least per manager to maybe have 14 or something instead of seven and just less overhead roles. So that's one. It looks more traditional as you learn more and is reasonable as you scale. The second big thing I think we struggle with was back then when I joined, the average age at Spotify was ... I mean, I was the oldest and this was 14 years ago. So I think the average age was probably under 30 or something and it wasn't most tech companies.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:30:46):\nAnd so we had coming from Sweden, which is a different culture than the US, and I love a lot of things about Swedish culture and I think we managed to keep the best parts, but Sweden is a very bottoms-up autonomous culture. There's this famous drawing on how you make decisions in Sweden. In the US, I think it's just a hierarchy. In Sweden, it's a circle. It's in a circle, no one is in the middle, there is no leader and so forth.\n\nLenny (00:31:13):\nInteresting.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:31:14):\nSo I think by culture, we're very inspired by this super autonomous thing. And I think the idea with autonomy is very reasonable and the right one, which is we work and we are hiring the smartest people we can find and we pay high salaries for that. So if you're hiring smart people, one way to think about it is you're renting brain power.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:31:39):\nSo if you're renting all of this expensive brain power and then you give them no room to think for themselves, that doesn't sound smart, then you should actually hire less smart people and keep your costs down or something. So I think you have to give a bunch of autonomy to actually maximize the value of the investment you're making. So that's very reasonable that you would give a lot of space for people to use as much of their talent and capacity as possible. But the problem with that is if you put autonomy very far towards the leaves of the organization, and also if you combine that with having a very junior organization, which we did back then, there's a fair chance that you're just going to produce heat. You're going to have a hundred squads with a hundred strategies running in a hundred directions. And Spotify has been there in that camp.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:32:29):\nI mean, we managed to get somewhere, for sure, in spite of this, but I'd struggle to say we were efficient in doing that. So we've done a few things. The team structure is more traditional, larger teams, less overhead. And we've been specifically working with where in the org do we put the autonomy because the extremes are at the leaves and we were there. The other extreme may be at the top, let's say maybe some Twitter, there's one person. Both have problems. If you have it at the leaves, you're going to produce a lot of heat. If you have it at the top, you need someone with a lot of capacity and Elon has a lot of capacity, but you are, by definition, going to bottleneck. All decisions have to go through there. And Daniel, it's not his personality that he even wants to make all the decisions.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:33:19):\nHe wants to maximize throughput rather than to bottleneck the throughput. So the question is, if it's not at the top and not at the very bottom, where do you put it? And what we've found, which I don't think is very contrarian at all, I think this is the case in most companies, is around the VP level. So if you have Daniel, then you have the C level, myself and others, then you have the VP level, that is a good mix of instead of having one person in the company think, so only Daniel then and the rest just do, you have on the VP level in the company this many tens to maybe hundreds of people that have a lot of autonomy to think. So you get a good amount of freedom of thought and people thinking in different directions, but it's not like 8,000 people. And these people on the VP level are both quite a lot of them, but they're also usually quite senior. They have a lot of pattern recognition.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:34:16):\nSo I think that solves for, it's a good ... If you think of it as an optimization problem, it's a good optimization space. So the autonomy level in Spotify now tends to be quite high at the VP level and then lower around those levels.\n\nLenny (00:34:33):\nAnd when you say autonomy, what does that actually mean? Is it the VP of, say, the podcasting product has a lot of say over what happens and there's not a ton of ... I don't know how involved are people above? And I know Maya's the VP of product, I believe, for the podcast product.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:34:48):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:34:49):\nWho I think is going to come on the podcast someday. What does that mean in terms of Tommy for her, what practically?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:34:54):\nSo it means that I would ask Maya to define a strategy for what we do in podcasting, how are we going to be different, why would a podcaster want to be here? Whereas another company, I will make that strategy or another company, Daniel would make that strategy. Same with ... The AI DJ, for example, came from our personalization team. And so that was a bet that they made. So they have autonomy to make those kinds of bets and define strategies. Same with the user interface, we have an experienced team, can talk about the org structure later, but I put a lot of autonomy on the VP of experience to define and suggest what it is that we want to do. And in other companies, I would define all of that myself, for example.\n\nLenny (00:35:45):\nJust going even a little bit further here, I know you have just strong opinions on the way to organize teams and how the organization helps you optimize for specific things. What are your just thoughts along those lines and what have you learned about how the impact of organization and what you're optimizing for?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:36:03):\nYeah. So I talk about an idealized spectrum or maybe not idealized but exaggerated spectrum. Nothing is really true, but you create extremes to make a point. So on one spectrum, you have something like Amazon, which is known for two-pizza teams, no dependencies. You try to minimize dependencies so you can run in parallel. Teams compete with each other even on the same project and so forth. But they have direct access to the user.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:36:37):\nAnd so the benefit here is if you have an idea, the time to get the user is very low and it has worked for them. It's produced Kindle, it produced Alexa, it's produced a lot of very novel things. There are a few interesting downsides here. One downside that I'm extremely impressed with Jeff Bezos' foreseeing is if you have teams that compete with each other, the incentives are to hide your results, hide your code. And that should make for an organization that gets no platform leverage because no one's corporating. And I think either he had that insight or because he saw this, he had to do this, but he's well known for pushing extremely hard on hard APIs. If you don't create hard APIs to your technology, you're out. And if you think about it, it has to be that way because otherwise no one would do it.\n\nLenny (00:37:32):\nAnd a hard API is essentially everyone knows how to use this API and connect to this team to interface with.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:37:38):\nExactly. You have to expose your technology to others. You have to maintain those APIs and they have to be very structured because otherwise the whole thing would collapse as everyone's supposed to compete because there are no incentives. You have to centrally force that. And interestingly, even though theoretically then they're the worst position to have a structured platform, I think, because they forced it so hard, they were the ones who did Amazon Web Services because they had such hard defined APIs because of this rule that it was easier for them to turn it inside out and expose it the rest of the world. Whereas if you look at someone like Google, I think they struggled more with externalizing their APIs maybe because it is so friendly and soft. So they didn't need as hard APIs on the inside because there was no competition. People could just go into each other's code.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:38:18):\nSo it's interesting anecdote around it, but the main point is you're faster there, but it's going to be hard to corporate. And so you will see something like maybe exaggerating a bit. Sometimes you'll see multiple search boxes on the same page from different teams. And this has been true in Spotify, by the way, as well. You've seen multiple toasters on the Now Playing view coming up from different teams because they're working. When we were in the autonomous mode, everyone running. And then ... So you get the benefit of speed, but you get the drawback of shipping your org chart and shipping complexity to the end user. But clearly, that's been the right choice for Amazon because they're a trillion-dollar company. But then on the other spectrum, you have something like Apple who's also a trillion-dollar company. So clearly, both models work, where you would never see two search boxes from the same team popping up on an iPhone. That is centrally organized by something that is close to single individual.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:39:20):\nSo they are instead in what is probably the world's biggest largest functional org, they're doing as much. If you think about what goes into the Apple, I mean, they certainly do everything we do. They have music service, podcast service, audiobooks, and they have a billion other services. So it's not like they have an easier problem. And yet they build something that feels more like it was built by a single developer for a single user. So they centralize and they have this bottlenecking function that everything has to go through and be decided how it fits with everything else. And so that has the benefit of the user experience being simpler and not shipping the org chart and increasing complexity. But it also has the drawback of speed without having facts on it. I've heard people working at Apple have said, \"Yeah, it took seven years to get that thing to market,\" because you just had to wait in the pipeline.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:40:17):\nSo you have these extremes. And I think the most interesting example, I think, to think about is when you double click the power button on an iPhone, the Apple Pay comes up. That decision, how did that happen? You can imagine that all the services team would like to pop up when you double click that button. And so someone had to decide, should music come up, should payments come up, should something else come up? And so they have a different structure there. And on that spectrum of centralized versus decentralized, because of our strategy, which is we're a single application, trying to add or not trying to, we have added multiple types of content with actually very different business models on the backend, rev shares and royalties and book deals and so forth into single user experience. That is our strategy. We think the user experience in keeping that simple is the most important thing.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:41:12):\nSo we've chosen more of the centralized model, where these different vertical businesses, if you think about it, the music business, podcast, audiobooks business, they have it to go through a single recommendation organization because that's another problem. Which one do you recommend to which user? Should be a book or podcast or music? And how do you weigh them against each other? And also the user interface could easily get incredibly complicated if everyone built their own UI. The music team built their UI and then someone added features on top. So that's how we chose to optimize. But it is based on our strategy and I think both models work.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month, Eco users earned an average of $84 in cashback rewards. How? With Eco, the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system. Providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middleman, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically. What if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cashback, plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the Eco app.\n\nLenny (00:42:40):\nEco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever. So it pays to be early. Sound too good to be true? Go to eco.com/lenny, sign up for an onboarding and find out why it isn't. Lenny's Podcast listeners who attend an Eco welcome session will get an exclusive 4% APY on deposits over $1,000. Learn more at eco.com/lenny, that's E-C-O.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:43:05):\nIt's interesting these two examples you gave, Apple and Amazon, they're two of the biggest companies in the world and they're like at the extremes of these two into the spectrum. And it's interesting, most companies are somewhere in the middle. I wonder if there's just a benefit to being in an extreme and that ends up being really important.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:43:21):\nI think so. In almost all industries, you have this smiling curve concept, where you want to be at the extremes on the smiling curve, and that's where big business opportunities are but not in the middle. So it's probably true in terms of organizational models as well.\n\nLenny (00:43:34):\nSpeaking of extremes, I want to talk a bit about taking big bets. So you guys had this big launch event recently where you basically redesigned the whole primary feed of Spotify to make it feel more like where apps are going, like TikTok reels feel of just stream, and you start hearing videos and music starts playing and some people loved it, some people did not. And I'm curious as a product leader, how you think about thinking long term and dealing with people that are just like, \"What the hell's ... I hate change, stop changing things.\" How do you think about that? Who do you listen to? Who do you ignore? How do you know to stay the course? How do you approach that?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:44:10):\nYeah, you're being very kind. There was a lot of negative feedback on Twitter on some of that. So let me actually dig into some detail because I think for product people listening to this, this is an interesting lesson that I think few companies talk about because you want talk about everything that went exactly as you thought they would and you don't want to talk about the things that didn't go exactly as you thought they would.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:44:39):\nSo I'll go through what we are trying to achieve and what we learned. So Spotify is mainly a background application, and for a long time, we've been considered very good at background music and podcast recommendation. When the phone is in your pocket and you're listening to an EDM playlist or pop playlist or something, we're really good at inserting another EDM track there or another pop track there or something like that in the background.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:45:09):\nWhat we hear from users again and again, though, is that they say that they get trapped in a taste bubble. So I love my Spotify, I love this, but I'm a little bit bored with EDM now and Spotify's not suggesting something completely new. And if you think about that problem, it may sound similar to the recommendation problem, it's just another recommendation problem, but it's actually fundamentally different because when you're recommending another EDM track inside the EDM playlist, you have a lot of signal from that user that they like EDM. But if you're going to recommend a completely new genre, by definition, you have no idea. Because if you had an idea, it wasn't new to them. So you can't know anything. So back to hit rate, your hit rate is going to be incredibly low when you suggest something completely new to the user.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:46:03):\nSo this problem of helping people get out of the taste bubble isn't that easy as it sounds. And we can't really take some genre that maybe isn't typical. So I'm a big fan of Reggaeton, for example. It's not typically ... It's not that common in Sweden. And if you would look the rest of my profile, it's EDM heaviness, you probably wouldn't have guessed it. And Spotify wouldn't have guessed it. So if I'm listening to my favorite EDM playlist in the background or maybe my metal playlist, metal is very big in Sweden, it's really hard for us to just insert a Reggaeton track in the middle of that. Most people are going to think Spotify's broken.\n\nLenny (00:46:41):\nYeah.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:46:41):\nWhat the hell are they thinking? So that doesn't really work. So in order to help people break out of their taste bubbles, you need something different. You need something where your hit ratio can be very low and you need people to expect it to be very low.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:47:00):\nSo when we recommend things in the background, our hit ratio needs to be at least nine out of 10, maybe one dud is okay, but if you get five duds, you're going to think we broke your playlist and your session. We need something where one out of 10 is a success. If you find one gem out of 10 tries, you're very happy. So you need a completely different paradigm. And you also need to be able to go through many candidates quickly because the hit rate is so low. You can't take three minutes per item. It's like, \"Okay, I didn't like this,\" and it's still like two minutes left before the next one comes on. You need to quickly say, \"No, no, no.\" So the obvious candidates for this are these feed-type experience, where you can go through lots of content, you're expecting the hit ratio to be much lower. And if you don't like it, the cost is very low, you just swipe.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:47:50):\nAnd then this is the reason why people have been ... When they want to break out of their taste bubbles or when they come into Spotify and listen to something completely new, it is usually because they found it on one of these services, like a TikTok or YouTube or something, where they get exposed to lots of new content. So people were asking us for these tools and so that's what we wanted to solve for. And so we built a bunch of features, feed-like structures, where you can go through either a new genre with many tracks or a podcast channel with genre with many episodes or even full playlists. And we implemented those and we put them in something called subfeeds. So in the current experience, and this is roll out worldwide, if you click the podcast subfeed, you get a feed of podcast episodes. Click the music subfeeds, you get a feed of playlists where you can go through many playlists. And if you don't understand the name, you can quickly hear what they sound like and check out a few tracks and understand if this is for you. And if you go through the search and browse page, you can find completely new genres that you can quickly go through.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:48:59):\nAnd so those are working as we intended. People go to them when they want to find new music. They browse through them and they save new songs. So they're working as we intended. The thing that didn't work as we intended was when users asked us for this again and again, we took the sum of these things and we put it on Home because people ask so much about discovery and we can see clearly how correlated discoveries with retention on Spotify and so forth. But what we misjudged or failed or rather learned about our own homepage is that the way it works right now, and this is what you can see in the Twitter comment, if you remove the angry voices and try to see what they're saying, they're saying the following, which is actually quite clear in the quantitative data as well, that if you look at what people do on Spotify's homepage, the current one, it is almost 90% what we call recall.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:49:59):\nSo it is either getting to a session that you're already in or a specific playlist that you know you want to get to or at least a specific use case. So you come in with a high intent, you actually knew what you wanted, and maybe only 10% of the time as a true discovery, like I don't know what I want. So if you think about, that is 90% recall and 10% discovery. When we tested the design ... So the subfeeds were working and not working, but when we tested some of them on Home, we switched it from 90/10 to 10/90. So 10% recall, 90% discovery. And while people want discovery, they probably don't want 90% discovery, instead of 90% recall. So if you then look at the comments on Twitter, what they're saying is like, \"Hey, I can't find my playlists anymore. Where are these things?\"\n\nGustav Söderström (00:50:47):\nThey're not really complaining about the discovery, they're complaining about the things they don't get anymore. And we can see this in the quant data as well. And you can see traffic shifting from home into search and into library, which is a clear sign people are trying to find the things they can't find anymore. And you can even see people then trying to use these discovery tools which are optimized for quickly understanding new things to do the recall. Where's that workout playlist I know I want? And it's actually very bad UI for recall, it's like a slot machine, right? Very unpredictable if you ever get to that workout playlist. It was optimized for finding new things, not for recall of existing things. When you do recall, you want the dense UI with many items on screen because you know what it is you're looking for. So you don't need a lot of real estate when you're doing discovery of new things. You want a lot of pixels and you probably want sound because you don't know what it is.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:51:40):\nSo what we learn about our UI, and I think there's maybe a little bit of product jealousy here, you always look at other experiences. And if you look around, it could be forgiven for thinking that most other products, if you look at something like YouTube, for example, their homepage is exactly that. It's a huge single-item discovery feed with only new items. And people don't seem to tweet angrily about how angry they are at you to say they love YouTube and it's a big product. And I think what we discovered was that we actually did something really well on our homepage, which was supporting you being inside a multiple sessions at the same time. So you could be in the middle of two podcasts and an audiobook and also them actually I just want to get to that workout playlist. I don't remember the name of it, but I know it's workout.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:52:31):\nWe actually did that part really well. I would venture just say much better than the other experiences where you literally have to go to some tab and into library and start browsing to get back to where you were. And so maybe it's path dependent. Because we have done recall pretty well, people got, I think, reasonably upset when they couldn't do the recall anymore. And we didn't want lose that because it was one of the things we did well and underestimated. And my takeaway is actually we do it better than other experiences. So we certainly want to keep that. So what we did was now we're just updating their hypothesis to achieve the same goal, which is these things are working and when people want to discover, they use them and they seem to work, they can also get better.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:53:20):\nYou're on this hill-climbing journey from a machine learning point of view, but the question is, how do you make sure that whenever people feel that they are in that I'm trapped in my taste bubble, they understand that these things are there and they're easy to use? So now we have a version of Home that we are also testing, obviously, where these things are very available but voluntary and you can still do all of the recall. And so from my point of view, this is the reason we A/B test because you want to be scientific about it and you want to learn as much as possible about your own product and your users. And now I'm sharing a lot of the learnings. Maybe we should keep them to ourselves, but my hunch is that it's going to make it a much better product.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:54:09):\nBut what I told my teams when we went into this, because I've done this a few times, agree to signing, I think there are two fundamentally different types of product development. One is designing a new feature. It is hard, but it's voluntary for people to use. So you do the AI DJ. Some people love it, that's fine. If you don't like it, it didn't make it worse for you. But when you redesign, it is much more tricky because it's not voluntary to participate in the redesign. So there's a cost even for people who don't like it. Then you have a very tricky problem here, which is there are going to be two types of feedback. One is you did something and it was right, but people are upset because you changed stuff. The other is you did something and it wasn't right, and people are also upset but for good reasons.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:55:08):\nAnd so how do you separate these two? Because I think I explained this to ... When we talk through this with my teams, I think the analogy to think about is you have your desktop, your physical desktop, you have your computer in one place, you have your pencil over here, you have your notebook over there, and I come in and I just rearrange all of it. And you have spent, in our case, maybe 12 years with that setup. It doesn't matter if I have a lot of quantitative data that my new setup is better, you're going to get upset because you are effective in this old setup. And it's hard to tell those apart. The most classic use case is the Facebook newsfeed, which people are very upset about when it became a single newsfeed. But it turned out to solve a lot of user problems that you didn't have to run around all of Facebook collecting events yourself.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:55:58):\nSo there are some ways of understanding if you made it better, but people's habits are broken or if it's not better. And one thing is, for example, to look at new user cohorts that don't have that behavior versus all user cohorts and so forth. So we went through all of this with the teams. Before we did it, I said, \"This is going to be painful.\" There's probably going to be a lot of tweets because chances that we get it exactly right are very low. So for that reason, it hasn't been very hard on the team. It is hard ... You want to respond to people, but the right way to do it is to listen, understand, try new hypothesis to really figure out what's going on. So I think I've done it maybe three or four times now. Three maybe. One unsuccessful, two successfully. So kind of knew what I was getting into.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:56:45):\nSo it's almost like you punish yourself, very painful, but also the most exciting things. And I think any product person knows that the easiest, the most straightforward thing to do is to iterate around where you are. There's no risk. You're not going to get fired, no user is going to get angry. But everyone also knows that eventually if you don't adapt new technologies, new paradigms, et cetera, you're going to get replaced. You have to find this balance of trying new things. And when you work in software, you have this tool of A/B testing and being scientific about it. When you build hardware, it's worse. If you're wrong, you're wrong. You can't update.\n\nLenny (00:57:26):\nI love this story. I so appreciate you sharing it. I imagine also with a big launch like this, you can't actually A/B test it ahead of time because of the press season. They're like, \"Oh my God, look what Spotify's doing.\" And so you're limited there. Imagine, right? You couldn't really test this ahead of time.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:57:40):\nThe hardest thing about this is if you're trying something completely new, the MVP needs to be very big so you can build a new IU, but if you didn't do algorithms for single item feed, you can't tell if it was the right idea but poor machine learning, right? UI poor machine learning. Or you have to build a lot and that gets quite expensive. That's actually ... The biggest why it's painful is not really the feedback from the outside. It is the cost you have to take on the inside. You incur a lot of costs as you're really hoping you're right.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:58:15):\nAnd in our cases, the changes on the homepage aren't that hard for us to do. The important thing is that the underlying hypothesis of, can we help you break out of your taste bubble actually works and then you update the acquisition funnels into that experience. But I think the problem is that you need to get so many things in place to be able to say, \"You might get a false negative,\" just because you didn't do it well or not. That's the biggest challenge, I think, with these big rewrites where everyone has to update everything before you can know if you're right or wrong.\n\nLenny (00:58:52):\nWhat was that process like of helping you understand what is not working and what is working and what you wanted to change? I imagine there's a bunch of data you're looking at, some tweets, things like that. What was the tactical, \"Oh, shoot, something's not going the way we expected, here's what we should do?\"\n\nGustav Söderström (00:59:08):\nWell, the feeds, we tested, but the home feed, we rolled out and tested afterwards. And we tested out on users, a few different variants of it. And then we got the data back and we looked more at the quantitative data. And we do a lot of user research where people sit and use the feeds to understand and build our own theorem mind of what is working and what is not working. And then, obviously, you look at user feedback, of course, and some users are very good at expressing what is of it that isn't working, others are not as good as expressing what isn't working. So it can be hard to parse that, but certainly, that's a factor as well.\n\nGustav Söderström (00:59:49):\nAnd so then once you do that, then you have quantitative data to look at. And then you sit in recent through, what do you think is right and wrong? What are the different hypotheses? What is working, what is not working? And then just update and test again and again until you prove or disprove your hypothesis. Trying to be as scientific as possible about it. And also I think the biggest risk also when you've invested so much time in something is getting precious about things. You have to just be brutal. You have to believe in things 100% until the data says no and then you believe in something else 100%. That sounds easy. It's very hard to do, to the extent that people get upset when you do it because, for some reason, people don't like when people change their minds. It is what we should want from everyone. I would love a politician who said, \"I'd looked at the data and I realized actually this is right and now I believe this.\" But we hate politicians that do that. They feel untrustworthy and we ridicule them.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:00:56):\nSo I think that's the biggest risk with anyone. You just have to be unemotional and just look at the proof and the data. And then if you do that, you just move on and then you get to where you want to be, and you solve the same problem but you adapt.\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\nI really like that philosophy. Essentially, it's the idea of strong opinions loosely held. Is that-\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:19):\nExactly. Exactly what it is. And it sounds so easy, but it's hard.\n\nLenny (01:01:23):\nRight? Because to your point, people don't respect someone changing their mind. They're like, \"Oh, I see, they were wrong the whole time and they were so confident about being wrong.\"\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:31):\nYeah, exactly. And it's unclear why it is what we should want, but I think it has something to do with human psychology. We actually tend to love profits and people who hold very strong opinions with very little data. Those are the people we like. People will look at a lot of data and actually that, we don't like. Not sure why.\n\nLenny (01:01:57):\nWe're flawed creatures.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:59):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\nIs there something that you've recently changed your mind about along these same lines that maybe comes to mind of like, \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:06):\nNo, I think these learnings about the science system and homepage does really well, maybe better than others, that we don't want to wash out with a bath water or whatever the [inaudible 01:02:20] expression is. I think that's the biggest current learning I'm actually very happy about.\n\nLenny (01:02:26):\nYeah, I love learning that we're doing some really well that we didn't really realize necessarily and maybe we should lead into that more.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:34):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:02:35):\nGoing in a somewhat different direction. Shishir Mehrotra suggested to ask you something. He's on your board, I believe.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:41):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:02:41):\nAnd he suggested to ask you about your 10% planning time. What is that about?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:46):\nThis is a concept that I think Shishir has used for a long time ever since he worked at YouTube. And the idea is that, roughly, you shouldn't be spending more than 10% of your time planning versus executing or building, which means that if you're working quarterly 10 weeks, you should spend one week planning as we work in six-month increment. So we try to spend two weeks planning and roughly successful. And this is ... Actually, when we talk about org models, give a shout-out to Brian Chesky at Airbnb, who is actually one of the first, I think, to have these more contrarian old models. He's much more applesque than most of Silicon Valley. He also works in six-month increments. He has a lot of experience in that as well. So that's what the 10% planning time is. And I think if you find yourself planning much more than that, you're either planning too much or your execution period is just too short for that amount of planning. It's a rule of thumb, but I find that it works.\n\nLenny (01:03:53):\nI asked a few PMs what I should ask you, PMs that work at Spotify actually, that I haven't told you. And someone pointed out that you always bring a lot of energy and clarity to a room. That's something they see you as really strong at. What have you learned about just the importance of that or just how to do that well as a leader?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:04:11):\nWell, that's great to hear. I didn't know that so I'm trying to figure out what to answer. I think that the energy, I don't know. I guess I'm just excited about what I do. I've always been excited about technology. I love seeing new things. My core drive is still this notion of you see something which I think you'll empathize with that doesn't exist yet. And you're like, \"Wow, I wonder if that could exist. That would be so cool.\" And then in order to get people to do it, you try to share that excitement. So I don't think I can bring a lot of energy for something I'm not excited about. So I have to work on things I actually believe in and that I'm excited about. And so maybe then the energy comes more naturally. Unfortunately, for me, so far, Spotify has been in this phase where a lot of innovation is allowed and I'm even asked to try to do new cool things.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:05:09):\nMaybe I would have less energy for a pure optimization phase. On the clarity, I've always liked trying to explain things. It's a well-known fact that the best way to understand something is to try to explain to someone else. So I go around explaining things to people who didn't ask for it and not to sound smart, but to see if I actually understood it. And so maybe it's that practice. And on that note, I actually do ask my leaders that work for me and I ask them to ask their leaders to always explain themselves. And I think when ... We talked a little bit about autonomy and so forth, we don't promise everyone that they have to agree, but I think the promise we should make to all employees is that even if they don't agree, they should be entitled to understand why you're making the decision.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:06:06):\nWhat I don't think is acceptable is to say, \"No, we're going to do it this way because I'm more senior. I've seen this a bunch of times. You are not smart enough.\" All of those things. I think you have to explain yourself so you owe an explanation. And I find that valuable back to the only way to understand something is to explain it because it usually turns out that if you can't explain it yourself, you probably don't really even understand it yourself. Sometimes I think it's possible that you can have product instincts that are good but you can't express them. But most of them, when people say there's something there but they can't explain it, they actually don't understand it themselves. And many times, there actually isn't anything there. And also if you can explain it as a product person, that knowledge is now shared. So it just becomes much more effective for the organization. So sometimes I try to provoke people a little bit and say ... When people ask how much is art versus science, I say, \"It's 0% art, 0% magic, and 100% science.\" And that's because I want to force people to try to explain it. I think we use the word art and magic. We have historically used the word art and magic for anything that we couldn't yet explain.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:07:33):\nGenetics was magic and art until it was science. And quantum physics was magic until it was science. And most recently, actually, intelligence and creativity was art and magic until it was statistics in an LLM. So I think I try to push people to say, \"Are you sure you can explain this?\" because that forces people to think through. So maybe I like it and I try to force it on people. So maybe that's why people think I sometimes bring clarity.\n\nLenny (01:08:07):\nI love that. Question along those lines, is there a system or an approach to explaining that you recommend? Is it just write it out in a document? Is it explaining in a certain style or is it just however is natural to the person?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:08:20):\nI used to write everything and then write and rewrite and make it more and more condensed. So that worked for me. I don't write as much anymore. Now, I tend to walk and talk in my head myself. What I actually do is I ... And I found this different for different people and a lot of people want to bounce something with someone else, that's how they think. You repeat the same thing again and again and you get some feedback on it. And so I used to write a lot. I sometimes do when it's an idea I want to understand better. And at some point in my life, I would love to write something real like a book or something. But what I do increasingly now is I do my one-on-ones with peers or people who report to me or something, and I just put on AirPods and do a distributed walk and talk.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:09:12):\nBoth people are walking but in different locations and you spend an hour discussing something. That has actually turned out to be very, very fruitful. So then you get the power of you're not alone so you get more brain power than your own. And I don't think there is strong evolutionary proof for this, but there's certainly indications that you're thinking better when you're walking, whether it's because you're oxygenating your brain or because it's evolutionary for some other reason, I'm not sure. But I found that walking, talking, and thinking actually even if you're not in person, just over AirPods, it's super effective. It was the pandemic that forced us. I thought we would get less creative and strategizing will suffer during the pandemic and I found the opposite. We had more of this than ever and I started thinking about why, and I think it's all of these walk and talks that we did.\n\nLenny (01:10:07):\nYou threw out there that you want to write a book someday. What do you think your book would be about?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:10:11):\nI have no idea. I have no idea. Statistically, it's probably going to be about something that I did a lot, so it has to be about something with technology or product or something. But I would love to write something fictional. That'd be a lot of fun.\n\nLenny (01:10:26):\nOh, boy. I'll pre-order as soon as that's up. Another concept I wanted to touch on that another PM suggested, which is he called it the P in the pants analogy. Does that ring a bell? And is that interesting to talk about?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:10:40):\nI don't know exactly which occasion this person is referring to, but I know I've used that analogy a few times.\n\nLenny (01:10:49):\nOkay. Promising.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:10:50):\nI don't know if it's like a Swedish analogy because I thought it was more widely known. But the idea is that you do something ... So the saying is that's like peeing in your pants in cold weather. It feels really warm and nice to begin with. And then after a while, you start to regret it. It's about being short term, basically. So now I just say that's like peeing in the pants inside because people know what I mean. It's a short-term thing.\n\nLenny (01:11:21):\nThat's a hilarious way of communicating that idea. Must be a Swedish thing.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:11:25):\nYes, I think Swedish people do it for some reason, apparently others don't.\n\nLenny (01:11:30):\nMaybe because it's cold a lot of times of the year.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:11:33):\nYes. That's probably it. This is a saying in cold climate. In the warm, it doesn't help. No one understands what you mean.\n\nLenny (01:11:39):\nSpeaking of Sweden, do you watch Succession?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:11:42):\nYes, I do.\n\nLenny (01:11:43):\nOkay. So Sweden's become a big part of the show, specifically the company trying to ... I guess I don't want to spoil, but there's a character that's really important. Yes, exactly. That is Swedish. And so I'm curious just what do you think of the way they portray the Swedish culture and Swedish business dealings?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:11:59):\nIt's super fun to see this as a Sweden. And I guess, first and foremost, like anyone or any person or any country that gets represented by super tall, well-built, great looking Alexander Skarsgård should probably be pretty happy. So that's good. Then I think there's this episode where they are in Norway, without giving away too much.\n\nLenny (01:12:25):\nYep.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:12:26):\nThere are elements that are authentic. There's a lot of, I think, paid brand positioning from a Swedish brand named Fjällräven, which I think means arctic fox, which is actually a very popular outdoor brand in Sweden. So that's authentic. The sauna things and so forth are authentic. So it's real, but it's exaggerated. Actually, the thing that isn't very authentic is his negotiation style. Swedish people tend to be serious, cautious, and this guy's more of a player. So he's not the typical Swedish businessman from a negotiation tactic point of view, I think.\n\nLenny (01:13:11):\nYeah, it doesn't make me think of the way you described it where in Sweden, people sit in a circle and no one's in the center.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:13:15):\nNo, exactly. He's very much in the center.\n\nLenny (01:13:19):\nAnd then when people go saunas, there are just like a chant, sauna, sauna [inaudible 01:13:23].\n\nGustav Söderström (01:13:23):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:13:24):\nThe last episode.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:13:25):\nIt's a great show. I love it.\n\nLenny (01:13:26):\nI love it. This season is insane. I'm so curious where it all goes. Maybe just the last question before very exciting lightning round. Spotify is, at this point, the biggest podcasting platform for me specifically and I think globally, and I love using it. It works great. I'm curious just what's next for Spotify and specifically Spotify podcasting.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:13:48):\nThere are two sides to it. It's for Spotify creators and for Spotify listeners. For Spotify creators, there are two things. One is, and this is what we talked about at Stream On, we talked about it also for music discovery, but it's the same problem and even harder for podcast. So we're still focused very heavily on helping podcast creators find more audience. This is ... Like I said, it's even a bigger problem to break out of your habits and your bubbles in podcasting. Such a big investment to find a new podcast. And so that is something, I think, we could and should do really well. So we keep investing a lot there. And as I said, you'll see more as we roll up more features now.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:14:37):\nThe other big need for creators is monetization and you can monetize today in many ways with DEI and Spotify SEI and so forth. But we're working hard to expand that and make it better because the industry is starting to mature and I think this is one of the biggest needs and the biggest things we could do for creators to help them monetize better, actually both free and paid. We also have paid podcast. So that's on the creator side.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:15:07):\nOn the consumer side, I don't want to share too much. We've shown that we're investing a lot in discovery. I want to keep some secrets for when they roll out, but we are investing a lot in the user expense itself. I think it's far from optimal yet what it could be. One thing that I can share that we're investing a lot in is just the ubiquity and playback across different devices and in cars and all these things that we've done well for music. But I think the listening experience can get a lot more seamless. I think search can get better. The data about podcasts and ... Well, I don't want to say too much, but looking at AI and generative technology, there is a lot that can be done.\n\nLenny (01:15:52):\nAll right. Well, I'll take what I can get. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, Gustav. Are you ready?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:16:01):\nI think I am. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:16:03):\nOkay, we'll find out. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:16:08):\nOkay. This is why I try to squeeze in seven into two and three. So if we start on product, I think it's well known, but one that I would recommend product people to read is 7 Powers by Hamilton Helmer, and Netflix has used a lot. We use a lot. It's just if you're starting out, it's great to have a strategy framework. No strategy framework is right, but having one is better than none.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:16:31):\nAnother in the space of mental models and frameworks, I think, is The Complete Investor by Charlie Munger. So, yes, it's about investment, but really it's a bunch of mental models that he uses. And I think the key takeaway is you have a problem, you should always apply three different models to it because what models do is they simplify and reduce dimensionality. The world has probably infinite dimensions and they reduces to maybe three or four. And the risk with that is you happen to get rid of a really important dimension, maybe pandemic diseases or something. But if you use three models that have different dimensions and was reduced in different ways, statistically, and it comes to the same conclusion, even the second model you apply vastly increases your chances that you're right. So that was a good book to read.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:17:24):\nThen I think if we go outside of product, I'm very interested in just science and mathematics. So a few quick ones. The Mystery of the Aleph, an amazing book. Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Helgoland by Carlo Rovelli on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Beginning of Infinity and The Fabric of Reality by David Deutch. The Case Against Reality by Donald Hoffman on the evolution versus truth and that evolution doesn't optimize for seeing the truth, just for fitness. Gödel's Proof, I think, is an amazing book on his incompleteness theorem, that in any axiomatic systems, there will be true statements that can never be proven, which is a weird thing to think about. And then maybe one of my favorites is The Demon in the Machine by Paul Davies that, I think, is lesser known on how information is really just entropy and this concept of information engines, that you can power something by just information and exhaust is also information. That was not a quick list.\n\nLenny (01:18:39):\nNo, I was just going to say you've set the record for the most number of books, but it also shows how you've become so insightful and wise just reading books like these. And so I think if people are looking to get to a place that you're at now, I think there's the lesson.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:18:55):\nI'll keep the artist much shorter, I promise.\n\nLenny (01:18:57):\nIt's all good. We got time. Okay, next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:03):\nSo we talked about Succession and it is a recent favorite. So I'll just frivolously take something that isn't recent but is an absolute favorite, which is Halt and Catch Fire, which I think is on FX. Amazing show. If you ever worked in technology, kind of starts out in the Silicon Prairie in the '80s and follows up to present day. Amazing show.\n\nLenny (01:19:24):\nHalt and Catch Fire. Yeah, I watched some of it. I actually fell off of it, but it's a good reminder to go check it out.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:29):\nGot to go back.\n\nLenny (01:19:30):\nI'm going to go back. What's a favorite recent interview question you like to ask?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:34):\nI don't ask it, but my favorite question is Lex Fridman's small ending question that is usually something like, so what's the meaning of it all? I like that. It's a tough question to get.\n\nLenny (01:19:46):\nI'm so tempted to ask you, but-\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:48):\nNo, don't.\n\nLenny (01:19:50):\nOkay. Let's move on. That'll be another ... That'll be our second take at this.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:53):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:19:55):\nWhat are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:19:58):\nThe obvious one is ChatGPT GPT-4 and just playing around with that, trying to create bots for yourself that do different things for you and so forth. But I don't think that's probably true for everyone. The other really favorite is something you've written about and talked about, which is Duolingo, which I think is both very impressive from a product point of view, the execution and what they've done. It is also insanely used in my family. We have a family account and everyone is using it and competing every day. So I'm both impressed by the product and I also use the product quite a lot.\n\nLenny (01:20:35):\nWhat languages are folks learning within your family?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:20:38):\nIn my family, it's Spanish right now.\n\nLenny (01:20:41):\nHow's it going?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:20:41):\nBien.\n\nLenny (01:20:44):\nYou get a gold star.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:20:47):\nI only have a few thousand XP. I'm not that good yet.\n\nLenny (01:20:51):\nNo, I don't know if that's good. That sounds pretty good. Next question, what's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that's had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:21:01):\nI'm not sure I've done anything minor that had a tremendous impact. Usually, it takes something bigger to get a big impact. I think maybe one thing that I've tried to do back to clarity and so forth is this thing I mentioned about I'm trying to push a lot for what I call Socratic debate, where the idea is obviously that the best idea wins, not the most senior idea and so forth. And trying to push for this notion of having people explain themselves, not saying I think there's something there or have a feeling or something like that. And apparently, as you said, that has had some impact because people apparently say that about me. So that's probably the biggest thing.\n\nLenny (01:21:53):\nFinal question, what is one fun ritual of the Spotify product team, and is it saunas?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:21:59):\nSo Spotify is so big now that it's quite local actually, different parts of Spotify, different product rituals. I accidentally created one ritual many years ago, maybe 12 years ago, when we talked about which phase a product is in. And it was ... We needed some definition. So I think off the cuff, I said, \"Well, it's four phases.\" It's think it, build it, ship it, tweak it.\" And then the think it phase, it should be cheap, not a lot of money spent. In the build it phase, you're going to start spending a lot of money. So then you must have reduced the risk in the think it phase that you're right. And then you have the ship it phase and then you go over and tweak it. And it was something that wasn't that thought through, but it's funny because I still hear it sometimes even from other companies like, \"Oh, we're in the think it phase,\" or \"We're in the tweak it phase.\" So it stuck. I don't know if it's very good, but it's stuck.\n\nLenny (01:22:57):\nIt is catchy. I think anything getting stuck in people's head is a success. Gustav, thank you so much for being here. We are two for two for Swedish people. Gustaf, with an F, Alströmer was on the podcast.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:10):\nWho is also an amazing person.\n\nLenny (01:23:12):\nAlso an amazing person. I feel very jealous of people that get to work with you and for you. Thank you again for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, maybe reach out, ask some questions.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:23):\n[inaudible 01:23:23] @GustavS.\n\nLenny (01:23:24):\nOkay. Say it again\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:28):\n@GustavS.\n\nLenny (01:23:29):\nAwesome. And then final question is just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:33):\nJust reach out. I do read feedback and I try to remove the angry comments and understand what they're actually thinking and why they're upset or what's not working.\n\nLenny (01:23:44):\nAnd then the reaching out, would you recommend an angry tweet at you or more of a email to that email address you shared?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:50):\nWell, the @GustavS is the Twitter handle, so just tweet at me.\n\nLenny (01:23:54):\nOkay.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:56):\nYou can be nice as well.\n\nLenny (01:23:57):\nOkay.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:23:57):\nIt's okay.\n\nLenny (01:23:58):\nAmazing. Gustav, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGustav Söderström (01:24:01):\nThank you for having me, Lenny. It's been a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:24:03):\nBye, everyone.\n\nLenny (01:24:05):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "我试图在内部找到方法，围绕 Spotify 建立更多文化，帮助新员工和现有员工明确我们是谁，我们犯过的错误，取得的成功，以及我们如何思考战略，特别是产品战略，因为我们在外部以技术和小队模式等这些东西而闻名，但在产品战略方面知名度不高。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:09:36):\n因为我更喜欢讲故事而不是 Google Docs,我决定做一个内部播客，我去采访了 Daniel 的直接下属。包括 CMO、CHRO 和 CFO。就问他们一堆问题。这个想法是让员工觉得他们更平易近人,因为我觉得听播客时,即使那些人完全不认识我,因为我从未见过他们,我也感觉我了解他们,我感觉我知道他们怎么思考,而且我更喜欢他们了。所以秘密想法是,如果你能比通过偶尔的会议或一些全员大会更好地了解你的领导者,会怎么样?所以我在内部做了这个,因为我是产品人,我们最终谈了很多关于产品和产品战略的内容。内部员工非常喜欢。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:10:26):\n所以下一次,问题是,如果还没有在 Spotify 工作的人也能感觉他们认识 Spotify 的人,会怎么样?那会很棒,因为大多数公司的大多数领导者都非常不透明,当你在商业报纸或其他地方看到他们时,我觉得他们看起来像某种不真实的异世界生物。那如果你听过他们讲一个小时左右会怎样?所以这就是总体想法。结合了招聘工具、分享更多我们如何思考产品战略,以及纯粹因为我觉得这很有趣。我得以采访了一大批聪明有趣的人,包括外部和内部的。\n\nLenny (00:11:09):\n回顾起来,它达到了你希望的效果吗?\n\nGustav Söderström (00:11:12):\n我认为达到了。播客做得很好,而且我们没有给它自己的推广。我必须像其他人一样竞争,这也让你对这个问题产生了很多共鸣,比如,好的,现在你有了一个产品,那用户获取怎么办?你如何真正让人们去听它?所以它确实达到了我想要的效果,就是我们有一个叫 intradays 的活动,特别是在过去几年我们招了很多人的时候,我们实际上让人们飞到 Stockholm 参加入职培训,了解 Spotify。领导层在台上,谈论他们做什么、部门和战略等等。人们经常过来告诉我,\"哦,我听了这个播客或这一集,这至少是我加入的关键原因之一,有时甚至是我加入的原因。\"所以这是轶事性的,但至少有几十个人这么说过。所以这似乎起作用了。\n\nLenny (00:12:12):\n这真的很有趣。再次,这在播客中出现过几次,就是内容在所有这些不同方面的力量,用于招聘和文化建设。听起来最初的目标只是在内部建立这种诊所文化和战略。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:12:24):\n那是最初的目标,让高层领导更平易近人,缩短距离,然后也以一种有趣的方式分享更多思考,而不仅仅是通过人们最终不会阅读的文档。\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\n我喜欢这个。所以我在听的时候,正如我所说,真正有趣的是,我认为第四集实际上全是关于 AI 的,我认为是你们在 Spotify 内部利用机器学习和 AI 的第一次尝试。我认为这导致了 Discover Weekly 和其他一些工具的诞生。那是几年前的事了。现在听它很有趣,因为 AI 又成了一个大事。所以我很好奇,在产品团队层面,你在如何思考 AI 在产品思维中的应用,以及在日常工作中的应用方面,对产品经理和产品团队有什么建议。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:13:12):\n我可以举几个例子,我不知道我们是否比其他人更成熟,但我们至少会在相当长的时间内做传统的机器学习。我想在播客中,我谈到了互联网发展的阶段。一种思考方式是,互联网始于用户策展。所以你拿一些东西,一些商品,比如人、书或音乐,你把它数字化,放到网上,然后你让用户来策展它。这就是你的 Facebook、Spotify 等等。然后过了一段时间,世界从策展转向了推荐,不再是人做那项工作,而是算法。这是一个巨大的变化,需要我们和其他人真正重新思考整个用户体验,有时也包括商业模式。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:14:04):\n我认为我们现在正在进入的是,我们正在从策展到推荐再到生成。我怀疑这将是一个同样大的转变,你最终将不得不重新思考你的产品。所以这是一个视角。所以我倾向于和我的团队谈论,尽管这都是机器学习,我要求他们把这看作完全不同的东西。推荐时代是一种机器学习。生成时代是另一种,所以不要把它看作只是更多的同样东西,而是把它看作实际上完全新的东西。我们在......嗯,有几件事。所以如果你看这个大语言模型和扩散模型等的新时代,有两种类型的应用。正如我所说的推荐时代,我们必须为推荐优先时代重新思考用户界面和体验。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:14:57):\n那么这在生成时代意味着什么?还没有人真正知道。像往常一样,有一堆迭代改进。所以我们使用这些大语言模型来改进我们的推荐。你可以有更大的向量,可以有更多的文化知识。你可以用它对还没有人听过的播客进行安全分类等等。所以有很多明显的改进,我们正在做这些。但到目前为止,我们真正只做了一个严格定义上的真正的生成产品,就是没有生成式 AI 就不可能存在的产品,那就是 AI DJ。所以这是我们思考了很长时间的一个概念。AI DJ 是你按下一个按钮,一个数字化的人,有一个真人叫 X,数字化的 X。所以他现在是一个 AI,出现并和你谈论你喜欢的音乐并推荐音乐,你可以听。如果你不喜欢,你可以再叫他回来,他会说,\"好的,现在,让我们听一些也许是几个夏天前的东西,\"或者\"这是昨天在《最后生还者》这一集中流行的一些新东西。\"\n\nGustav Söderström (00:16:10):\n所以这个产品没有生成式 AI 就不可能存在,既要生成声音,又要生成声音说的内容。所以你可以拥有针对五亿人规模的个性化语音。所以我们有这个用例,我们已经看到很多很多年了。有时人们称之为电台用例。我们在内部称之为零意图用例,当你真的完全不知道你想听什么时。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:16:40):\nSpotify 在这方面不是很好。Spotify 擅长的是,至少大致上,你知道你想做什么的用例,比如健身或晚餐。我们为所有这些都有很多选项。但如果你真的完全不知道,打开 Spotify 盯着它看会很困难。人们过去常常充满渴望地说,这是电台擅长的一件事。老实说,电台相当糟糕。我的意思是,它根本不是为你个性化的。它不是点播的。你在中途进来,实际上在很多方面都很糟糕。但人们仍然经常说它有一些好的地方。我认为那个好东西是你有一个旋钮,你可以在不同的语境之间切换。就像,不,无聊,无聊,无聊,无聊,好的,这个不错。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:17:23):\n而 Spotify 从来没有那种模式,我不知道我想要什么,但我想循环浏览各种东西,直到我找到我喜欢的东西。我认为有了 AI DJ,这实际上是我们设法解决的用例。所以 X 出现并说,\"我要向你推荐一些你可以听的东西。\"如果你喜欢,你可以继续听,但如果你不喜欢,你可以再次把他叫回来,然后换频道。出于某种原因,我们尝试解决这个问题很长时间了,但只是在没有任何背景说明为什么你会听这个的情况下开始播放一首随机歌曲,它从来没有奏效过。所以这是我们首次涉足一个以前不可能存在的产品。我认为对于你关于原则的问题,我们学到了几个非常明确的原则。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:18:09):\n我真正喜欢的一个,根本不是我的原则,我认为它直接来自 Chris Dixon,就是容错用户界面的原则。我不知道在早期机器学习时代有多少次,当我们说我们正在从策展转向推荐时,我看到一个设计草图是一个单一的大播放按钮,因为显然那是你能做的最简单的用户界面,但如果你不了解你的机器学习的性能,你就无法为它设计。你的机器学习的质量,如果你要有一个单一的播放按钮,需要达到字面意义上的 100% 或零预测错误,而这永远不会是这种情况。\n\n你需要快速地说：\"不，不，不。\"所以这方面最明显的候选就是这些信息流类型的体验，你可以浏览大量内容，你预期命中率会低得多。如果你不喜欢，成本也很低，你只需要滑动一下就行了。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:47:50):\n这就是为什么人们一直......当他们想要突破自己的品味泡泡，或者当他们进入 Spotify 想听一些全新的东西时，通常是因为他们在 TikTok、YouTube 或类似的服务上发现的，在那里他们会接触到大量新内容。所以人们一直在向我们要求这些工具，这就是我们想要解决的问题。于是我们构建了一系列功能，类似信息流的结构，你可以浏览一个新的音乐类型下的许多曲目，或者一个播客频道类型下的许多集，甚至是完整的播放列表。我们实现了这些功能，并将它们放在一个叫做子信息流(subfeeds)的东西里。所以在当前的体验中，这已经在全球推出了，如果你点击播客子信息流，你会得到一个播客单集的信息流。点击音乐子信息流，你会得到一个播放列表的信息流，你可以浏览很多播放列表。如果你不理解名字，你可以快速听听它们听起来像什么，查看几首曲目，了解这是否适合你。如果你浏览搜索和浏览页面，你可以找到全新的音乐类型，你可以快速浏览它们。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:48:59):\n所以这些功能按我们的预期在运作。人们在想找新音乐时会去使用它们。他们浏览这些内容并保存新歌曲。所以它们按我们的预期在运作。没有按预期运作的是，当用户一再向我们要求这个功能时,我们把所有这些东西整合起来放在了首页上,因为人们对发现功能的需求非常强烈,而且我们可以清楚地看到发现功能与 Spotify 的留存率等指标是如何关联的。但我们误判的,或者说失败的,或者更准确地说是了解到的关于我们自己首页的事情是,它现在的运作方式,这一点你可以从 Twitter 评论中看到,如果你去掉那些愤怒的声音,试着看看他们在说什么,他们说的其实很明确,在定量数据中也很清楚,如果你看看人们在 Spotify 首页上做什么,当前的首页,几乎 90% 是我们所说的回想(recall)。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:49:59):\n也就是说,要么是回到你已经在进行的一个会话中,要么是回到一个你知道你想去的特定播放列表,或者至少是一个特定的使用场景。所以你带着很强的意图进来,你实际上知道你想要什么,可能只有 10% 的时候是真正的发现,比如我不知道我想要什么。所以如果你想想,那就是 90% 回想和 10% 发现。当我们测试这个设计时......所以子信息流有些地方运作良好,有些地方不太好,但当我们在首页上测试其中一些时,我们把它从 90/10 切换到了 10/90。也就是 10% 回想,90% 发现。虽然人们想要发现功能,但他们可能不想要 90% 的发现,而不是 90% 的回想。所以如果你再看看 Twitter 上的评论,他们说的是:\"嘿,我找不到我的播放列表了。这些东西在哪里?\"\n\nGustav Söderström (00:50:47):\n他们并不是真的在抱怨发现功能,而是在抱怨他们不再能获得的那些东西。我们在定量数据中也能看到这一点。你可以看到流量从首页转移到搜索和资料库,这是一个明确的信号,表明人们在试图找到他们无法再找到的东西。你甚至可以看到人们试图使用这些为快速了解新事物而优化的发现工具来做回想。我知道我想要的那个健身播放列表在哪里?对于回想来说,这实际上是非常糟糕的 UI,就像一个老虎机,对吧?如果你能找到那个健身播放列表,是非常不可预测的。它是为发现新事物而优化的,不是为回想现有事物。当你做回想时,你想要密集的 UI,屏幕上有很多项目,因为你知道你在找什么。所以你不需要很多空间。当你在发现新事物时,你想要很多像素,你可能还想要声音,因为你不知道它是什么。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:51:40):\n所以我们对自己的 UI 学到的是,我认为这里可能有一点产品嫉妒,你总是会看看其他体验。如果你环顾四周,比如看看 YouTube 这样的产品,可以理解为什么会认为大多数其他产品,例如 YouTube,它们的首页就是那样的。它是一个巨大的单项发现信息流,只有新项目。人们似乎不会在 Twitter 上愤怒地发推说他们有多生气,他们说他们喜欢 YouTube,而且它是一个大产品。我认为我们发现的是,我们在首页上确实做得非常好的一件事,就是支持你同时处于多个会话中。所以你可以同时在听两个播客的中间,还有一本有声书,而且实际上我只是想去那个健身播放列表。我不记得它的名字了,但我知道它是健身相关的。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:52:31):\n我们在这部分做得确实很好。我敢说比其他体验好得多,在那些体验中你实际上必须进入某个标签页,进入资料库,然后开始浏览才能回到你之前的位置。所以这可能是路径依赖。因为我们在回想功能上做得相当好,我认为当人们不再能做回想时,他们变得相当沮丧,这是可以理解的。我们不想失去这个,因为这是我们做得好的事情之一,我们低估了它。我的结论实际上是我们在这方面比其他体验做得更好。所以我们当然想保留它。所以我们现在做的是更新我们的假设来实现同样的目标,也就是这些功能是有效的,当人们想要发现时,他们会使用它们,而且它们似乎有效,它们也可以变得更好。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:53:20):\n从机器学习的角度来看,你在这个爬坡的旅程上,但问题是,你如何确保每当人们觉得他们被困在自己的品味泡泡中时,他们明白这些功能在那里,而且很容易使用?所以现在我们有一个首页版本,我们也在测试,显然,这些功能非常容易获得但是自愿的,你仍然可以做所有的回想操作。所以从我的角度来看,这就是我们做 A/B Test 的原因,因为你想对它保持科学态度,你想尽可能多地了解你自己的产品和你的用户。现在我分享了很多学习成果。也许我们应该保留它们,但我的直觉是这会让产品变得好得多。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:54:09):\n但当我们进入这个过程时,我告诉我的团队,因为我已经做过几次了,同意签署,我认为有两种根本不同的产品开发类型。一种是设计一个新功能。这很难,但对人们来说使用是自愿的。所以你做了 AI DJ。有些人喜欢它,那很好。如果你不喜欢它,它也没有让你的体验变差。但当你重新设计时,就棘手得多,因为参与重新设计不是自愿的。所以即使对于不喜欢它的人来说也有成本。然后你有一个非常棘手的问题,就是会有两种类型的反馈。一种是你做了某件事,它是对的,但人们很沮丧,因为你改变了东西。另一种是你做了某件事,它不对,人们也很沮丧,但原因是正当的。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:55:08):\n那么你如何区分这两者呢?因为我想我向......当我们和团队讨论这个问题时,我认为可以想象的类比是你有你的桌面,你的物理桌面,你的电脑在一个地方,你的铅笔在这里,你的笔记本在那里,然后我进来把所有东西都重新排列了。而你已经花了,在我们的情况下,可能 12 年的时间使用那个设置。不管我有多少定量数据证明我的新设置更好,你都会不高兴,因为你在旧设置中很高效。而且很难区分这些。最经典的用例是 Facebook 的新闻信息流,当它变成单一信息流时,人们对此非常不满。但事实证明它解决了很多用户问题,你不必在 Facebook 上到处跑去自己收集事件。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:55:58):\n所以有一些方法可以了解你是让它变得更好了,但人们的习惯被打破了,还是它并没有变得更好。一件事是,例如,查看没有那种行为的新用户群组与所有用户群组等等。所以我们和团队一起经历了所有这些。在我们做之前,我说:\"这会很痛苦。\"可能会有很多推文,因为我们完全做对的几率非常低。出于这个原因,对团队来说并没有那么困难。确实很难......你想回应人们,但正确的做法是倾听、理解、尝试新的假设,真正弄清楚发生了什么。所以我想我现在已经做过三四次了。也许三次。一次不成功,两次成功。所以我知道我在做什么。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:56:45):\n所以这几乎就像你在惩罚自己,非常痛苦,但也是最令人兴奋的事情。我认为任何产品人都知道,最简单、最直接的做法是在你现在的位置上迭代。没有风险。你不会被解雇,没有用户会生气。但每个人也都知道,如果你最终不适应新技术、新范式等等,你就会被取代。你必须找到尝试新事物的平衡。当你在软件行业工作时,你有 A/B Test 这个工具,可以对它保持科学态度。当你做硬件时,情况更糟。如果你错了,你就错了。\n\n你无法更新。\n\nLenny (00:57:26):\n我很喜欢这个故事。非常感谢你的分享。我想对于这样一个重大发布，你其实无法提前进行 A/B Test，因为会有媒体报道。他们会说，\"天哪，看看 Spotify 在做什么。\"所以你在这方面是受限的。对吧？你没法真正提前测试这个。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:57:40):\n这件事最难的地方在于，如果你想尝试完全新的东西，MVP 需要做得非常大，所以你可以构建一个新的界面，但如果你没有为单条目信息流做算法，你就无法判断到底是想法不对，还是机器学习做得不好，对吧？是界面问题还是机器学习问题。或者你必须构建很多东西，这就会变得相当昂贵。实际上……最痛苦的地方并不真的是来自外部的反馈，而是你必须在内部承担的成本。你在真心希望自己是对的同时，承担了大量成本。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:58:15):\n在我们的案例中，主页的改动对我们来说并不是那么难做。重要的是底层假设——我们能否帮助你突破你的品味泡泡——这个假设是否真的有效，然后你再把获客漏斗更新到那个体验中。但我认为问题在于，你需要把这么多东西都准备好，才能说，\"你可能会得到假阴性结果\"，只是因为你没做好而已。我认为这是最大的挑战，在这些大型重构中，每个人都必须更新所有东西，然后你才能知道自己是对还是错。\n\nLenny (00:58:52):\n帮助你理解什么不起作用、什么起作用以及你想改变什么，这个过程是什么样的？我想你会看一些数据，一些推文之类的。在战术层面上，\"哦，糟糕，有些事情没有按我们预期的方向发展，这是我们应该做的\"——这是怎么做的？\n\nGustav Söderström (00:59:08):\n嗯，信息流我们做了测试，但主页信息流，我们是先发布然后再测试。我们在用户身上测试了几个不同的变体。然后我们拿到数据，更多地看定量数据。我们做了很多用户研究，让人们坐下来使用这些信息流，以理解并建立我们自己的心智模型，了解什么有效、什么无效。然后，显然你也要看用户反馈，当然，有些用户非常擅长表达哪里不起作用，其他人就不那么擅长表达哪里不起作用。所以这可能很难解析，但当然，这也是一个因素。\n\nGustav Söderström (00:59:49):\n然后一旦你做了这些，你就有定量数据可以看。然后你坐下来仔细思考，你认为什么是对的、什么是错的？有哪些不同的假设？什么有效，什么无效？然后就是不断更新和测试，直到你证明或推翻你的假设。尽可能科学地对待它。而且我认为最大的风险是，当你在某件事上投入了太多时间时，就会变得敝帚自珍。你必须毫不留情。你必须 100% 相信某些事情，直到数据说不，然后你再 100% 相信别的东西。这听起来很简单，但做起来非常难，以至于当你这样做时人们会不高兴，因为出于某种原因，人们不喜欢别人改变主意。这是我们应该希望每个人做的。我会喜欢一个说\"我看了数据，意识到实际上这是对的，现在我相信这个\"的政治家。但我们讨厌这样做的政治家。他们感觉不值得信任，我们会嘲笑他们。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:00:56):\n所以我认为对任何人来说，最大的风险就是这个。你必须不带感情色彩，只看证据和数据。如果你这样做，你就继续前进，然后到达你想去的地方，你解决同样的问题，但你会适应。\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\n我真的很喜欢这个理念。本质上，就是强观点，弱执着。是这样吗——\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:19):\n完全正确。就是这样。听起来很简单，但很难做到。\n\nLenny (01:01:23):\n对吧？因为就像你说的，人们不尊重改变主意的人。他们会说，\"哦，我明白了，他们一直都是错的，而且还对错误的东西如此自信。\"\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:31):\n是的，完全正确。不清楚为什么会这样，这应该是我们想要的，但我认为这跟人类心理学有关。我们实际上倾向于喜欢先知和那些用很少数据就持有非常强烈观点的人。这些是我们喜欢的人。那些会看大量数据的人，实际上我们不喜欢。不确定为什么。\n\nLenny (01:01:57):\n我们是有缺陷的生物。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:01:59):\n确实如此。\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\n沿着这些思路，你最近有没有改变主意的事情，也许能想到的，比如\"哦，是的\"？\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:06):\n没有，我认为关于科学系统和主页确实做得很好，也许比其他方面做得更好，我们不想把婴儿和洗澡水一起倒掉，或者那个成语怎么说的。我认为这是我目前最大的收获，我对此其实非常高兴。\n\nLenny (01:02:26):\n是的，我喜欢这个发现——我们在某些方面做得非常好，但我们不一定意识到，也许我们应该更多地倾向于那个方向。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:34):\n完全正确。\n\nLenny (01:02:35):\n换个有点不同的方向。Shishir Mehrotra 建议我问你一些事情。我想他在你的董事会，对吧。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:41):\n是的。\n\nLenny (01:02:41):\n他建议问你关于你的 10% 规划时间。那是什么？\n\nGustav Söderström (01:02:46):\n这是一个概念，我认为 Shishir 从他在 YouTube 工作以来就一直在使用。这个想法是，大致上，你用于规划的时间不应该超过执行或构建时间的 10%，这意味着如果你按季度工作，10 周的话，你应该花一周时间规划，因为我们按六个月周期工作。所以我们试图花两周时间规划，大致上还算成功。这个……实际上，当我们谈论组织模型时，要向 Airbnb 的 Brian Chesky 致敬，我认为他是最早采用这些更反传统的组织模型的人之一。他比硅谷大多数人更像苹果。他也按六个月周期工作。他在这方面也有很多经验。所以这就是 10% 规划时间的含义。我认为如果你发现自己规划的时间远超这个比例，要么你规划得太多了,要么你的执行周期相对于规划量来说太短了。这是一个经验法则，但我发现它确实有用。\n\nLenny (01:03:53):\n我问了几个 PM 我应该问你什么，实际上是在 Spotify 工作的 PM，我没有告诉你。有人指出你总是给房间带来很多能量和清晰度。这是他们认为你真正擅长的。作为一个领导者,你对这一点的重要性或者如何做好这一点有什么心得?\n\nGustav Söderström (01:04:11):\n嗯,很高兴听到这个。我不知道,所以我在想该怎么回答。我认为能量方面,我不知道。我想我只是对我做的事情感到兴奋。我一直对技术感到兴奋。我喜欢看到新事物。我的核心驱动力仍然是这个概念——你看到一些还不存在的东西,我想你会有共鸣的。然后你会想,\"哇,我想知道那能不能存在。那会太酷了。\"然后为了让人们去做它,你试图分享那种兴奋感。所以我认为我无法为我不兴奋的事情带来很多能量。所以我必须做我真正相信和感到兴奋的事情。所以也许能量就更自然地来了。幸运的是,对我来说,到目前为止,Spotify 一直处于这样一个阶段,允许很多创新,我甚至被要求尝试做新的酷事情。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:05:09):\n也许我在纯优化阶段会缺少能量。关于清晰度,我一直喜欢尝试解释事物。众所周知的一个事实是,理解某事的最好方法就是试着向别人解释它。所以我到处向没有问我的人解释事情,不是为了显得聪明,而是为了看看我是否真的理解了它。所以也许就是这种练习。在这一点上,我确实要求为我工作的领导者们,我要求他们让他们的领导者总是解释自己。我认为当……我们谈了一点关于自主权之类的,我们不承诺每个人都必须同意,但我认为我们应该向所有员工做出的承诺是,即使他们不同意,他们也有权理解你为什么做这个决定。\n\nGustav Söderström (01:06:06):\n我认为不可接受的是说,\"不,我们要这样做,因为我更资深。我见过很多次这种情况。你不够聪明。\"所有这些。我认为你必须解释自己,所以你欠一个解释。我发现这很有价值,回到理解某事的唯一方法就是解释它,因为通常会发现,如果你自己无法解释它,你可能自己也不真正理解它。有时我认为有可能你有好的产品直觉但无法表达出来。但大多数时候,当人们说有些东西在那里但他们无法解释时,他们实际上自己也不理解它。很多时候,那里实际上什么都没有。而且如果你作为产品人能够解释它,那么这个知识现在就被分享了。所以这对组织来说就变得更有效率了。所以有时我试图稍微挑衅一下人们,说……当人们问有多少是艺术,多少是科学时,我说,\"0% 是艺术,0% 是魔法,100% 是科学。\"这是因为我想强迫人们尝试解释它。我认为我们使用\"艺术\"和\"魔法\"这些词。",
