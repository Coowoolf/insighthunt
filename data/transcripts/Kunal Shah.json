(00:00:08):\nA lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the “dharma” of the founders quite well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:13):\n“These are the principles that were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:16):\nI want to keep talking about India and how it's different and how to build products that are successful in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:21):\nNo Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:24):\nThe concept of time is not the same.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:27):\nWhat do you see as the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:30):\nIndia is changing because now, for the first time, we are seeing founders being respected and unicorns being celebrated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:36):\nWe have a National Startup Day, and probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:42):\nI wouldn't want to be anywhere else building.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:48):\nToday my guest is Kunal Shah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:51):\nKunal is one of the most well-known and respected entrepreneurs and product leaders in India and around the world.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:58):\nHe shares endless wisdom on Twitter and LinkedIn where he has over 1 million followers.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:03):\nHe's the CEO and founder of CRED, a FinTech startup based in India, which was last valued at over $6 billion and as of couple years ago processed over 20% of all credit card bill payments in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:16):\nPrior to CRED, he founded three other startups including Freecharge, which he sold for over $400 million to Snapdeal.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:23):\nKunal is a deep thinker, both about product and about life.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:27):\nHis background is actually in philosophy, which comes across very clearly when you hear him share his advice.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:34):\nIn our conversation, we get deep into what makes working and building in India different from the US markets and other markets, including why trust is so essential and why so many people are so much more risk-averse in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:46):\nWe talk about the biggest challenges and opportunities within the India market, why there are so many successful Indian immigrants in CEO roles across tech, and what we can learn from that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:56):\nAlso, why companies in India can quickly grow DAUs but not ARPUs, and what that means for building products in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:03):\nWe also talk about how to stay curious and open-minded and the power of second order thinking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:07):\nAlso, stories of failure, lots of contrarian takes and so much more.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:13):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast on your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:18):\nIt's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:23):\nA big thank you to Cyan, my ET, for making the connection to Kunal.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:27):\nWith that, I bring you Kunal Shah after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:36):\nIf you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:45):\nThat's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:51):\nTheir APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features, and hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:03):\nWorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:09):\nIt's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:15):\nAuthKit's designed is stunning out of the box and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:21):\nIt's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:26):\nBest of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:31):\nCheck it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:35):\nThat's workos.com/lenny.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Orb.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:42):\nAs a business, you care about revenue, but as a product team, the last thing you want to do is delay a product launch or a pricing change because your team has to rebuild billing from scratch.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:52):\nOrb is a flexible usage based billing engine that lets you evolve your pricing with ease.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:57):\nThe fastest growing product teams at companies like Vercel and Replit trust Orb to power their pricing changes and launches.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:04):\nUse Orb to ship product faster, stop worrying about billing, and evolve pricing with ease and control.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:11):\nCheck it out at withorb.com/lenny.\n\nLENNY

the podcast.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:29):\nLenny, thank you so much for having me, and a huge fan of everything that you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:35):\nAnd like I said before, India is a huge beneficiary of what you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:40):\nWe are all people who have learned the art of product by just figuring it out, and watching some content here and there and reading some stuff.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:49):\nSo kudos to everything that you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:51):\nAnd like I said earlier, you do a fabulous job of taking the information asymmetry of the art of product and  making it accessible to many of us across the world.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:02):\nSo thank you.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:03):\nWow, I really appreciate that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:04):\nThis is already feeling great to me.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:06):\nI have a huge.. so it turns out this podcast has a huge audience in India, as do you.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:12):\nAnd so I feel like this conversation is going to be really special and really meaningful to a lot of people.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:18):\nI wanted to start with something very tactical.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:21):\nThere's a product framework that you came up with that I absolutely love, and I've shared it with at least 30 founders over the last couple years. And this is actually how I discovered you initially; I heard about this thing, and I'm like, who's this guy Kunal Shah?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:34):\nAnd look at us now, chatting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:36):\nCould you explain this framework briefly and then just how you've used it or how you recommend people apply it?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:43):\nOh, and by the way, it's called Delta 4.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:44):\nI don't know if I even said the name.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:46):\nYeah, it's called the Delta 4 framework, but I think it's actually quite simple.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:51):\nIf you think about it, a lot of people say that your product has to be 10x better and it's not very measurable.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:57):\nYou don't know if you are 10x better or not unless you're delusional.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:01):\nAnd the trigger for me was actually, I'm the unusual tech founder in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:06):\nI'm the only humanities/philosophy major founder in India who's got into tech.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:12):\nAnd I often wondered if most people who were my peers, or people who were ahead of me, were significantly smarter academically or otherwise.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:21):\nAnd why did I become successful with my first startup, Freecharge, which I exited in 2015 for nearly $450 million?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:28):\nAnd I was like, “What would make this happen?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:31):\nBecause I would not qualify into this super league of really top IIT rankers that exist in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:38):\nAnd that got me onto this philosophical quest to find out what makes things successful.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:43):\nSo the simple framework is, an example I give often is that, imagine the old way of taking a cab ride and an Uber. And if I asked you to give me the score of efficiency on Uber and let's say getting the old cab, what would you say, Lenny?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:58):\nI'm curious.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:59):\nOut of 10?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:00):\nYeah, give a cab three and then Uber like a nine.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:04):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:05):\nSo every time you see that the product efficiency delta is greater than or equal to four, three things happen.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:14):\nIt is irreversible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:16):\nSecond is that you have a very high tolerance for it to fail.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:21):\nIf Uber fails a little bit, will you say, “Oh my God, I'm going to really stop using it?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:30):\nNo.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:31):\nAnd the third thing is what I call the UBP, ‘Unique Brag-worthy Proposition.’\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:37):\nEvery time humans unlock a Delta 4 product or service, they cannot stop talking or sharing about it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:46):\nAnd therefore all Delta 4 products will naturally have lower CAC or sometimes zero CAC because people, humans.. and think about it, Lenny, how you discovered Google, definitely not through an ad, definitely not through some performance marketing here and there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:57):\nSomebody showed you the demo and you were like, “Oh my God, this is crazy.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:01):\nAnd that's what I'm seeing right now, what's happening with everything on OpenAI and everything that is happening around LLM feels like magic and it's Delta 4 because the efficiency of doing things before and after is now showing that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:12):\nBut failure is the real problem.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:15):\nAnd making everything tech does not make things more efficient.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:19):\nLet's take an example.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:21):\nBuying a suit for yourself online versus offline, all tech, cool stuff, all the features built in.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:30):\nWhat would you say the efficiency of buying a suit online is versus, let's say, buying a suit offline?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:35):\nI've actually done that and it was a terrible fit. It did not fit at all.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:39):\nAnd so it's efficient, but the end result was not, it's probably often not great.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:45):\nSo it's probably-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:46):\nOverall efficiency score, what would you give?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:48):\nOf buying a suit online?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:50):\nYeah, versus offline.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:53):\nI'd probably give it five and five.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:56):\nOffline is actually probably a better experience.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:58):\nI give it a seven.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:59):\nThat's crazy because you've broken the principle, this is a tech product, but the efficiency is better offline.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:06):\nAnd therefore when the delta is less than four, what you will discover is that it is reversible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:15):\nYou will not see people bragging about it and you have zero tolerance for it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:21):\nSo you're never going to buy a suit online. I can tell you that right now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:25):\nSo I think it's a simple framework.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:28):\nI believe that if many companies applied..  I know now many VCs in the US use this as part of the training program for analysts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:36):\nomebody in Sequoia mentioned this to me that they have this as part of the thing, but in India we are not still applying many of these things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:46):\nI think it's a simple framework to at least know. You can apply this to features, you can apply this to products, you can apply that to business.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:55):\nAnd oftentimes this is a longer concept.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:57):\nWe can talk about it in many ways because it's derived out of some study around entropy and evolutionary biology, which is the root of how I discovered and thought about Delta 4, that “When does a species get disrupted ” or “what is entropy and why does low entropy require growth of high entropy?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:18):\nIt's a day long podcast on its own.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:19):\nSo some other time.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\nWe'll save that for a future follow-up, just diving in on the psychology of Delta 4. Just to kind of summarize this, because I think it's such a powerful framework and I find it useful to convince founders why their product isn't taking off.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:32):\nThey may feel like this is better than. The classic example, is a better Excel.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:36):\nLook, this is so much better than Excel.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:38):\nIt can do all these things.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:39):\nYou don't have to learn all these formulas.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:41):\nBut the trick here that I love is just what people rate the existing solution 1to 10, what would they rate your solution 1 to 10?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:48):\nIt has to be four points higher, otherwise no one's going to pay attention.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:52):\nAnd I think it's pretty simple.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:53):\nPeople are busy, they have enough things to do, they have enough products and apps, they're not going to take the time to really dig into something if it's not that much better.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:00):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\nI'm going to go in a totally different direction.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:03):\nI want to talk about Indian CEOs in the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:06):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:07):\nSo today the CEOs of Microsoft, Alphabet, Adobe, which is a $250 billion company it turns out, IBM, which is a $170 billion company, Palo Alto Networks, which is a $100 billion company, even Starbucks, also a $100 billion company, I was looking that up.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:25):\nAnd then also Twitter before Elon took over Twitter. The CEOs of these companies were all born in India and immigrated to the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:32):\nAnd I might be wrong, but I think this is the largest ethnic group of CEOs of tech companies other than just white dudes in the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\nSo I'm curious why you think Indian immigrants are so successful in business and in tech in the US, especially in these very high positions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:50):\nAnd I'm most curious, just what can we learn from that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:53):\nWhat can we learn from their success?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:55):\nIt's a great question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:56):\nI often wonder about it and I have had the good fortune to meet a fair bunch of these individuals, and had a chance to really explore with them what really went on.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:07):\nSo there are a few things that pop out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:10):\nAnd again, these are all conjectures, which I can't prove in any way, but it's a thought experiment to talk about these things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:18):\nFirst is in general, immigrants that get out of the country usually have a chip on their shoulder in a very different way.  And the struggle that they have to go through to just get out and be successful, and that hunger that got them there. There was no privilege.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:37):\nThey came from very, very humble backgrounds and literally no money to start with.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:42):\nSo I think that this force is real.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:46):\nYou can say that for many immigrants in general as well. But appreciation for math in general, or logic which came to society in a big way, kind of gave. Let's say for example, lots of engineering graduates come from only a few countries because society was bent towards early exposure to mathematics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:04):\nAnd I think that kind of helps create status that will get appreciated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:10):\nFor example, being an engineer, a doctor...  As a philosophy major, I was a write-off for society.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:16):\nSo the reason I'm the rare commodity over here, because you are not considered to be very bright unless you break into these very hard exams and do very, very hard things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:25):\nSo the filtering criteria on its own is big.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:28):\nBut there's another interesting framework altogether, which I have actually learned from this gentleman, Devdutt Patnaik. He applies Indian mythology and management principles together.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:39):\nAnd it's an interesting thing. There are three major Indian Gods.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:43):\nOne is Brahma, the God of creation, Shiva the God of destruction.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:49):\nI'm  generalizing here, but that's the classification.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:52):\nAnd the third is Vishnu, the God of sustenance.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:55):\nAnd their avatars-the word “avatar” comes from Vishnu who keeps changing avatars.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:59):\nSo we have Rama, Krishna, all these Gods are avatars of his.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:04):\nSo what you notice is that if you take a two by two of people who are high on values and low on values, are high on obedience and low on obedience, you make an interesting two by two.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:19):\nNow, Lord Krishna, who is one of the very popular avatars, which suits the entrepreneurial category,  is high on values but very low on obedience. He was known to be the naughty God and he could actually create lots of things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:36):\nAnd there is Rama, who is known to be the one who follows principles and is obedient.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:41):\nSo they will follow ‘dharma’ and scale on that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:45):\nAnd then there are these notorious characters, there is Ravana who is low on values, low on obedience, and there is Duryodhana which he says that he is high on obedience but low on values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:55):\nSo these are the people that you don't want to be.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:57):\nAnd what you notice is that a lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the ‘dharma’ of the founders quite well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:05):\nThey have not diluted the dharma of the founders who have started these companies, and managed to sustain that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:13):\nAnd a lot of CEOs have this need to say, \"Oh, I'm going to change the company forever and it'll be my identity and I will change the logo and I'll change the name and I will do all sorts of things.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:25):\nBut maintaining ‘dharma’, where I will say that “These principles were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger,\" comes from the humility of saying that there is something that was built with some pure form factor, and I think therefore that character stays on.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:41):\nAnd therefore we have the characters of Brahma and Shiva, the founder and destroyer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:47):\nThat's the thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:48):\nBut sustenance is the harder one.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:51):\nAnd therefore our avatars keep happening over time and different hurdles come and then different levels come.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:57):\nBut when you think about the archetype of, at least the Indian CEOs, I've seen that they are fabulous at moving between Krishna and Rama all the time.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:07):\nThey can play this consistently, and therefore they keep evolving and keep making these companies bigger and bigger.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:14):\nAnd I think we'll see a lot more of this in years to come, because now they have the role models of these individuals who have done well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:22):\nBut the key principle is that if you ask the founders, they will love these CEOs if they're around because they maintain the dharma.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:32):\nFor example, what Tim is doing is maintaining the dharma of Steve Jobs because if he had tried to change the dharma of Steve Jobs and the values of the company, it's very hard to imagine it sustaining itself forever.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:45):\nWow, what an answer.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:47):\nWhat I love about this is this combination of using a two by two and Indian mythology. It is like the microcosm of you, which is philosophy and tech.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:58):\nAnd so I love that and it makes a lot of sense that that's where your mind goes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:02):\nSomething else this makes me think about is, I read this book a long time ago, Jim Collins ‘Good to Great’ or one of his early books about leadership, and he talks about level five leadership I think. Here level five leaders are ones where it's not about them, it's about the business and they can disappear in the future and things will work great.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:19):\nYes.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:20):\nAnd I feel it is very hard if you believe that your identity needs to have its own position and legacy, and therefore a lot of time chasing status causes disruption because you will say that “Oh, this doesn't have my signature in it.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:37):\nAnd therefore accepting the religion and trying to be the Pope of it or the father of it is better than trying to say, \"Oh, I need to have my variant of religion.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:50):\nAnd that's where the creative destruction starts happening.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:54):\nInteresting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\nSo you said that there's this good balance between Krishna and Rama that happens.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:59):\nCan you just summarize where they are in that two by two?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:02):\nRama is high on values and high on obedience, and Krishna is high on values and low on obedience, but they both are high on values, which means they'll follow dharma, and they'll change sides.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:17):\nFor example, let's say Satya during the OpenAI crisis played Krishna and got things out, but he'll switch back to being Rama and continue to keep scaling it up.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\nAnd just to close the loop on here, is your sense that they're actually thinking about this and they're religious, or is this just in the ether of growing up in India and this is just part of the culture?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\nIt's a great question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\nI don't think they consciously think about it, but I think if they ever heard this, they would agree with it, because that's what they grew up with and value systems are much more long-term.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:51):\nFor example, I believe all bad behavior in humans comes from being short-term, and being long-term is a big choice to make.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:04):\nAnd a lot of times a lot of people argue that we have a 95% arranged marriages and less than 1% divorce rate, comes from this whole long-term thinking that people are married through values versus attraction or lust and all of that stuff. They’re more long-term oriented and about building a family, building values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:31):\nOr low divorce rate is about “we'll fix along the way” versus trying to say “I need to evolve” and “I need to move forward.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:38):\nSo I think being long-term about that mindset, and that's why some cultures last for thousands of years, because of this need for everybody to be more long-term versus short.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:52):\nThe US could use a lot of that these days.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:55):\nYou mentioned this interesting fact about how in India, most startups fail. You said, I think, the classic stat is 90%, and that the risk is a lot higher to start a company and then fail.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:08):\nCan you just talk about what impact that has?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:11):\nHow do people try to avoid that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:12):\nBecause that'd be amazing if you can reduce the risk of starting a company or is it just that it happens and people get super in debt?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:20):\nI think long-term societies are naturally more risk-averse. And not all great CEOs can become great founders for the same reason.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:32):\nIn fact, I would say that it actually makes it very hard to be a founder if you've been a great CEO because you've turned into this sustainer versus destroyer or creator.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:45):\nThe nuance I'm talking about is when you are thinking about risk appetite, India is changing, but now for the first time we are seeing founders being respected and talked about and these unicorns being celebrated and our Prime Minister talks about startups quite openly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:02):\nWe have a National Startup Day and so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:04):\nSo I think there is a thing that has changed this, but let's understand the core human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:11):\nIndia still has a large number of arranged marriages.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:16):\nAnd if you are a founder and a failed founder, your chances of getting a person to marry is still hard to achieve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:26):\nSo if this is all true, then the appetite to take risk will be curtailed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:32):\nSomebody gave me an interesting example that there's a very large, let's say CPG company in India, and let's say you do a zero to one over there and the CEO changes in four or five years and your zero to one fails, but you were the best person, that's why you were given the zero to one.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:49):\nThe next CEO is like, “So what have you done in the last five years?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:52):\nHe's like, \"Nothing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:53):\nI just tried to launch it but failed.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:55):\nAnd you are neither given a promotion in the company, nor a new company will say, \"Oh my God, I'm going to hire this talent.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:00):\nSo the guy who stayed on this stable brand within the CPG company kept growing, but that has natural tailwinds.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:07):\nAll he has to do is nothing in that brand.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:10):\nAnd then suddenly what you see is that he or she's managed to do well and this guy has done a zero to one has not done well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:16):\nSo we do not celebrate risk-takers as a country yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:21):\nAnd I think we'll change that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:23):\nI think it's changing already, but we have a long way to go.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:27):\nOne of the beautiful things I often talk about is that when I was in Portugal once and I saw, I don't know if you've ever been and seen this, but in the church normallyonly the Royalty are allowed to be buried or cremated. There is only one more category that is allowed-  the explorers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:47):\nVasco da Gama, all of these guys who explored the world and took risks and took the country forward, were given the same position as the royalty.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:55):\nSo when we give the highest status to risk-takers, the country appreciates it because ultimately we're all looking for markers of social validation.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:05):\nSuper interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:06):\nI want to keep talking about India and how it's different and especially what may surprise people about the market, both building there and then how to build products that are successful in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:15):\nI saw in a different interview, you talk about how there's this big difference between DAUs and ARPUs. In India it's really easy to get DAUs, basically get lots of users, it's really hard to make revenue per user, and that changes the way you build products broadly.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:30):\nCould you just talk about why this is the case?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:32):\nWhy is it so much easier to get DAUs versus ARPUs?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:37):\nI think ARPU is a function of per capita income of a country.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:41):\nYou cannot make $100 per user from a country for a product when their income is let's say $2,500 per year as an average for the whole country.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:52):\nSo what happens is many global companies love to come to India because we have the cheapest data, and very high smartphone penetration.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:01):\nSo if you look at a lot of global giants, they'll have 500 million users from India, sometimes a billion users coming from Asia and they don't have huge ARPUs, but they help you show the user growth which helps you in your public market and therefore improves your valuations.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:16):\nFor example, my guess is that, I don't know if this data is public or not to talk about, my guess is that Meta would not have more than $3 or $4 per user per year monetization in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:28):\nBut if you look at the user growth in India, it is huge.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:33):\nSo a lot of times for global companies, India becomes a great MAU farm but very low on ARPU. Therefore a lot of Indian founders who tried to copy the Western market saying, “I'm going to have a few hundred million users” make a terrible mistake because they will need to then go abroad to find their ARPUs to balance the act.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:24:52):\nYou talk about how Netflix is a good example of that, where they launched in India, they got lots of users, but just couldn't make a lot of money.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):\nBecause forusers to find relevant content, pay for content, when we have tons of free data, tons of free content all over the place, like short videos that are competing with time, so much going on over here, people actually paying for that by design is going to be less.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:17):\nAnd I'm not saying that it'll not change in 10, 20 years, but the expectation that many global companies come over here saying that, “I'm going to have these tens of millions of users who start paying me as soon as I come”, for Spotify, for Netflix, or Amazon Prime for that matter has not panned out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:25:37):\nSo one of my takeaways here is just when you look at a startup as an investor especially, and you see “We've got 100 million users,” don't treat that the same as say 100 million users in the US or other markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:49):\nAbsolutely.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:50):\nOne more thing is the value of time as a concept.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:53):\nSo one of the things you'll notice, Lenny, is that no Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:00):\nBut let me ask you a question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:01):\nWhat was your first ever job and how were you paid?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:04):\nMy first ever job, I was tutoring women about computers and passing Microsoft certification tests.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:10):\nAnd I was paid, I'm pretty sure it was hourly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:10):\nNow most likely you'll remember what the hour rate income was.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:16):\nAnd even though you've started making a lot more, you still have the concept of what the value of your one hour is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:23):\nBut if you ask most Indians, and if you ever come to India and do this exercise when you meet them, ask them “What's your income per day or income per hour?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:34):\nNobody will be able to answer, no matter what their job is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:36):\nThey could be staff, at the restaurant, to somebody who's doing really basic work, to anybody in any fancy job, because we've never ever been paid an hourly salary.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:47):\nSo when you're not paid an hourly salary, the concept of time is not the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:53):\nAnd when the concept of time is not the same, paying for time is hard to do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:59):\nAnd therefore you'll see a lot of Indians who make, let's say, I don't know, maybe $100 an hour, but still spend an hour to spend $10 on a flight ticket because that's what it is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:10):\nAnd if you discuss that with many of the Indians in the West also you'll realize that this is a common joke that they will still fight for the $10 because the value of time is something that is harder to get used to unless from your childhood the unit of time was moved smaller and smaller.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:29):\nThat is really interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:31):\nAnd you're saying that comes from just the fact that people never get paid hourly?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:34):\nIt's always a salary, and so people don't write down-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:36):\nThe concept of valuing time.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:40):\nMany Indian languages do not have a word for “efficiency.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:44):\nWow.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:45):\nAnd that's true for many Asian languages, the word for “efficiency” does not exist.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:50):\nSo then how do you value it if it's not in the vocabulary?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:54):\nFascinating.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:56):\nThere's something else along these lines of DAUs and ARPUs and efficiency that you talked about that I love, which is this idea that focus is a curse in Asian markets, that in the US there's often this advice.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:09):\n“Focus, build one thing that's amazing that everyone loves, try to make that work, scale that, and then, only then, build a new product or build something, build a new big feature.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:18):\nAnd your advice is in India and Asian markets in general, it's the opposite.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:22):\nAnd I think it's because you make so little per user.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:24):\nCould you talk about that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:25):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:26):\nI think one is you make very little per user, so you have to do many things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:30):\nBut also all low trust markets, and let me define low trust markets as where consumers are a lot more wary of trying new things because there are no institutions that protect you against bad behavior done by a company.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:44):\nSo for example, if I ever had a fall in a coffee shop in the US, I can think about suing them and making money off it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:51):\nIn India, you're only worried about “I'm going to pay for my thing.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:53):\nYou don't even think about suing the coffee shop or even hoping that you'll get any money for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:57):\nSo what happens is in a low trust country, and all developing nations are low trust by design, because the institutions are not strong enough to really, really take care of many things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:09):\nWhat happens is there is concentration of trust.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:11):\nSo you will see that super apps, superstars, super companies all exist in low trust markets because the lack of trust creates concentration of trust, and therefore you will see one app can do 400 things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:24):\nFor example, we have a company like Tata that can do salt to car to jewelry to anything and people will buy it because it's a Tata brand, because it comes from a low trust society trusting the brand and not being, “Oh, I'm going to prefer this new brand.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:42):\nThe joy of trying new things is not so high in low trust nations.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:47):\nWow, I'm learning a lot here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:48):\nI didn't know all this.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:49):\nSo essentially the brand is even more, exponentially more important in Indian markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:55):\nIt's funny, but the oldest brand in the world is a brand called Chyavanprash.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:00):\nIt's a guy named Chavan who built a “prash” which is a sort of paste that you can have for good health, and it was built in India many, many, many, many centuries ago.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:14):\nAnd lots of Indian businesses still have the name of the person behind it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:19):\nEven the US is like that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:21):\nJP Morgan, all these guys are not some fancy name.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:23):\nThey're the names of people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:25):\nAnd therefore in India, trust still comes from a lot of names of people who had a lot of trust behind them and reputation behind them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:33):\nI want to zoom out a little bit before we go in a different direction.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:36):\nWhat do you see as either the most pressing challenges in India right now for tech and/or the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:47):\nAnd then just generally where do you think things will evolve in the next few years?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:51):\nSometimes I wonder if the challenges and the opportunities are exactly the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:56):\nFor example, one of the biggest challenges we have is, we have very low female participation of labor compared to many markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:04):\nBut I also believe it's an opportunity because you can, let's say, use AI and create many new types of business and opportunities because now work from home is not an alien concept anymore.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:13):\nYou can actually create very interesting businesses for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:16):\nNumber two is we are low on per capita income.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:23):\nSo what AI can do instead of taking our jobs away, is just make us brighter.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:28):\nSatya talks about how expertise is now available in the air. So you can actually just ride on that and really make the world very equal in many many ways.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:40):\nSo that's a massive opportunity and also a challenge, because I often make this joke that the largest employer of the world is ‘inefficiency’, and if you take that away too quickly, we'll have a very, very jobless world.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:52):\nSo the thing is that it can be an opportunity for a country like India and also potentially a threat because if we don't start becoming great at AI.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:01):\nI was actually just telling somebody today that maybe all of our interviews should be about giving a task that they can only perform if they are very good at AI.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:11):\nAnd no matter what the job is, you make that the minimum criteria that if they cannot use that, leverage that, they'll become a liability in 5 years anyways.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:23):\nAnd the last one is, we have a very young demographic, very well positioned with access to technology, access to smartphones and so on and so forth, a lot of hunger.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:34):\nBut our challenge is that it's also the first generation that is truly learning what entrepreneurship is, what risk is, and we'll make all sorts of mistakes to get there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:43):\nAnd I hope we don't go into a shell after having these large scale failures that we have not seen before.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:50):\nIndia is not used to layoffs.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:53):\nLike the startup world is used to layoffs, but in India, if startups do layoffs, it becomes the national news and all sorts of discussions happen over here.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:01):\nSo we are not there yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:03):\nSo we are stuck between being somewhat of a collectivist or somewhat of an individualistic society.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:10):\nWe are somewhere.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:12):\nIndia is a great remix of everything.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:15):\nI love this line you just shared of “inefficiencies is the largest employer in the world”.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:22):\nI totally get that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:23):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:24):\nSo let's talk about CRED for a bit.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:27):\nSo you had, I think three startups before CRED?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):\nAnd then you've been building CRED for about six years now.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:34):\nI'm curious just on this journey of CRED, what you've learned or changed your mind about, during this phase of your career versus previous phases.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:45):\nI think CRED's insight was actually quite simple.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:47):\nWe realized that unfortunately the value of time and per capita income is concentrated with 25 million families and therefore focusing on them is important.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:56):\nAnd they are a lot more global in their approach versus the rest of India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:01):\nSo you have to build for them very differently.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:05):\nAnd I realized that the ability to focus on a customer set, which is not historically possible to do because every investor expected us to be the next China, and the only similarity of India and China was the population and nothing else was similar.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:19):\nSo I think having that conviction that, “I'm going to build only for these folks and this large enough market.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:27):\nThankfully I had one success for somebody to bet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:30):\nSo our series A was $25 million.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:32):\nI would've not had that luxury if I had no success in the past because I had no product with any monetization to prove that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:39):\nIt turned out okay, but I think I could get a lot of people to take a risk behind my insight or my thesis because I focused on the right customer category and built on it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:51):\nBut I think the few things I've learned differently is that companies that are very, very good at zero to one will not naturally become great at 10 to 100.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:00):\nThere are lots of different lessons to learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:01):\nThe founder has to evolve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:03):\nThat’s the biggest thing that has to happen.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:05):\nMost people at CRED are people who have not seen a bigger business than CRED, which comes with its benefits and costs.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:12):\nSo you have to gentrify the org every now and then to make people understand the value of many of these reliable things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:19):\nAnd I often tell people that entrepreneurs are uncertainty absorbers for everybody- for employees, for investors, for customers- and therefore they get rewarded for being those people who remove uncertainty from people's lives.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:37):\nBut the kind of expectations keep changing at companies of scale.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:41):\nFor example, if you have, let's say a seed stage investor, they are very used to very high uncertainty and they're happy with some absorption.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:51):\nBut as you get a growth investor, and let's say you have sovereigns on your cap table, the amount of stability you need to provide is significantly more, and therefore you need to evolve very, very differently.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:01):\nSo I think those are the few lessons that I've learned.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:02):\nTalent, you start realizing that not everybody can scale into everything.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:07):\nAnd you cannot expect that you can give up the 0 to 1 DNA just because you're building 10 to 100.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:12):\nSo how do you kind of coexist with those things?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:15):\nHow do you react to big changes in the market and not become this slow company?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:19):\nAnd every company goes through that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:21):\nI mean if you look at what Zuck went through in the last three or four years was that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:27):\nI often say that he had to play the Shiva, come and do a lot of destruction to become big again.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:34):\nSo I think that's what founders can do, and it's not easy to do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:39):\nOne of the things I've learned is that profit pools of a country tell you a lot about what the country values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:48):\nAnd trying to copy somebody else's profit pool to your country will not be a wise idea because the country's values are demonstrated in what profit pools exist.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:57):\nLet's take an example.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:59):\nIn the thousand most profitable companies in India, the number of retailers would be probably two or three.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:06):\nBut if you look at the Western market, you'll see a bunch of them because it's a consumption market, plus a very high divorce rate which means you're always peacocking again in the market, you're trying to be fit and be cool and all of that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:19):\nIndia has a very low divorce rate, less than 1%, are arranged marriages.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:24):\nFashion spends, and because we have a lower female participation of labor, India is probably the only market where female fashion spends is less than men's fashion spends.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:33):\nEverywhere else, it's probably five, 6x more for them.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:36):\nSo what happens is you start appreciating what the country values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:40):\nFor example, I have noticed that many patriarchal societies have a very significant market cap in financial services versus consumption.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:50):\nAnd these broad patterns, you start thinking about very, very differently.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:55):\nSo many lessons there.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:56):\nI love this idea of a founder being an uncertainty absorber.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:00):\nThis other point you made about Zuck becoming the Shiva and destruction touches on something Brian Chesky and I chatted a bit about, how founders often start in control, very micromanaging, just driving the ship.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:13):\nAnd then as the company grows, they delegate and empower and then things start to slow down and then they come back, play the Shiva and take control again.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:23):\nIs there anything there that you've seen-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:25):\nYeah, but that's the universe.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:26):\nThe universe goes through the exact same phases.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:28):\nSo if you study Indian mythology, you'll see that there's a Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cycles and every yugg As it’s called, goes through these three phases all the time.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:38):\nBeautiful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):\nI see.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):\nSo this is just inevitable.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:41):\nThis is the circle of life.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:42):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:43):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:44):\nI love how this all just ties back to your philosophy background.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):\nIt's beautiful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:54):\nAre you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:59):\nProbably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:07):\nLet's change that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:08):\nProduct managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come over one day in San Francisco.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:18):\nThe product community is coming together to learn how

product teams to get the most out of customer insights.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:52):\nCheck it out at dovetail.com/lenny.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):\nSo, on CRED.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:57):\nSo here's a funny thing that happened.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:58):\nI asked people on Twitter what questions to ask you on this podcast, and one of the most common questions was “When do you think you'll become profitable?”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:06):\nWhich is interesting because when I have other CEOs that are founding a company that is, and most companies aren't profitable, nobody's asking that question.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:14):\nSo I'm just curious, why is that such a common question that comes up?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:17):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:19):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:21):\nAs a country, most businesses were of trading, you buy something at low cost, sell at a higher price and you make profit.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:30):\nMost of our businesses, most of our family businesses were trading.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:35):\nBut building a CapEx heavy distribution, monetizing it later on, focusing on high revenue growth rate versus trying to get profitability first, is not known to us.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:47):\nSo when they see these large numbers of losses, there's a shock. “Why would somebody give you this kind of money?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:56):\nAnd  by the way, my own dad wouldn't respect me till I was building a profitable company.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:01):\nSo it's not surprising that people in India have these comments, but it also comes from not understanding how businesses are built in the internet world, where VCs are giving you the capital to build distribution, unique product edge, brand, all of that stuff, and then monetize later on and monetize big and then have very large profit pools to go after.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:23):\nBut a lot of times this comes from not understanding this business, and I feel it'll change because many internet companies are now getting very profitable and public listed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:36):\nSo we'll have a decade.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:39):\nLet's understand one thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:40):\nIn the US, maybe 27-30% of the US market cap is now tech companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:46):\nIn India tech companies would probably make less than 2- 3% of the market cap.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:51):\nSo we are mostly, and I'm not saying India has this fabulous history of building very, very profitable tech companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:57):\nWe are probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:02):\nBut we are still figuring out what this means.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:05):\nAnd the fact that this question, by the way, I can tell you one thing that, I have been asked this question by people on Twitter way more than any of my investors have ever asked me this question. This also creates an arbitrage for entrepreneurs who can actually build businesses and have the ability to raise capital and prove their business model with very high revenue growth rate and build large brands and so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:29):\nBut I find it fascinating as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:32):\nAlso, one thing we see fascinating in India is that there is an immense amount of trolling and doubt that will come in your comments no matter what you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:42):\nSo if you see any founder in India, they'll post something about the thing, the comments will rarely have appreciation.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:50):\nSo it feels sad because, when you see global companies do stuff, Indians will lose their shit on Apple Vision Pro and all this stuff and Twitter will go gaga over it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:01):\nBut I think when it comes to...and I believe envy is hyperlocal.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:08):\nWe do not envy Elon Musk for all the stuff he does because he's so far away.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:13):\nBut we envy our own because they were just like us not many years ago.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:19):\nAnd therefore envy is like wifi.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:23):\nIt's like a hyperlocal service.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:25):\nHow do you stay positive and focused and not let that stuff bring you down?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:31):\nAnd do you have advice for founders in India that are dealing with the same sort of feedback?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:35):\nIt's funny the number of calls I've got from founders who start getting hate. I’m the go-to person to get these call because they've seen me get it for many more years.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:45):\nAnd I tell people that we couldn't have made it this far if we cared about criticism of everybody versus people who've done better than us.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:58):\nIf somebody who's done anything better than me gives me any amount of criticism, I will absolutely flip and make all the changes and evolve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:08):\nAnd I seek feedback all the time from people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:12):\nBut if I start taking feedback from everybody who does not understand the nuance and empathize with what I'm doing, I'm not saying that we should not take customer feedback, that's very different.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:19):\nBut let's say somebody commenting about your business, who does not understand the nuance of it, you can't be reacting to everything.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:27):\nAnd I often tell people that there's a reason elements with lower valencies are called noble gases because they're hardest to get reactions from.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:38):\nThat's over my head, but I love it anyway.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:42):\nIt's so interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:43):\nI love all these elements you're pointing out of how different building in India is. I think people in the US have no idea about it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:49):\nAnd so I appreciate you getting into all these little elements.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:53):\nIs there anything else around the Indian market that may surprise people before we go in a different direction about building a startup there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:59):\nFor all the challenges, India remains the most promising market that one can be building for right now because everything is going our way.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:07):\nWe have all sorts of digital public infrastructure, government support, all these great people doing extraordinary things, apart from the Twitter noise.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:17):\nAnd Twitter is designed for outrage getting likes.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:21):\nSo I wouldn't read too much into it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:23):\nBut I think all of us are doing well because we have an audience set, an evolved ecosystem that is fully supporting us and really taking it forward.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:34):\nSo I think I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in building because of this extremely vibrant, crazy opportunity that one can learn from.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:43):\nHowever, I often wish that I could get a one month internship with Brian and learn how to do things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:51):\nAnd I've never had the luxury.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:53):\nI can only watch his podcast with you to learn a few things, but what if I got a chance to be there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:58):\nAnd I miss that part where I've never been really trained by these extraordinary product brains or even observed them make decisions.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:08):\nSo I recently posted one thing that the word ‘operation theater’ comes because operating used to be a public process and people used to pay money to watch surgeries and see all the bloody gory stuff and even before anesthesia was born.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:21):\nAnd there's so much joy in seeing somebody do their action.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:26):\nAnd I wish there was a theater for Brian taking a product decision, Zuck taking a hard call on killing a product or seeing Tim rejecting all the ideas that they have before the GTM of a product.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:42):\nI think we could benefit so much from that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:45):\nAnd unfortunately it remains in very small circles.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:47):\nAnd like I said, the reason I said you do a fabulous job of removing some of the information asymmetry and kind of making it more democratic.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:54):\nBut there is so much more that we all could learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:57):\nAnd I feel extremely envious of many people who have the opportunity to work with the best of the best because, many of us from India never had the luxury. We had to figure out everything on our own.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):\nHow cool would that be just to have a camera in some of those meetings just as a learning experience, because very few people are in those rooms and there's so much to learn.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:21):\nI think though people will find, “Holy shit, one, this is how decisions are made, what is going on?”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:26):\nAnd two is , “I don't want to work for this person.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:29):\nThis sounds very difficult and stressful.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:33):\nThose are probably some takeaways that will emerge.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:36):\nKind of along these lines, something that comes up a lot in your talks and work is curiosity.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:43):\nYou have a show called CRED curious.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:46):\nYou often talk about the power of curiosity.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:48):\nI'm just curious, why is curiosity so important to you and why is it important for other people to always stay curious and what value is there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:47:57):\nI think a curious person is somebody who is constantly demonstrating that they are not proud of their expertise, and they will demonstrate extraordinary amounts of excitement when they face a problem which they have no clue how to solve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:17):\nAnd therefore a lot of people stop growing because they want to constantly demonstrate their expertise versus demonstrating their curiosity.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:27):\nBecause, curiosity should come from security because imagine- I'm the founder, CEO of this company and this group of 60 people on WhatsApp, somebody posts something and asks a dumb question, “What does this word mean?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:41):\nYou need to have the security to feel okay with it, but a lot of people out off insecurity try to demonstrate expertise and do it or Google to not ask these people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:52):\nAnd I think that slows down the compounding growth and I think it keeps you from being very good at adapting.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:02):\nSo it's funny, I was recently. GPT is my favorite thing to keep asking random questions because now I don't need to really worry about Google having those questions answered around because I can ask the GPT.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:12):\nSo I recently asked the question: which species or animals have survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common in all of them?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:22):\nSo GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles, and all of these animals have survived to do this thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:34):\nSo three distinct traits were, one, ability to reduce metabolism at will.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:43):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:45):\nI can bring down my metabolism by 1:20 or a crazy, crazy scale that they can bring the metabolism down.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:54):\nBy the way, ancient yogis have demonstrated this as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:00):\nIt comes from the same yogic practice.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:02):\nThe second thing is about, and if you think about companies, the context is the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:06):\nIf COVID came, you could slow down your metabolism and survive, right?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:12):\nOr you burned your way out and disappeared.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:16):\nThe second thing that was interesting was the very high conversion rate on every attempt to secure food.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:25):\nThey don't go around chasing randomly and doing things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:27):\nThey have a very high conversion rate, which means high judgment and the deadliest bite.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:35):\nSo they'll not chase many options, but if they chase something, they will have the biggest bite and they'll convert it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:41):\nAnd the third thing that was more interesting was that they have survived all sorts of crazy environmental changes, just adapting. And adaptation comes from curiosity.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:56):\nAnd you could see those people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:57):\nIn COVID, there were two sets of people, who were completely gone into a shell and there were those who were curious.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:03):\n“Okay, so what do I do with this?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:05):\n“What happens now?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:06):\n“Do I need to change something?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:07):\n“Do I need to tweak something?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:09):\nSo the ability to change very quickly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:13):\nI often feel that curiosity is that demonstration of the ability to adapt and learn, and you only create more information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:25):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:27):\nAll the best companies in the world have unfair information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:33):\nAnd that comes from curiosity. Because you're constantly collecting dots, connecting dots, collecting dots, connecting dots, and end up creating this unique edge for yourself and information asymmetry for yourself.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:48):\nAnd if you assume that “I have collected enough,” no human life is going to be enough to connect and connect all the dots.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:56):\nWe'll never be able to get..\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:58):\nAnd sometimes I envy the stuff that you do because you are efficiently connecting and collecting dots by having the luxury of all these people to talk to, and you are making more dots getting connected.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:52:12):\nSo your information asymmetry is growing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:14):\nWait until you IPO, and then someday maybe leave CRED and then you could start this podcast with everyone like this and connect all the dots.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:22):\nAnd I think that's a reference to Danny Meyer who's the founder of all these fancy restaurants and big on hospitality and has this phrase “Always be collecting dots”, I think ABCD, I’ll link to that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:33):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):\nWait, this is really interesting, this list of what are the common traits of the most long-lasting animals?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:41):\nThey can lower their metabolism at will, they have a high conversion rate to get food, and they've survived many types of environments.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:49):\nAnd I think there's a lot you can transform as you've done, to startups and leaders.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:54):\nThis could be its own…\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:55):\nif you haven't written about this, this would be a cool blog post.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:59):\nI'm curious who you look up to in business, either in India and outside India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:53:05):\nWho comes to mind where you're like, I really inspired, I'm inspired by these folks?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:10):\nI often tell people that I hate the word ‘favorite’ because it tells me to become limited in my mind.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:16):\nSo I stay away from ‘favorite’, but I learn all the time from everybody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:22):\nAnd there are so many people to learn from across the world and in history, in the recent past and every time you'll discover fascinating, extraordinary things about them.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:35):\nSo I don't think I have a person.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:38):\nI am this person who thinks about about: ”How did they solve this hard problem.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:42):\nSo one of the things that we started doing recently and not very ritualistic about it so far is, I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask ourselves, ”What are the hardest problems we solved last month?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:00):\nAnd it's very hard to come up with an answer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:04):\nAnd if you do this to the product leaders, just go around and ask, “What are the hard problems you solved last month?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:11):\nYou'll realize that we all stay very busy and displacement is hard.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:15):\nBut if you notice extraordinarily successful people, they'll have a lot more content to talk about every month, every quarter because they're obsessed with making that big displacement and it does not come by being busy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:35):\nAnd that's another thing that you cannot chase the big thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:37):\nYou don't see a crocodile being busy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:40):\nYou see a crocodile just waiting patiently at the watering hole for that best meal and have the deadliest bite for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:49):\nSo the beautiful definition of predators I read was “one who burns the least amount of calories to earn the most amount of calories.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:59):\nSo how do you become that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:00):\nAnd I think when I meet people who are extraordinary at that, and it comes in all shapes and forms, I learn something from them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:07):\nSo in these meetings you have, are you judging people's success based on how many hard problems they solve?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:13):\nNow that they've heard this, they're going to be like, I need more.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:17):\nBecause if you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:21):\nYou have to be the chief problem solver.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):\nI love that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):\nI often think of leaders as professional firefighters who have just endless fires to put out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:31):\nKind of along the lines of people and where you learn from, are there any sources of content?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:36):\nThis is actually an audience question on Twitter.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:38):\nAnurag Verma asks this, “What are your favorite sources of content to learn from in terms of what's happening in the world and what to pay attention to?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:47):\nI wish I could think of an answer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:50):\nMy method of collecting information is mostly about, I come up with conjectures in my head and then I go all over the place to find out if there is proof if what I'm saying is true or not.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:04):\nFor example, I recently came up with a conjecture that everybody who has been successful in the history of business of vices, historically has done a lot of philanthropy to create a good image for themselves, and therefore is being treated as a respected citizen versus being treated as a person who did vices to make wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:24):\nAnd then I asked GPT to come up with 50 people who did that and what were their vices?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:30):\nHow did they change the reputation by doing lots of philanthropy and all of that stuff?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:36):\nThen a thing happens.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:37):\nAnd then I research in all sorts of directions. And I have no boundaries if I go to chemistry or physics or human behavior to discover some universal principles.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:48):\nSo my method of learning is to constantly come up with conjectures from the dots that you have connected and then absolutely work hard to find proof of it and then use that to connect to the next dot.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:01):\nSo I often tell people that every book you read makes your brain poorer to read the next book.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:10):\nThat's the purpose of books, but that's true for every single thing we learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:13):\nIt makes our brain poorerfor the next thing that we are supposed to learn.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:57:17):\nIs there a recent example of that where you got super sucked into some topic?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:20):\nWell, it's my daily life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:22):\nI get sucked into topics every now and then.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:26):\nFor example, I've been thinking about second order effects of AI and what happens to countries and jobs and how to expect some of these things to change, not change, rate of change, rate of skill change.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:39):\nI got recently obsessed with what happens to lab grown diamonds if they become big?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\nDoes it kill diamonds?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\nDoes it make diamonds bigger?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:46):\nAnd then I looked at parallels.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:48):\nSo, the pearl industry was very big before culture.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:53):\nCultured pearls  came and the high status of pearls disappeared because everybody could have pearls.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:59):\nBut not too long ago, pearls were a very royal thing . Every prince and princess used to have pearls around them, but as soon as it was easy to manufacture in a lab, it lost its value.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:13):\nSo then  I think should I be shorting or going long on diamonds thinking about what happens?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:19):\nBut there'll be a temporary period of making a lot of money on lab grown diamonds, which will kill... it'll become parasitic on the status of diamonds and destroy all of the profit pools.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:31):\nYou heard it here first, time to buy some diamond futures.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:35):\nI feel like there's no one in the world ChatGPT impacted more than you considering how much you want to spend digging into random topics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:43):\nI often wonder, Lenny, that if you took the most serious people and made their GPT searches public, a lot of people will learn because the problem of GPT is now it'll make the people with great questions do well, versus people who are looking for basic answers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:00):\nSo I think the world is going to be unfair to people who will ask great questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:05):\nInteresting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\nWell, I got to ask you, is there any advice you have for asking great questions that has helped you in your work and career and life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:14):\nWhenever somebody has many choices and they make the right choice in whatever domain they have.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:21):\nFor example, let's say you could hire anybody but you hired great people, or let's say you could have married anybody, but you married a great person and so on and so forth. Everybody has many choices to make.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:32):\nHow do they make choices for that domain of expertise?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:38):\nAnd I think that is the most, and many times they're not going to be able to explain how they make great choices.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:43):\nThey'll have to really go into that because they don't really have their mental models figured out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:49):\nThey cannot articulate, they cannot coach, they cannot explain.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:51):\nBut if you can figure out how they make great decisions in general, in whatever domain of work they're doing, you'll find many interesting insights coming over there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:01):\nThe other good question to ask is about second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:06):\nWhat do they think will happen to the world and why did they come to that conclusion?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:11):\nAnd you see that full chain of thoughts is very powerful.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:15):\nFor example, second order thinking is known to be the most powerful trait to predict the success of somebody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:22):\nBut I often wonder what happened in the childhood of people who became great at second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:30):\nAnd that question is not fully discovered or discussed yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:34):\nAnd I've found some loose examples such as if you played strategy games or only physical games as a strong correlation to building\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:42):\nSo rigor came from physical games, but second order thinking came from playing strategy games as a kid.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:48):\nAnd if you had both, you could do really well in general because you have discipline and second order thinking together.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:55):\nThen did you ever have an exercise of looking at history?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:01):\nFor example, one of the things I recommend for parents to do with their kids, I call it the ‘Whyfi school’, is ask them  one ‘why’ question every meal and let them come back with answers the next day.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:15):\nFor example, “Why do humans wear jewelry” and ”Why is something a certain way?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:23):\nAnd let them go into the full depth of history and find out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:29):\nWhy is it so expensive to advertise in the Super Bowl?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:32):\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:33):\nYou just take one question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:34):\nAnd if you train them on why, they evolve at a very different rate because how, what are the questions which do not evolve at a much higher rate, because ‘why’ is the deep question and it breaks a lot of things in your head.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:48):\nOr another question about origin stories that “How did elevators come into being?” and \"what made your phones happen?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:54):\n“What made microphones happen and why is it called microphone and why is it called a phone?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:59):\nAnd if you just want to go into this depth, you'll see people build second order thinking automatically because either you go into history and see second order thinking coming along with that, or you play games that train your brain for second order thinking with the spectrum.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:13):\nBut that's a broad range of things that I think people should be asking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:17):\nI'm looking forward to Kunal’s children's raising book, like a book to help you raise kids.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:23):\nThis could be your future.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:24):\nI don't have kids so I can run experiments on everybody else's kids.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:27):\nSo it's a great thing to do.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:29):\nI feel like with these questions, I think the rule has to be you can't just ask ChatGPT for the answer if the block it-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:34):\nActually it's not bad.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:36):\nI think you should encourage it because we have to assume that we are going to be all co-pilots of AI now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:42):\nWhat you have to do is derive the second order insight that, “Okay, this is true.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:46):\nWhere is the similarity of this in somewhere else?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:49):\nGive me an example of this found somewhere else, and so on and so forth.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:54):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:55):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:56):\nI have just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:00):\nFirst, let's visit the contrarian corner.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:03):\nI'm curious. What's something that you believe that very few other people would agree with you on and why do you hold that belief?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:12):\nOur understanding of wealth and what wealth is, is flawed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:16):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but storage of energy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:20):\nAnd therefore the reason wealth is not zero sum is because energy is, and we are just finding  ways to convert energy to our advantage.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:28):\nWe are the only species that has managed to convert all forms of energy to our advantage.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:32):\nKinetic energy and fuel and sound and solar.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:35):\nNo other species has done this.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:37):\nAnd therefore, since the industrial revolution, our wealth has gone like this and continues to be like that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:42):\nAI and nuclear fission and all this stuff will kind of take us right there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:47):\nSo I have a strong view that we will never, never have equality of wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:55):\nIn fact, chasing that is actually a bad idea.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:58):\nBut if you let people do well and chase wealth, they have enough wealth for everybody else and we could help a lot of people out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:06):\nAnd I think it's complicated because we can have all these democratic arguments that wealth is concentrated and all that, but that's the physics of wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:16):\nIt'll always be concentrated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:18):\nYou change these mediums, companies, countries.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:23):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but an entropic complexity that'll keep changing its form and shape.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:29):\nYou can keep fighting it or accept its physics and reap the benefit of that physics.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:34):\nI think Elon had this interesting point that wealth is just a database where everyone's wealth I guess is just a row in the database and here's how much everyone has and you're just transferring numbers around and that's the whole economy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:49):\nNo, but the nuance that is important is that you can actually increase the database size infinitely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:54):\nThat's true.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:55):\nAnd therefore his vision of the sun's energy, if you really convert all the energy to our advantage, the amount of wealth we will create for humans is disproportionate.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:04):\nAnd all the species that are managed to collaborate and cooperate to create wealth, for example, let's define wealth as biomass.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:12):\nSo let's say ants and bacteria and humans are the only few things that have the largest biomass on this planet because we figured out how to make energy work to our advantage.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:23):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:24):\nI love all the directions we've gone.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:27):\nProbably the last question, is there a story of failure in your career that would be interesting to share?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:34):\nSomething that taught you an important lesson?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:36):\nIt's a series of failures.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:39):\nI think there is no escape for anybody who's done anything in life, not failed a lot, like every day, every thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:46):\nBut I would say that many initiatives, many products, companies that I've built have absolutely failed, hirings that have failed, trust broken, betrayals.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:01):\nSo I think there is no end to it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:04):\nBut I think entrepreneurs have this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you hold, and you forget the story.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:21):\nFor example, COVID has literally no memory for me.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:24):\nI just don't remember what was COVID.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:27):\nIt's just a blank in my head right now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:30):\nAnd I think that humans are great at forgetting the memory of failure, but remember the lesson from failure.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:36):\nBut I think I'm constantly learning, and I often believe that life is too short to make all our mistakes ourselves.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:43):\nSo we should be learning from other people's failures as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:46):\nAnd a lot of times we don't do that because we believe that we are special, nothing like that will happen to us, but as humans, we should be learning.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:55):\nI would say that my life started from a failure.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:58):\nMy family went through a severe financial crisis.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:01):\nI had to start working from age 15 and I feel till date, I'm just trying to escape that failure that happened in the family.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:10):\nSo I think many of us are just fighting that initial large failure that we've had and don't want to be anywhere near that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:21):\nAnd although we are significantly far away from that, the feeling is exactly that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:27):\nCircles back to one of our first few questions about the chips on shoulders driving a lot of motivation.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:33):\nThere's this phrase, ”Chips on shoulders drive chips in pockets.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:39):\nThat's interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\nIs there anything more you want to share about that early challenge you ran into or is that something you've shared often?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:46):\nNo, I mean I've shared that enough, but I used to not talk about it before because I used to think that I would get some sympathy for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:54):\nAnd only in the recent past did I speak about it because I want people to realize that I was not some gifted kid who had some rich parents who made me extraordinarily bright and put me in great schools and colleges and I made my way through that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:12):\nI used to not talk  about it earlier because there's a lot of tendency to give sympathy to those people who say, \"Oh, this guy had struggled.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:17):\nAnd I don't want to be given any credit for playing that poverty card or this card or struggling for food card.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:29):\nThat's not an excuse.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:32):\nThere are so many people in the world who've done extraordinarily well because they had the gift of struggle.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:37):\nAnd I often tell people that this is the biggest curse of successful parents, that that's the only gift they'll not be able to give to their kids, the gift of struggle that they had.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:46):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\nI think about that a lot.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\nWe have a kid, he's eight months now, and so I'm trying to figure out the balance of struggle versus making life easy and great, a new challenge for me to figure out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:57):\nBefore we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else, Kunal, you wanted to share or leave listeners with?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\nAnything?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\nAny last nuggets of thoughts?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:04):\nWell, I would love for the listeners from different fields of product to share what you're learning without being fearful of the judgment of your peers, because there are many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:22):\nAnd I believe that a lot more could be contributing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:25):\nAnd a lot of your listeners are really bright people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:28):\nIf they all shared, many people from many places in the world would learn and achieve some amount of success.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:38):\nThanks to your sharing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:39):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:40):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:43):\nAre you ready?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:45):\nAll set.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:46):\nLet's do it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:47):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:53):\nIt keeps changing a lot, but my books are usually around understanding human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:58):\nAnd I keep changing based on the person, but I think it's the biggest subject.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:03):\nAll our customers, all our investors, all our employees, all our relationships are all humans.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:08):\nAnd the subject that we are weakest on is human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:11):\nAnd how do we live this life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:13):\nWe are playing life on extremely hard mode if you don't learn human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:17):\nSo I would say that's one thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:19):\nThe second thing, evolutionary biology, teaches a lot about how species evolve and how they make decisions and what are the core motivations that drive everybody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:28):\nSo that's another one I would recommend.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:30):\nAnd I don't want to make a recommendation because I can barely finish a book to be honest.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:36):\nSo I believe in drifting and getting deeper into topics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:39):\nSo understanding the topics versus trying to say, give me these three books and I'm going to be good.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:43):\nAnd the last one I would say, is that anything that can make you learn something about their journey versus their success.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:53):\nSo sometimes autobiographies are too celebratory in some ways, but if you can just kind of understand how… any book that can teach you about how people recover from a setback in great detail is a great book to learn from.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:11):\nAn audience member on Twitter actually asked a similar question along these lines, if there's one book that you could read over and over and over, what would that be?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:20):\nIs there one?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:21):\nI absolutely don't believe in reading over and over because I believe that we are evolving.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:29):\nYou might discover the same stuff coming from different books and you would say, \"Oh, I can categorize this in my brain again and again.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:34):\nBut I think we tend to become believers, and it becomes too religious if you repeat.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:47):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:49):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:54):\nI love Oppenheimer because of the struggles and Nolan's craft of making the movies, but nothing in the recent past that I feel is right up there.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:12:05):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:11):\nI like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:15):\nFor example, if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:23):\nCan you explain the world- from what happens to money, what happens to law?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:28):\nWhat happens to countries?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:29):\nWhat happens to the military?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:30):\nWhat happens to the stock market?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:32):\nWhat happens to the order of things?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:35):\nAnd I would say less than 10% of really smart people can have really good answers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:43):\nSo it tells you how good they are at second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:48):\nBut the questions can keep changing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:49):\nFor example, if you said that, what if arranged marriages were banned in India, and you got capital punishment for doing arranged marriages?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:57):\nWhat happens to the country?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:59):\nHow do we change from there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:01):\nLike some absurd scenarios, but then what happens after that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:05):\nNot to give away your secret sauce, but what do you look for in an answer that gives you a sense there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:09):\nThe range of things that they could go into and think about-  if this happens, B happens and then C happens.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:18):\nThe leaps they could make.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:20):\nAnd just so people understand, when you're talking about second order thinking, what's the simplest way to describe that concept?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:26):\nI think the simplest way to think about this is being able to correctly judge the butterfly effect of an event as close as possible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:37):\nFor example, a lot of people in the stock market use that to say how stocks will go up and down.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:44):\nThere's something that has happened in the market.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:46):\n“Oh, there is a war now with Russia, then what happens to the market?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:52):\nCan you be good at predicting that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:54):\nBut in everything in life, if this happens, a lot of people hate this because it's very taxing to the brain.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:02):\nThe brain absolutely hates second order thinking unless you've trained your brain with second order thinking all the time that it looks forward to it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:10):\nSo you convert this into a hate versus a reward cycle, and that comes with probably doing it early on in your life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:19):\nLater on, people hate doing second order thinking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:22):\nIt is.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):\nYes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):\nThat sounds like a lot of work for the brain.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):\nJust a few more questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:27):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered and that you really love?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:32):\nI'm looking forward to my Vision Pro coming soon.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:37):\nIt's a future favorite product.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:39):\nWe have actually Boz from Meta coming on as the next guest in my recording.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:43):\nI'm not sure when they come out in sequence, but we're going to talk about his thoughts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:48):\nThe most fascinating thing that I saw was Zuck talking about the utility of Meta being better than Vision Pro and their product.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:59):\nAnd that's exactly going to work well for Apple because when you try to make the product more utilitarian, it loses status.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:08):\nAnd if you study animals, you realize that the one which gets the highest mating success is the one which can demonstrate the ability to waste resources and not be very efficient with resources.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:20):\nAnd therefore people who are known to buy a product that is wasteful will actually own higher status.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:26):\nAnd I think Zuck made it actually quite easy for Apple to demonstrate their superior positioning by saying that, \"Oh, we are not as efficient, we are not as cheap.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:35):\nWe are not for everybody.\"\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):\nJust continue to blow minds even on our lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:42):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends and family, find useful in work or in life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:50):\nIt's not a favorite motto, but I think we truly are transient and we are very lucky to have this life that we have and we have to make the most out of it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:01):\nAnd all these struggles will mean nothing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:05):\nI often tell people that you should wish for your life to be so great that you have collected the highest amount of content when you are old, and you have no end to the stories that you can talk about.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:16):\nThat reminds me of a book I once read that really had an impact on me where somebody was trying to make a movie of their life and the producer was like, \"There's nothing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:24):\nThere's no good movie here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:25):\nYou have not done enough interesting things.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:27):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:29):\nAnd so he turned his lens of what to do in life, by thinking what would make a great story.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:36):\nAnd so he just started to do a a great story, something where you overcome challenges and achieve something you wanted.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:41):\nAnd so that became his life motto.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:43):\n“I'm going to try hard things and overcome them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:45):\nAnd that's going to be my life.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:48):\nI'll link to that book in the show notes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:51):\nFinal question, do you have this series on Twitter that you call Monday Motivations?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:56):\nI'm curious what's motivating you these days?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:58):\nI find the internet is filled with all these people trying to give fake motivation and make money off that stuff.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:04):\nAnd it's almost like a drug for people to feel, ”Oh my God, there's motivation, I'm going to do well.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:11):\nI just wanted to remind people that all success comes from an extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work, and there is no shortcut to anything material coming in life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:22):\nAnd so the Monday  motivation post comes as the anti-motivation post because the world is filled with... I believe that the biggest profit making scheme that I've seen in recent times is to tell people to love themselves and they'll pay you money for saying that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:40):\nAnd I think the best way to love yourself is to keep evolving.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:44):\nSo my motivation comes from evolution, connecting dots, solving harder problems than I've solved in the past.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:51):\nAnd I think life is ultimately a game where you want to feel that your levels have changed and your skills have changed constantly.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:17:59):\nKunal, you are wonderful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:01):\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):\nTwo final questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):\nWhere can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this stuff?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:07):\nAnd how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:09):\nYou can find me on social media.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:10):\nLook for Kunal Shah, you'll find me everywhere.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:13):\nI usually have a different personality on each social media.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:16):\nAnd in terms of being helpful, keep tagging me on interesting things that you discover that gave you that moment of, ”Oh my God, I did not know this.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:25):\nI would love that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:27):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:28):\nKunal, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:31):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:32):\nBye everyone.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:32):\n78:34Thank you so much for listening.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:35):\nIf you found this valuable, you can subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:42):\nAlso, please consider giving us a rating or leaving a review as that really helps other listeners find the podcast.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:48):\nYou can find all past episodes or learn more about the show at lennyspodcast.com.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:54):\nSee you in the next episode.",
  "zh": "LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:00):\nMicrosoft、Adobe、Alphabet、IBM、Palo Alto Networks，甚至 Starbucks，这些公司的 CEO 都出生在印度，后来移民到美国。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:08):\n很多 CEO 之所以做得好，是因为他们很好地遵循了创始人的\"dharma\"（法则）。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:13):\n\"这些是传给我的原则，我要延续这些原则，并让它变得更强大。\"\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:16):\n我想继续聊聊印度，聊聊它有什么不同，以及如何打造在印度能成功的产品。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:21):\n从来没有印度人一辈子拿过时薪。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:24):\n对时间的概念是不一样的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:27):\n你认为印度创业公司最大的机会是什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:30):\n印度正在改变，因为现在我们第一次看到创始人受到尊重，独角兽企业受到赞扬。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:36):\n我们有国家创业日，这可能是第一代必须证明自己能成为大型盈利公司的创业者。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:42):\n我不想在别的地方创业。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:48):\n今天我的嘉宾是 Kunal Shah。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:51):\nKunal 是印度乃至全世界最知名和最受尊敬的企业家和产品领导者之一。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:58):\n他在 Twitter 和 LinkedIn 上分享无尽的智慧，拥有超过 100 万粉丝。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:03):\n他是 CRED 的 CEO 兼创始人，这是一家总部位于印度的金融科技创业公司，最近估值超过 60 亿美元，截至几年前处理了印度所有信用卡账单支付的 20% 以上。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:16):\n在 CRED 之前，他创办了其他三家创业公司，包括 Freecharge，他以超过 4 亿美元的价格将其出售给 Snapdeal。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:23):\nKunal 是一位深度思考者，无论是关于产品还是关于人生。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:27):\n他的背景实际上是哲学，当你听到他分享建议时，这一点非常明显。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:34):\n在我们的对话中，我们深入探讨了在印度工作和创业与美国市场和其他市场的不同之处，包括为什么信任如此重要，以及为什么印度有这么多人更加规避风险。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:46):\n我们谈论印度市场最大的挑战和机遇，为什么有这么多成功的印度移民在科技公司担任 CEO 职位，以及我们可以从中学到什么。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:56):\n还有，为什么印度的公司可以快速增长 DAU（日活跃用户）但 ARPU（每用户平均收入）却上不去，这对在印度打造产品意味着什么。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:03):\n我们还谈到如何保持好奇心和开放心态，以及二阶思维的力量。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:07):\n还有失败的故事，很多反常识的观点等等。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:13):\n如果你喜欢这个播客，别忘了在你最喜欢的播客应用或 YouTube 上订阅和关注这个播客。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:18):\n这是避免错过未来节目的最好方式，也对播客帮助巨大。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:23):\n非常感谢 Cyan，我的 ET，帮我联系到 Kunal。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:27):\n话不多说，在赞助商简短介绍后，我将为你带来 Kunal Shah。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:33):\n本期节目由 WorkOS 赞助。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:36):\n如果你在构建 SaaS 应用，在某个时刻你的客户会开始要求企业级功能，比如 SAML 身份验证和 SCIM 配置。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:45):\n这就是 WorkOS 的用武之地，让你快速、轻松地为应用添加企业级功能。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:51):\n他们的 API 易于理解，这样你可以快速交付并回到构建其他功能上，已经有数百家其他公司使用 WorkOS，包括你可能知道的 Vercel、Webflow 和 Loom。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:03):\nWorkOS 最近还推出了 AuthKit，一个完整的身份验证和用户管理服务。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:09):\n它本质上是 Auth0 的现代替代品，但价格更好，API 更灵活。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:15):\nAuthKit 的设计开箱即用就很惊艳，你也可以完全自定义以适应你的应用品牌。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:21):\n从你的第一个用户到最大的企业客户，这都是一次轻松的体验。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:26):\n最棒的是，AuthKit 对任何开发者免费，最多可支持 100 万用户。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:31):\n访问 workos.com/lenny 了解更多。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:35):\n就是 workos.com/lenny。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:39):\n本期节目由 Orb 赞助。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:42):\n作为一家企业，你关心收入，但作为产品团队，你最不想做的就是因为团队必须从头重建计费系统而延迟产品发布或价格变更。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:52):\nOrb 是一个灵活的基于使用量的计费引擎，让你轻松调整定价。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:57):\n像 Vercel 和 Replit 这样增长最快的产品团队信任 Orb 来支持他们的定价变更和发布。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:04):\n使用 Orb 更快地发布产品，不再担心计费问题，轻松且可控地调整定价。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:11):\n访问 withorb.com/lenny 查看。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY

(00:04:35):\n就像我之前说的，印度是你工作的巨大受益者。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:40):\n我们都是通过自己摸索、看一些内容、读一些资料来学习产品艺术的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:49):\n所以为你所做的一切点赞。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:51):\n就像我之前说的，你在消除产品艺术的信息不对称方面做得非常出色，让我们这些世界各地的人都能获得这些知识。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:02):\n谢谢你。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:03):\n哇，我真的很感激。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:04):\n这对我来说已经感觉很棒了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:06):\n我有一大批...所以事实证明这个播客在印度有大量听众，你也是。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:12):\n所以我觉得这次对话对很多人来说会非常特别、非常有意义。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:18):\n我想从一个非常实战的东西开始。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:21):\n有一个你提出的产品框架，我非常喜欢，在过去几年里我至少和 30 位创始人分享过。这实际上是我最初发现你的方式；我听说了这个东西，然后想，这个 Kunal Shah 是谁？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:34):\n现在看我们，在聊天。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:36):\n你能简要解释一下这个框架，然后说说你是如何使用它的，或者你建议人们如何应用它？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:43):\n哦，对了，它叫 Delta 4。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:44):\n我都不知道我有没有说名字。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:46):\n是的，它叫 Delta 4 框架，但我认为它其实很简单。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:51):\n如果你想想，很多人说你的产品必须好 10 倍，但这不太好衡量。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:57):\n你不知道自己是否真的好 10 倍，除非你在自欺欺人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:01):\n对我来说的触发点实际上是，我是印度不寻常的科技创始人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:06):\n我是印度唯一一个人文/哲学专业出身进入科技行业的创始人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:12):\n我常常想，那些和我同辈的人，或者比我领先的人，是否在学术上或其他方面明显更聪明。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:21):\n为什么我的第一家创业公司 Freecharge 会成功，我在 2015 年以近 4.5 亿美元退出？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:28):\n我当时想，\"是什么让这一切发生的？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:31):\n因为我不会被列入印度那些顶级 IIT 排名靠前者的超级联盟。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:38):\n这让我开始了这个哲学探索，去找出是什么让事物成功。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:43):\n所以这个简单的框架是，我经常举的一个例子是，想象一下打车的老方法和 Uber。如果我让你给 Uber 和老式出租车的效率打分，你会怎么说，Lenny？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:58):\n我很好奇。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:59):\n满分 10 分？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:00):\n嗯，给出租车打 3 分，然后 Uber 大概 9 分。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:04):\n对。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:05):\n所以每当你看到产品效率 delta 大于或等于 4 时，会发生三件事。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:14):\n它是不可逆的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:16):\n第二是你对它的失败有很高的容忍度。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:21):\n如果 Uber 偶尔出点问题，你会说\"天哪，我真的要停止使用它\"吗？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:30):\n不会。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:31):\n第三件事是我称之为 UBP，\"独特的值得炫耀的主张\"（Unique Brag-worthy Proposition）。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:37):\n每当人们解锁一个 Delta 4 产品或服务时，他们就忍不住谈论或分享它。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:46):\n因此，所有 Delta 4 产品自然会有更低的 CAC（客户获取成本），有时甚至零 CAC，因为人们，人类...\n\n想想看，Lenny，你是怎么发现 Google 的，肯定不是通过广告，也肯定不是通过这里那里的效果营销。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:57):\n是有人给你展示了演示，然后你就说，\"天哪，这太疯狂了。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:01):\n这就是我现在看到的情况，OpenAI 上发生的一切，以及围绕 LLM 发生的一切，感觉就像魔法一样，这就是 Delta 4，因为做事情的效率在使用前后现在显示出了这一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:12):\n但失败才是真正的问题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:15):\n把所有东西都做成技术产品并不能让事情变得更高效。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:19):\n我们举个例子。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:21):\n在线购买西装和线下购买西装，所有技术，很酷的东西，所有功能都内置了。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:30):\n你觉得在线购买西装的效率和线下购买西装相比如何？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:35):\n我实际上试过，结果非常不合身。完全不合身。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:39):\n所以虽然很高效，但最终结果并不好，可能往往都不太好。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:45):\n所以可能——\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:46):\n整体效率得分，你会打多少？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:48):\n在线购买西装？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:50):\n对，相比线下。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:53):\n我可能会给 5 分和 5 分。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:56):\n线下实际上可能是更好的体验。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:58):\n我给 7 分。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:59):\n这太疯狂了，因为你打破了这个原则，这是一个科技产品，但线下的效率反而更好。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:06):\n因此，当 delta 小于 4 的时候，你会发现它是可逆的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:15):\n你不会看到人们炫耀它，而且你对它零容忍。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:21):\n所以你永远不会在线购买西装。我现在就可以告诉你这一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:25):\n所以我认为这是一个简单的框架。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:28):\n我相信如果很多公司应用它... 我现在知道美国的很多 VC 把这个作为分析师培训项目的一部分。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:36):\nSequoia 的某个人跟我提到过，他们把这个作为培训内容的一部分，但在印度我们还没有真正应用这些东西。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:46):\n我认为这是一个简单的框架，至少要了解。你可以把它应用到功能上，可以应用到产品上，也可以应用到业务上。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:55):\n而且通常这是一个更长的概念。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:57):\n我们可以从很多方面来讨论它，因为它源于一些关于熵和进化生物学的研究，这是我发现和思考 Delta 4 的根源，\"一个物种什么时候会被颠覆\"或者\"什么是熵，为什么低熵需要高熵的增长？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:18):\n这本身就是一整天的播客内容。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:19):\n所以改天再说吧。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\n我们把这个留到以后的后续节目，深入探讨 Delta 4 的心理学。我来总结一下，因为我认为这是一个非常强大的框架，我发现它对说服创始人为什么他们的产品没有起飞很有用。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:32):\n他们可能觉得这比现有的更好。经典的例子是，一个更好的 Excel。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:36):\n看，这比 Excel 好太多了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:38):\n它可以做所有这些事情。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:39):\n你不需要学习所有这些公式。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:41):\n但我喜欢这里的诀窍就是，人们对现有解决方案打 1 到 10 分，他们会给你的解决方案打 1 到 10 分多少？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:48):\n它必须高出 4 分，否则没人会关注。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:52):\n我认为这很简单。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:53):\n人们很忙，他们有足够多的事情要做，有足够多的产品和应用，如果不是好很多，他们不会花时间真正深入研究某样东西。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:00):\n完全正确。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\n我要换个完全不同的方向。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:03):\n我想谈谈在美国的印度裔 CEO。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:06):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:07):\n所以今天 Microsoft、Alphabet、Adobe（一家 2500 亿美元的公司）、IBM（一家 1700 亿美元的公司）、Palo Alto Networks（一家 1000 亿美元的公司），甚至 Starbucks（也是一家 1000 亿美元的公司，我查了一下）的 CEO。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:25):\n还有 Elon 接管之前的 Twitter。这些公司的 CEO 都出生在印度并移民到美国。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:32):\n我可能错了，但我认为这是除了美国白人之外，科技公司 CEO 中最大的族群。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\n所以我很好奇，你认为为什么印度移民在美国的商业和科技领域如此成功，特别是在这些非常高的职位上。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:50):\n我最好奇的是，我们能从中学到什么？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:53):\n我们能从他们的成功中学到什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:55):\n这是个很好的问题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:56):\n我经常思考这个问题，我很幸运地见到了这些人中的相当一部分，并有机会真正和他们探讨到底发生了什么。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:07):\n所以有几个突出的点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:10):\n同样，这些都是我无法以任何方式证明的猜测，但这是一个思想实验来讨论这些事情。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:18):\n首先，一般来说，离开国家的移民通常以一种非常不同的方式肩负着使命感。他们为了走出去并取得成功而必须经历的奋斗，以及把他们带到那里的那种渴望。他们没有任何特权。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:37):\n他们来自非常非常卑微的背景，一开始几乎没有钱。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:42):\n所以我认为这种力量是真实的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:46):\n你也可以说这对许多移民来说都是如此。但对数学或逻辑的重视在社会中以一种重要的方式出现，这种影响。比如说，很多工程专业毕业生只来自少数几个国家，因为社会倾向于早期接触数学。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:04):\n我认为这有助于创造会被欣赏的地位。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:10):\n例如，成为工程师、医生... 作为哲学专业的学生，我在社会上是被放弃的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:16):\n所以我在这里是稀有商品的原因，是因为除非你通过这些非常难的考试并做非常非常难的事情，否则你不会被认为是非常聪明的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:25):\n所以筛选标准本身就很高。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:28):\n但还有另一个完全有趣的框架，我实际上是从这位先生 Devdutt Patnaik 那里学到的。他将印度神话和管理原则结合在一起。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:39):\n这很有趣。有三位主要的印度神。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:43):\n一个是 Brahma，创造之神，Shiva 是毁灭之神。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:49):\n我在这里是概括性地说，但这就是分类。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:52):\n第三个是 Vishnu，维持之神。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:55):\n他们的化身——\"avatar\"这个词来自 Vishnu，他不断改变化身。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:59):\n所以我们有 Rama、Krishna，所有这些神都是他的化身。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:04):\n所以你注意到的是，如果你做一个二维矩阵，把价值观高和价值观低的人，服从性高和服从性低的人放在一起，你会得到一个有趣的二维矩阵。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:19):\n现在，Krishna 神，他是非常受欢迎的化身之一，适合创业者这一类，价值观高但服从性非常低。\n\n他被认为是调皮的神，实际上可以创造很多东西。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:36):\n而Rama则被认为是遵循原则、服从规矩的神。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:41):\n所以他们会遵循'dharma'（正法），并在此基础上扩展。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:45):\n然后还有一些反面角色，比如Ravana，价值观低、服从性也低，还有Duryodhana，他说这个角色服从性高但价值观低。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:55):\n这些都是你不想成为的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:57):\n你会注意到，很多CEO之所以做得好，是因为他们很好地遵循了创始人的'dharma'。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:05):\n他们没有稀释创始公司的创始人的dharma，并且成功地保持了这一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:13):\n而很多CEO有这种需求，说\"哦，我要永久改变这家公司，这将成为我的标志，我要换logo，换名字，做各种各样的事情。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:25):\n但维持'dharma'，我会说\"这些原则是传给我的，我要维持它并让它变得更大\"，这来自于一种谦卑，承认有些东西是以某种纯粹的形式建立的，我认为因此那种特质得以延续。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:41):\n因此我们有Brahma和Shiva这样的角色，创造者和毁灭者。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:47):\n就是这样。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:48):\n但维持才是更难的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:51):\n因此我们的化身会随着时间不断出现，不同的障碍会出现，然后不同的层级会出现。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:57):\n但当你思考原型时，至少就印度CEO而言，我发现他们非常擅长在Krishna和Rama之间切换。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:07):\n他们可以持续地扮演这两个角色，因此他们不断进化，让这些公司越做越大。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:14):\n我认为未来几年我们会看到更多这样的例子，因为现在他们有了这些成功个体的榜样。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:22):\n但关键原则是，如果你问创始人，他们会喜欢这些CEO（如果他们还在的话），因为他们维持了dharma。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:32):\n例如，Tim所做的就是维持Steve Jobs的dharma，因为如果他试图改变Steve Jobs的dharma和公司的价值观，很难想象它能永远持续下去。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:45):\n哇，多棒的回答。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:47):\n我喜欢这个的地方在于，它结合了二维矩阵和印度神话。这就像是你的缩影，哲学和科技的结合。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:58):\n所以我很喜欢，而且你的思维会往这个方向走也很合理。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:02):\n这还让我想到，我很久以前读过Jim Collins的一本书，《从优秀到卓越》或者他早期关于领导力的书之一，他讲到了我认为是第五级领导力。第五级领导者是那种不以自己为中心，而是以业务为中心的人，他们可以在未来消失，而事情仍会运转良好。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:19):\n对。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:20):\n我觉得如果你相信你的身份需要有自己的地位和遗产，这是很难的，因此很多时候追逐地位会造成破坏，因为你会说\"哦，这上面没有我的签名。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:37):\n因此，接受这个信仰并试图成为它的教皇或神父，要好过试图说\"哦，我需要有我自己版本的信仰。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:50):\n这就是创造性破坏开始发生的地方。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:54):\n有意思。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\n所以你说在Krishna和Rama之间有一个很好的平衡。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:59):\n你能总结一下他们在那个二维矩阵中的位置吗?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:02):\nRama是高价值观、高服从性，Krishna是高价值观、低服从性，但他们都是高价值观，这意味着他们会遵循dharma，并且会切换立场。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:17):\n例如，比如说Satya在OpenAI危机期间扮演了Krishna，把事情解决了，但他会切换回Rama，继续扩大规模。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\n太棒了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\n最后收尾一下，你觉得他们实际上是在思考这些并且很虔诚，还是说这只是在印度成长过程中的氛围，是文化的一部分?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\n这是个好问题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\n我不认为他们有意识地思考这个，但我认为如果他们听到这个，他们会同意，因为那是他们成长的环境，价值体系是更长期的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:51):\n例如，我相信人类所有的不良行为都来自于短期思维，而长期思维是一个重大选择。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:04):\n很多时候很多人会争论说，我们有95%的包办婚姻和低于1%的离婚率，这来自于这种长期思维，人们通过价值观而非吸引力或欲望等来结婚。他们更注重长期，关于建立家庭、建立价值观。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:31):\n或者说低离婚率是关于\"我们会一路修复\"，而不是试图说\"我需要进化\"和\"我需要向前走。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:38):\n所以我认为对那种心态的长期关注，这就是为什么一些文化能持续数千年，因为每个人都更需要长期思维而非短期。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:52):\n美国现在很需要这些。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:55):\n你提到了一个有趣的事实，在印度，大多数创业公司都会失败。你说，我想，经典的数据是90%，而且创业然后失败的风险要高得多。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:08):\n你能谈谈这有什么影响吗?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:11):\n人们如何试图避免这种情况?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:12):\n因为如果你能降低创业的风险那会很棒，还是说这就是会发生的，然后人们会负债累累?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:20):\n我认为长期导向的社会天然更加规避风险。而且不是所有优秀的CEO都能成为优秀的创始人，原因也是一样的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:32):\n事实上，我会说，如果你曾经是一个优秀的CEO，这实际上会让你很难成为创始人，因为你已经变成了这个维持者，而不是破坏者或创造者。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:45):\n我谈论的细微差别是，当你考虑风险偏好时，印度正在改变，但现在我们第一次看到创始人受到尊重和讨论，这些独角兽公司被庆祝，我们的总理公开谈论创业公司。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:02):\n我们有全国创业日等等。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:04):\n所以我认为这方面已经发生了变化，但让我们理解核心的人类行为。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:11):\n印度仍然有大量的包办婚姻。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:16):\n如果你是一个创始人，一个失败的创始人，你找到结婚对象的机会仍然很难。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:26):\n所以如果这都是真的，那么承担风险的意愿就会受到限制。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:32):\n有人给我举了一个有趣的例子，印度有一家非常大的消费品公司，假设你在那里做从0到1的项目，CEO在四五年后换了，你的从0到1项目失败了，但你是最优秀的人，所以才给你这个从0到1的项目。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:49):\n新CEO会问：\"那你过去五年做了什么?\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:52):\n他说：\"什么都没有。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:53):\n我只是尝试推出它但失败了。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:55):\n你既没有在公司得到晋升，新公司也不会说\"天哪，我要雇用这个人才。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:00):\n所以那个留在这个CPG公司稳定品牌的人不断成长，但那是有自然顺风的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:07):\n他所要做的就是在那个品牌上什么都不做。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:10):\n然后突然你会看到他或她做得很好，而这个做从0到1的人却没做好。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:16):\n所以作为一个国家，我们还没有庆祝冒险者。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:21):\n我认为我们会改变这一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:23):\n我认为它已经在改变了，但我们还有很长的路要走。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:27):\n我经常谈到的一件美好的事情是，我曾经在葡萄牙，我看到，我不知道你是否去过并看到过这个，但在教堂里，通常只有皇室被允许埋葬或火化。只有一个其他类别被允许——探险家。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:47):\nVasco da Gama，所有这些探索世界、冒险并推动国家前进的人，被赋予了与皇室相同的地位。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:55):\n所以当我们给予冒险者最高地位时，国家会欣赏这一点，因为最终我们都在寻找社会认可的标志。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:05):\n超级有趣。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:06):\n我想继续谈论印度以及它的不同之处，特别是关于这个市场可能让人们感到惊讶的地方，无论是在那里创业还是如何打造在印度成功的产品。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:15):\n我在另一个采访中看到，你谈到DAU和ARPU之间有很大差异。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:50):\n我收集信息的方法主要是这样的：我会在脑海中形成一些猜想，然后到处去寻找证据，看看我说的是否正确。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:04):\n比如，我最近提出了一个猜想：历史上所有靠恶习生意成功的人，都会做大量慈善来为自己树立良好形象，从而让自己被视为受人尊敬的公民，而不是一个靠恶习发财的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:24):\n然后我让 GPT 列出 50 个这样做的人，以及他们的恶习是什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:30):\n他们是如何通过大量慈善等方式改变自己的声誉的？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:36):\n然后事情就发生了。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:37):\n我会朝着各个方向去研究。我没有边界限制，无论是化学、物理还是人类行为，我都会去探索，寻找一些普遍性原则。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:48):\n所以我的学习方法是：不断从你已经连接的点中提出猜想，然后拼命去寻找证据，再用这些证据去连接下一个点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:01):\n所以我经常告诉别人，你读的每一本书都会让你的大脑变得更\"贫瘠\"，去读下一本书。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:10):\n这就是书籍的意义，但这对我们学习的每一件事都是如此。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:13):\n它会让我们的大脑变得更\"贫瘠\"，去学习下一件我们应该学习的东西。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:57:17):\n最近有没有这样的例子，让你对某个话题特别着迷？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:20):\n这就是我的日常生活。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:22):\n我时不时就会被某个话题吸引。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:26):\n比如，我一直在思考 AI 的二阶效应，以及对国家和就业的影响，如何预测这些事情的变化、不变化、变化速度、技能变化速度。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:39):\n我最近还痴迷于思考，如果实验室培育钻石规模变大会发生什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\n会不会摧毁钻石产业？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\n还是会让钻石产业变得更大？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:46):\n然后我去寻找类似的例子。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:48):\n在养殖珍珠出现之前，珍珠产业非常庞大。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:53):\n养殖珍珠出现后，珍珠的高地位消失了，因为每个人都能拥有珍珠。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:59):\n但在不久之前，珍珠还是非常皇室的东西。每位王子和公主都会佩戴珍珠，但一旦它可以在实验室里轻松制造，就失去了价值。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:13):\n所以我就在想，我应该做空还是做多钻石，思考会发生什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:19):\n但会有一个短暂的时期，实验室培育钻石会赚很多钱，这会……它会像寄生虫一样依附于钻石的地位，然后摧毁所有的利润池。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:31):\n你们第一次听到这个消息，是时候买一些钻石期货了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:35):\n我感觉世界上没有人比你更受 ChatGPT 的影响了，考虑到你有多想花时间深挖各种随机话题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:43):\nLenny，我经常想，如果你把那些最严肃的人的 GPT 搜索记录公开，很多人会从中学到东西，因为 GPT 的问题在于，它现在会让那些提出好问题的人做得更好，而不是那些寻找基础答案的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:00):\n所以我认为这个世界对那些会提出好问题的人会变得不公平。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:05):\n有意思。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\n那我得问你，关于提出好问题，你有什么建议吗？这对你的工作、职业和生活有帮助吗？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:14):\n当某人有很多选择，但他们在任何领域都做出了正确的选择时。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:21):\n比如说，你可以雇佣任何人，但你雇佣了优秀的人；或者说你可以和任何人结婚，但你娶了/嫁了一个很好的人，等等。每个人都有很多选择要做。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:32):\n他们是如何在那个专业领域做出选择的？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:38):\n我认为这是最重要的，而且很多时候他们无法解释自己是如何做出好选择的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:43):\n他们必须真正深入思考，因为他们并没有真正理清自己的思维模型。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:49):\n他们无法表达，无法指导，无法解释。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:51):\n但如果你能弄清楚他们在任何工作领域中是如何做出好决策的，你会发现很多有趣的洞察。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:01):\n另一个好问题是关于二阶思维。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:06):\n他们认为世界会发生什么，以及他们是如何得出这个结论的？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:11):\n你会看到这整个思维链条是非常强大的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:15):\n比如，二阶思维被认为是预测某人成功的最强大特质。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:22):\n但我经常想知道，那些擅长二阶思维的人在童年时期发生了什么。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:30):\n这个问题还没有被完全发现或讨论。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:34):\n我找到了一些粗略的例子，比如你玩策略游戏还是只玩体育游戏，与培养二阶思维有很强的相关性。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:42):\n严谨性来自体育游戏，但二阶思维来自小时候玩策略游戏。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:48):\n如果两者都有，你通常会做得很好，因为你同时拥有纪律性和二阶思维。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:55):\n那你有没有研究过历史？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:01):\n比如，我推荐父母和孩子一起做的一件事，我称之为\"Whyfi 学校\"，就是每顿饭问他们一个\"为什么\"的问题，让他们第二天带着答案回来。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:15):\n比如，\"人类为什么佩戴珠宝\"，\"为什么某些东西是这样的？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:23):\n让他们深入历史去寻找答案。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:29):\n为什么在超级碗做广告这么贵？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:32):\n等等。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:33):\n你只需要一个问题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:34):\n如果你用\"为什么\"来训练他们，他们会以完全不同的速度进化，因为\"如何\"、\"什么\"这些问题不会以那么高的速度进化，因为\"为什么\"是深层次的问题，它会打破你脑海中的很多东西。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:48):\n或者问一些关于起源故事的问题，比如\"电梯是如何诞生的？\"\"是什么让你的手机出现的？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:54):\n\"麦克风是怎么产生的，为什么叫 microphone，为什么叫 phone？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:59):\n如果你想深入这个层面，你会看到人们会自动建立二阶思维，因为要么你深入历史，二阶思维就会随之而来，要么你玩那些训练你大脑进行二阶思维的游戏。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:13):\n但这是一个广泛的范围，我认为人们应该问这些问题。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:17):\n我期待 Kunal 的育儿书，比如一本帮助你养育孩子的书。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:23):\n这可能是你的未来。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:24):\n我没有孩子，所以我可以在别人的孩子身上做实验。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:27):\n这是一件很棒的事情。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:29):\n我觉得对于这些问题，规则应该是你不能只是问 ChatGPT 要答案，如果这样的话——\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:34):\n其实这样也不错。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:36):\n我认为你应该鼓励这样做，因为我们必须假设我们现在都将成为 AI 的副驾驶。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:42):\n你要做的是得出二阶洞察：\"好的,这是真的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:46):\n在其他地方哪里有类似的情况？\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:49):\n给我一个在其他地方发现的例子，等等。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:54):\n太棒了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:55):\n好的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:56):\n在我们进入非常激动人心的快问快答环节之前，我还有几个问题。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:00):\n首先，让我们来到逆向思维角。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:03):\n我很好奇。\n\n有什么是你坚信但很少有人会同意你的观点？你为什么持有这个信念？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:12):\n我们对财富的理解，对什么是财富的理解，是有缺陷的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:16):\n对我来说，财富不过是能量的储存。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:20):\n因此，财富不是零和游戏的原因是因为能量不是，我们只是在寻找将能量转化为我们优势的方法。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:28):\n我们是唯一成功将所有形式的能量转化为我们优势的物种。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:32):\n动能、燃料、声能和太阳能。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:35):\n没有其他物种做到过这一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:37):\n因此，自工业革命以来，我们的财富就这样飞速增长，并持续保持这种势头。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:42):\nAI、核裂变以及所有这些东西会把我们带到那里。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:47):\n所以我有一个强烈的观点，那就是我们永远、永远不会实现财富平等。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:55):\n事实上，追求那个其实是个坏主意。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:58):\n但如果你让人们做得好并追求财富，他们会有足够的财富惠及其他所有人，我们可以帮助很多人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:06):\n我认为这很复杂，因为我们可以有各种民主论点说财富集中之类的，但那就是财富的物理规律。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:16):\n它永远会是集中的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:18):\n你可以改变这些媒介、公司、国家。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:23):\n对我来说，财富不过是一种熵的复杂性，会不断改变其形式和形态。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:29):\n你可以不断与之抗争，或者接受它的物理规律并从中获益。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:34):\n我觉得 Elon 有一个有趣的观点，财富就是一个数据库，每个人的财富就是数据库里的一行，这里记录着每个人有多少，你只是在转移数字，这就是整个经济。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:49):\n不，但重要的细微差别是，你实际上可以无限增加数据库的大小。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:54):\n确实如此。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:55):\n因此他关于太阳能的愿景，如果你真的把所有能量都转化为我们的优势，我们将为人类创造的财富数量是不成比例的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:04):\n所有那些设法合作和协作创造财富的物种，比如说，让我们把财富定义为生物量。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:12):\n所以说蚂蚁、细菌和人类是这个星球上拥有最大生物量的少数几种生物，因为我们弄清楚了如何让能量为我们服务。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:23):\n哇。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:24):\n我喜欢我们谈到的所有这些方向。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:27):\n可能最后一个问题，你职业生涯中有什么失败的故事值得分享吗？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:34):\n教会你重要一课的事情？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:36):\n这是一系列的失败。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:39):\n我认为任何在人生中做过事情的人都无法逃避大量的失败，就像每天、每件事。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:46):\n但我想说，我推出的许多项目、许多产品、我建立的公司都彻底失败了，招聘失败了，信任破裂了，被背叛了。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:01):\n所以我认为这是没有尽头的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:04):\n但我认为创业者有这种奇怪的能力，能够忘记失败，几乎把它转化为你保留的教训，然后你就忘记了那个故事。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:21):\n比如说，COVID 对我来说几乎没有记忆。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:24):\n我就是不记得 COVID 是什么了。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:27):\n在我脑海中现在就是一片空白。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:30):\n我认为人类很擅长忘记失败的记忆，但会记住从失败中得到的教训。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:36):\n但我认为我在不断学习，我常常相信生命太短暂，不能把所有错误都自己犯一遍。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:43):\n所以我们也应该从别人的失败中学习。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:46):\n很多时候我们不这么做，因为我们相信自己很特别，那样的事不会发生在我们身上，但作为人类，我们应该学习。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:55):\n我想说我的人生就是从失败开始的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:58):\n我的家庭经历了严重的财务危机。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:01):\n我不得不从15岁开始工作，直到今天，我感觉自己只是在试图逃离家里发生的那次失败。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:10):\n所以我认为我们中的许多人只是在与最初经历的那次重大失败作斗争，不想再靠近那种境况。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:21):\n虽然我们已经离那很远了，但感觉还是一样的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:27):\n这又回到了我们最开始几个问题之一，肩上的芯片驱动着很多动力。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:33):\n有句话说，\"肩上的芯片带来口袋里的筹码。\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:39):\n这很有意思。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\n是的。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\n关于你遇到的那个早期挑战，你还想分享更多吗？还是这是你经常分享的事情？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:46):\n不，我的意思是我已经分享得够多了，但我以前不太谈论这个，因为我以前觉得这样会获得一些同情。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:54):\n只是在最近我才开始谈论它，因为我想让人们意识到，我不是什么有天赋的孩子，有富裕的父母让我变得异常聪明，把我送进很好的学校和大学，然后我就这样成功了。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:12):\n我以前不谈论这个，因为有很多人倾向于同情那些说\"哦，这个人曾经挣扎过\"的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:17):\n我不想因为打贫困牌或这张牌或为食物挣扎牌而获得任何赞誉。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:29):\n那不是借口。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:32):\n世界上有很多人做得非常好，因为他们有挣扎的礼物。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:37):\n我经常告诉人们，这是成功父母最大的诅咒，那就是他们无法给予孩子的唯一礼物，就是他们曾经拥有的挣扎的礼物。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:46):\n哇。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\n我经常想这个问题。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\n我们有一个孩子，现在八个月大，所以我正在试图找出挣扎与让生活轻松美好之间的平衡，这对我来说是一个新的挑战。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:57):\n在我们进入非常激动人心的闪电问答之前，Kunal，还有什么你想分享的或留给听众的吗？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\n任何事？\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\n最后的思想nuggets？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:04):\n嗯，我希望来自不同产品领域的听众能够分享你正在学习的东西，不要害怕同行的评判，因为有很多很多人只是因为你分享了你的进化和你的想法而在学习。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:22):\n我相信可以有更多人做出贡献。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:25):\n你的很多听众都是真正聪明的人。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:28):\n如果他们都分享，世界各地许多地方的许多人都会学习并取得一定的成功。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:38):\n多亏了你的分享。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:39):\n太棒了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:40):\n说到这里，我们已经到了非常激动人心的闪电问答环节。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:43):\n准备好了吗？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:45):\n准备好了。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:46):\n开始吧。\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:47):\n第一个问题，你最常向别人推荐的两三本书是什么？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:53):\n这一直在变化，但我的书通常是关于理解人类行为的。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:58):\n我会根据不同的人不断改变，但我认为这是最重要的主题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:03):\n我们所有的客户、所有的投资者、所有的员工、所有的关系都是人类。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:08):\n而我们最薄弱的学科就是人类行为。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:11):\n我们如何度过这一生？\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:13):\n如果你不学习人类行为，我们就是在用极其困难的模式玩人生。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:17):\n所以我会说这是一点。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:19):\n第二件事，进化生物学，教了很多关于物种如何进化、如何做决定以及驱动每个人的核心动机是什么。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:28):\n所以这是我推荐的另一个。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:30):\n我不想做推荐，因为老实说我几乎读不完一本书。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:36):\n所以我相信漂流并深入研究主题。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:39):\n所以理解主题，而不是试图说，给我这三本书，我就会变好。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:43):\n最后一个我想说的是，任何能让你学到他们旅程而不是他们成功的东西。\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:53):\n所以有时候自传在某些方面过于庆祝性，但如果你能理解……任何能详细教你人们如何从挫折中恢复的书都是值得学习的好书。",
