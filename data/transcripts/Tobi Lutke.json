  "en": "Tobi Lütke (00:00:00):\nYour podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders, what is your energy source? My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. There are so many books are about this ... Technology leading to dystopia. Like no one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today. I think today is the dystopia of the future. It behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that leads in ... Towards progress.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nThere's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. \"If most people are doing it a certain way I by default don't want to do it that way.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (00:00:34):\nThere's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do, usually without an accent. They usually have a stick and show dramatically at the chart that is behind them. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with outperformance? Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Optimism always sounds dumb or at least naive. The most powerful unquantifiable things in the word of business are fun and delight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nI don't know of any other company that operates where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:11):\nI talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot, right? It's like what would we want to have done 20 years ago on this? We have very long-term plans. At 100 years you can't talk about this software project but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically, to make entrepreneurship more common.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nIs there anything you want to leave listeners with?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:37):\nI really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. Reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:54):\nToday my guest is Tobi Lütke. Toby is a man who needs no introduction so I'm going to keep this very short and get you right to this jam-packed conversation.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:04:24):\nI'm glad to be here. I'm excited for our conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):\nI've listened to so many of your other interviews, I've talked to a bunch of people that work for you. I want to try to do something a little different. There's basically two themes that emerged over and over and over as I've listened to you share advice, and interview, and in talking to people that work for you. One is thinking from first principles, the other is maximizing human potential. I'm just going to plant these seeds for now. I'm going to not ask about these directly, I'm going to come at these from the side with the many questions that I have for you. Something that I've heard people describe at Shopify called the Tobi tornado.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:01):\nOh, wow. Okay, that's a start. I like it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\nWhat is the Tobi tornado?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:08):\nA Tobi tornado, I would say, is a whole lot of change management or a conversation or conflict or real talk compressed into a very short timeframe. I see something it doesn't ... It's not good, I have a conversation. I have learned something very quickly about hey, I need to update my priors, or cool, let's do it differently. At which point a project might be stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of a product. And everyone who's currently on the team, of that particular project, is no longer on the project but they are the founders of the next version which is built differently. And that might be a bit whiplashy for people. I mean, I certainly hope that's true, it's certainly what people tell me. It's also what they appreciate about the company. It's like what is best ends up mattering a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:08):\nBasically, it's you going into a chat room being like \"Hey, this\" ... \"We're going to end this project we're\" ... \"Let's try something else\" because you've discovered or realized this is a bad idea. Some people complain about this practice of like \"Oh, Tobi kills the we've been working on.\" My lens is, you realize we're just wasting time on this thing that is not going to work and we shouldn't do it. Is there anything there along those lines?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:06:32):\nNo. This is everything. Again, once I imagine something might be not the right thing to work on I'm either incorrect at which point this is super important that I understand why or I'm correct at which point it's super unfair for letting people work on something that isn't going to make it. There's a third wave which is I could also ignore it but that's an abjection of my CEO and founder responsibility that I'm absolutely not willing to make so that's just not a path forward that I see valid. I understand that's what a lot of people choose to do. So yeah, compressing time is important. We have a fairly limited time in our careers, right? Our careers are not that long. If you're lucky you have 40 years in the industry. Most people spent more time in school and then maybe leave later if they're so lucky that they can. So it's not even that.\n\n(00:07:33):\nI think you want to do the maximum amount of things you can be proud of at the end of your career. When you look back you want to be saying, \"Hey, holy shit, we shipped this thing which was absolutely an incredible contribution to a mission I cared about at a company that was full of other people who cared as much as I did.\" And also are very proud of working. And maybe even thinking of working with me and being really, really glad that we spent time on projects together. Yeah, none of this happens if everyone's sort of optimizing a thing that probably shouldn't be there, right? And, therefore, I think it's the better thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:16):\nAnd, by the way, I love this way of describing ... Of compressing it in time to just make a decision, not focus on making it come across the most kind, nicest, sweetest way. When you give feedback to people when something is not the way that you think it could be or as good as you could be it's often very direct and often hard to hear. To me this comes across as you're trying to maximize their potential, you're trying to push them to do something better. Is there anything there that you think is a way of approaching feedback?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:08:49):\nI really, really, really think that there is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential. I just think everyone is way, way, way, way, way better than they think. And the reason why we're not performing at this level is a series of ideas, maybe certain approaches for cultivating our skills and our crafts that have not yet been discovered and, therefore, we could not take advantage of them. It's an environment that just narrows the focus on fairly unambitious things at which point you get stuck competing with literally everyone else in the world because everyone's unambitious.\n\n(00:09:33):\nI have found that reminding people of their own potential constantly is actually a wonderful thing to do. And I have a history of being right about people's potential more than they are themselves. Now, in a way, this dooms me fairly often to be disappointed, right, in myself. By the way, I'm talking about myself here too. I think I have way more potential than what I bring to bear and I hate that so I'm trying to cultivate the skills that I need for tomorrow and constantly challenge myself. I'm harder on myself than on anyone else. By some discount rate act equally to the people around me, especially the ones who just so, obviously, are brilliant.\n\n(00:10:23):\nSpending time and longer time in careers with people and then holding them to a high standard means that they accomplish very often things that just they didn't imagine they could. To me this is the most wonderful thing to see. And frankly this is a throughline for all of my career because this ... My product is that. I want my product to cause people to be more successful than they thought they could. And, in fact, become more ambitious about what they are building with their online stores and their businesses than they are actually initially set out to do.\n\n(00:10:56):\nBecause something like this happened to me, right? I started a snowboard store at some point. I didn't set out to build Shopify. If you are committed to following your curiosity as to the next step, and optimize for maximum amount of learning when you choose these steps, it takes you from one place to another and you actually realize the world's full of lies about human potential and progress. Maybe people are not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it. School teaches you that you have to learn this particular piece of math in this 12 month period, and it doesn't matter how much you understand it. It's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which has nothing to do with anything I've ever seen or learned or see ... Or witnessed about how to actually learn things. You follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth. In a way Shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction. I've just seen this to come to be true. And, of course, hearing from someone that you respect that \"Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you and I expected\" ... \"I think the next time this happens in your career you should go path A because\" ... \"Based on your conviction.\" And, therefore, that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right? What I love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to the actual potential rather than sort of their current level plus or ... Plus some, I don't know, a little bit extra.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here. The example of the school is such a pertinent one. To me right now we're looking at preschools for our son and I'm ... They're describing their education philosophy I'm like, I don't know why I should believe this is the right approach. And it makes me just want to spend all this time researching what education approach works. I know it's just preschool and maybe not as critical yet.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:13:38):\nDid you have a bet yet? I have three kids too and this is sort of a decision that every parent faces, right? So many of your listeners are probably product managers of machine learning products that maybe this resonates. So there's a funny thing about machine learning which you're just like ... You train on a lot of data, and, hopefully, you get something that predicts the thing you want it to predict correctly out of it. The biggest problem of this is overfitting, right? What does good look like, a loss function? Which is a heuristic because it's not the actual task that the thing will do in the future it's something that proxies to the task that you want the thing to do in the future. Predict fraud, predict the next word, whatever. So overfitting is basically model learning how to cheat on the benchmark or on the fitness function.\n\n(00:14:39):\nSo there's a business analogy of this which is that ... It's called Goodhart's law. It's literally the same thing as overfitting just for businesses. Goodhart's law just says, \"Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric.\" Same exact thing. The universal truths are things that almost any competitive field will invent for itself by different terminology often. And I think this is also, by the way, why it's so interesting to focus on personal growth and learning a lot about a lot because you end up finding these sort of hidden harmonies behind things, the things that are clearly enduring correct insights. So overfitting, Goodhart's law are the same thing. School optimizes for what? Marks supposedly, right? In fact, overfitting in school is literally the kids cheating to get marks, right? You get another analogy. What is however the right loss function for children? Have you made a decision yet?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):\nNo, I have not we just started down this path. You told me-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:15:55):\nIt's the kind of thing [inaudible 00:15:57]. You have to actually go fairly deep in philosophy to figure this out. And then again afterwards you can build, you can find the schools that you like. For us it was just maintaining curiosity. This is a completely different goal from being good at marks. But I just think everyone's born extremely curious and school has a habit of getting it out of kids. Literally, there's a foundation model of a child, and you fine-tune it at school, and it just loses the neurons of curiosity because it's actually discouraged to meander into other topics and explore them just because they're interesting. I don't know. This is sort of not the beat of a podcast but I just think about this a lot. It's funny how these things just recur constantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\nSo when Archie was on the podcast, he's the head of growth at Shopify ... I don't know if that's his official role. Basically drives a lot of the growth. He talked about how the core product team, outside of the growth team, operates without KPIs, without specific goals. And decisions are driven by taste and intuition primarily you, and Glen, and some other leaders. And a lot of people heard that and they're like \"I\" ... \"First, I don't believe that. Second of all, how does one operate that way when there's no data to tell us exactly what is right and good?\" So the question I have is just how does one operate in that way successfully? What does it take for a company to work that way because a lot of people will try it and fail?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:17:25):\nThis is very close to what I just talked about before with [inaudible 00:17:28]. Goodhart's law is real. The moment a metric becomes a goal it's no longer a useful metric, right? I think that's more or less a precise wording. Why? Because no metric by itself is a complete heuristic for a complex business because business are complex. There's a million of different tensions in a company and you can't all keep them in harmony by optimizing for one fix. It's true that we don't have KPIs and we don't have at least OKRs in the Silicon Valley sense but we are extremely data-informed. We have invested enormous amounts of money and time into systems that give us basically everything at our fingertips. I sent this demo to other founders and they're completely bowled over by the way we can dig into basically every constituent atomic bit part that makes up the cohort that just got formed 15 minutes ago by the end of a ... At the end of a quarter or month or week.\n\n(00:18:39):\nIn a lot of different places, this is one of them but also in its products, it's just not overfitting for the quantifiable. Everyone competes for everything but it's highly quantifiable because it's ... It's fun, it's like a game. You tweak a number and 0.1 more is better than 0.1 less. That's an immediate gratification thing. But I just think the overlap of most valuable things you can do with a product, and for things that happen to be fully quantifiable, it's like maybe 20% which leaves 80% of a value space unaddressable by the people who will only look at quantifiable things. Shopify is comfortable with the unquantifiable things such as tastes, quality, passion, love, hate. It's with the strong emotions that people have.\n\n(00:19:49):\nThe sort of deep satisfaction that a craftsperson feels when they've done a job well is actually better proxy if you allow it to be then the ... Do a unit test pass. A unit tests might not pass. And the unit tests will pass 15 minutes later because we already fix them or adjust the one or two things so they support us. We have systems that tell us exactly if something goes the wrong way. There's an extremely sophisticated rollout system in Shopify that forever holdouts and correlates everything with everything for ... In every experiment and so on and so on and so on. But if you think about it as a cockpit for a pilot. The decisions are still made by pilots and we think this leads to better results. It's just the same with our product. There's plenty of A/B testing tools and all these things for commerce, and it's, of course, really important to figure out what your conversion rates are. But are you representing your brand is an unquantifiable question? Are you proud of the thing that you have built? Do you feel it's your own, right?\n\n(00:21:03):\nAnd so I think there needs to be more acceptance in businesses or for unquantifiable things. The most powerful, not unquantifiable things in the world of business are fun and delight. If people have fun when they're doing something that is just upstream from so ... Sorry, downstream from so many other things. I think that if all the metrics are pointing down but everyone says, \"My God, I'm having so much more fun,\" I think that the very next thing that will happen with some time delay is all metrics will start going up. And if that doesn't happen then we adjust course.\n\n(00:21:51):\nThe reason why we specifically don't have OKRs and these things is because ... If you want to hold the unquantifiable as things that are stable and exist ... That people actually do really defer to them and really actually learn to be okay with someone just saying, \"Hey, this is actually just really great and they're shipping this\" then you need to make certain edits to a business that don't remind everyone too much of the companies they might have come from which the only way to get promoted is by driving the metric up. It's a bit of a [inaudible 00:22:24] conversation I suppose. Good on the fortune cookies saying, \"Shopify doesn't do OKRs or doesn't do metrics\" and so on. But it's actually just because the metrics take us [inaudible 00:22:37] function where we often defer to just more ... Sometimes a little bit emotional but generally less quantifiable things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):\nI imagine if someone were to hear you describe this of focus on joy, and fun, and love, and delight, maybe ... It's easy to dismiss that.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:22:58):\nIt sounds completely idiotic, right? Again, there's an aesthetic in the world that exists which is that business people dress in suit and tie, they are speaking much more sophisticated than I do usually without an accent, have a full head of hair. They talk about metrics, they are in front of PowerPoint presentations, they usually have a stick and show dramatically at the pie chart that is behind them. And highly charismatic, highly ... So that's our aesthetic. How much is that aesthetic overlapped with our performance? I don't know but some of them ... Some people pull it off who are like this. I think the world is sort of stacked to lead us astray based on our stories about what optimal looks like are just so incorrect in so many ways. Optimism always sounds dumb, or at least naive. Pessimism sounds extremely sophisticated. Metrics driven sounds extremely sophisticated. Talking about fun sounds like naive.\n\n(00:24:14):\nWell, first of all, I've always ignored what people think generally. That came pretty natively to me somehow which I'm very lucky about. But I've now actually learned that almost all of the alpha in the world is now in the ... Exactly the things that are unobvious but true. And the things that people dismiss as naive or so. The most successful business person on planet Earth is Elon and he conforms to no idea of what the most sophisticated business person ought to be like in any which way you can imagine. I think we live in a world where the counterfactuals are winning because our ... Because aesthetics are just leading us astray.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThis is an awesome segue to the other theme that I wanted to spend some time on which is thinking from first principles, Elon is the classic example of that. Honestly, I think you're the other most classic example of that these days. And we'll keep talking about all the ways you operate very differently from other companies which are examples of this. But I want to read a quote from Glen Coates, he shared with me, of how he sees you that gives an interesting lens into your first principles thinking. So here's what he said about you. \"Tobi is at his heart a true futurist, he's obsessed with the way things should be in the future. Being data-driven is innately being anchored in the way users and technology are behaving today. He's never really said this to me explicitly, but knowing him I think any design that is drawn primarily from the way things are or were is one that he sees as inferior to one that is skating to the puck of the way things could or should be.\" Does that resonate?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:25:55):\nYeah. I mean, I think that's correct. That's actually really interesting. Your podcast is a podcast by a-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:26:01):\nYour podcast is a podcast by a builder for other builders. Here's the most interesting question I think people can ask builders is like, \"What is your energy source? Where are you getting energy from?\" I think fundamentally the world exists at room temperature. Almost all companies are running at that, humming along, doesn't do anything. There are certain individuals who can inject heat into businesses. Founders do this very well. All the startups anyone's ever heard of have people who are injecting heat because if no one would inject heat into the business, at room temperature, you cannot outperform anyone else. You can't be hotter than everyone else if no one's injecting heat into the concern. So fundamentally, there is a injection of energy into companies that comes from founders and the best leaders, like all the people you've had on the podcast from Shopify have a perfect set of cast of characters of people who are just exothermic. They are just like wellsprings of energy that leads to all the amazing results that we get to enjoy.\n\n(00:27:21):\nSo the question is where does energy comes from? And that's another one of our discussions which very quickly goes into the emotions. Actually, there's a really... So I watched The Last Dance, the Netflix special of Michael Jordan a while ago, of course, but there was one scene where he just, I'm sure this is a super famous story and he just made up an insight that someone told him so that he would then go and just want to destroy them afterwards, which he then of course proceeded to do because it's hard to imagine anyone more exothermic than him. So we know what his energy source is. It's rivalry. It's potentially it's insight or it's anger, something like this.\n\n(00:28:06):\nI am not... My energy source is dissatisfaction with status quo. My fundamental belief is all this talk about technology where all... So many books are about just technology leading to dystopia. You know what dystopia is? Today, compared to what it will be in 20 years ago or any. And you can play this for any part of human history. I'm not making a future statement. I'm making a almost totalical statement about the experience on planet Earth. No one who really thinks about this would want to be born into a world 20 years before today rather than today. And so I think today is the dystopia of future, and I think it behooves us to try to build the kinds of products that lead in towards progress in a small way or a big way. But yes, I think if someone comes to me and says, \"Hey, let's go do this thing. And we've looked around and here's how people solve this problem, let's make a good version of that,\" I'm like, \"That was not the job.\" Because everything that you encounter, that every solution, every product, everything that exists is path-dependent, highly, highly, highly path-dependent, and often path-dependent based on having to make compromises, based on things that were true at the time a decision was made but are no longer true.\n\n(00:29:38):\nThe entire field of... What was it? I forgot the name of a field. Chomsky's field, the linguistic research field. It's cool. We now have autoregressive models that are just like, we don't actually need to set up a complete... We don't need to research the structure of grammar to be able to make machines also engage in the spoken word. We actually can just train on the internet, it turns out. So that was not possible back then because you didn't have the right architecture for this, but now it is. So I think what you have to do is to actually have, when you come up with a new product or you discuss a new product, you have to derive it from first principles. You have to say, \"How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block that we have available right now?\"\n\n(00:30:25):\nFor that, to do that, you actually have to understand the power and the composability of all the building blocks that exist right now, which is a tall order and no one is perfect at this. But so this way, you go ahead and say, \"Okay, cool, so this is how we are implementing this thing. This is how it will be implemented today.\" And now we can talk ourselves in taking shortcuts. \"Maybe we should actually start up doing it the way everyone else does. Maybe we derived exactly what everyone else does as the correct thing to do.\"\n\n(00:30:56):\nSometimes there was a lot more wisdom encoded in the status quo than you expect, which is I think is super delightful. Then you figure that out and so when you act on it. But what isn't okay is skipping the exercise and doing the same thing everyone else does because that is again a abdication of product leadership. And so yeah, I would say I become extremely suspicious if I get a pitch to do a good version of the same thing everyone else does because I just find that in our space specifically very rarely to be the best solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:33):\nThere's a couple quotes along these lines I've seen that describe the way you think about this stuff. \"If most people are doing it a certain way, I, by default, don't want to do it that way. And if you want to do something world-class, you can't do it like everyone else.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (00:31:46):\nYeah. I don't even think that's an opinion that I hold. I think that's actually... We are basically in axiom territory here. If you want to do something better than what exists, you have to do it differently. That does not make a statement about if it will be better in the end after you do it. It could also be worse. But you can't get something better done if you do the same thing. It's like axiomatically not possible to do. It's fails Archimedean logic, yet it's something... You would be amazed how many business plans are actually failing Archimedean logic in this way like, \"Let's do a good version of this thing that we've already been doing and we will capture 1% of the market,\" and just like this stuff. It's like, \"Trust me.\" I find it kind of cute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):\nIs there an example that you can share of you approaching the problem this way? I imagine it's constantly happening. You also mentioned you're born this way. So I think it's hard for someone to just sit down, learn, think the way Tobi thinks, but I'd love to help people start to approach problems this way, so maybe an example might help.\n\nTobi Lütke (00:32:54):\nI think this is entirely learnable, I think. And so I encourage people to just have a practice of think step by step essentially and just do it. It'll become a habit pretty quickly because it just, it also just outperforms.\n\n(00:33:09):\nExamples. The very first example is Shopify itself. It's cool. So there was lots of e-commerce software and it was all the way it was because of path dependence because everyone who want it in 2004, 2005, e-commerce was an existing retailer and therefore they had complex businesses that needed to be ported online, including all of their somewhat Byzantine business logic. \"I wanted to make e-commerce software that would do very well on the internet of the future and I believe that we can make it easier to start new businesses online than it is in a physical world because the physical world is encumbered by a lot of regulations and also upfront costs for leases and so on. So let's optimize for that case and build something that is so intuitive to use that frustrated people in dead-end careers can spend their lunch breaks making progress towards building their own business, which then eventually allows them to do it on their own way.\"\n\n(00:34:25):\nAnd so being fortune was biased, eventually it turns out to be a much better prep for also solving all the enterprise cases because no one had to... Enterprise software is overfit to the sales process, which is that it wins the RFPs because it has every feature ever or at least a way of putting a checkbox next to every RFP line ever. But they're not good, right? An RFP is a great example of overfitting in the world of procurement because it tells you nothing about the quality of software behind it. But honestly, this happens all the time. It is just like here, we are setting the stage for much more, much higher quality retrieval for the products on Shopify and across Shopify. I think we've been in a local maxima on search and we think that, especially with the advances of the new models, certain things are now possible to do that could not have been done yet because again of these layers and layers of path dependence and no one coming and saying, \"Is that the best way to do and maybe we should rebuild this component periodically?\" We can now do a better job if search that will leads to much more delightful experiences. And so this is a fun project that this happening right now in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):\nI think this is really interesting because what I'm looking for is like the Tobi algorithm of first principles thinking. Elon's got these famous ways of thinking he shared. One is start with the cost of metal to help you understand how much a rocket should cost. And then he's got this five-step. First, decide, do we need this thing? Then figure out how to optimize it, then automate it. What I'm hearing so far, and I'm curious if you've thought about this? And if not, this feels like a really good blog post in your futures, the Tobi first principles algorithm, but I'll share a couple of things I've heard so far as you've described it.\n\n(00:36:24):\nOne is analyze the path that existing solution has relied on, almost like the assumptions that were true for it to be built back and it was built. And the other is this overfit, what is it overfit for? What is it over solving that maybe isn't necessary? Is there anything along those lines of just how you approach problems?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:36:43):\nThis is probably too nerdy technical. You are right, but I should figure myself out a little bit. My brain runs on a meter language but isn't directly something I can translate into words, I suppose. I think more about things like this in terms of programming constructs, pure functions, overstate. And I think in any moment, the best decision to do is I think the perfect product lead is almost like a thermostat for high quality product. It's like you're setting, saying, \"I would like to build something really, really great and I'm going to go through a series which is much, much more complex than what a thermostat does,\" which basically checks the temperature and then makes a decision of air con or heating. You make you re-derive literally every decision that is valuable, every foundational assumption, every foundational ABC direction. And you want to see the observation you've made in the meantime since you last derived the next step. Re-running the entire function over the state that is now updated, the higher fidelity information, would you come to the very same thing?\n\n(00:38:08):\nSometimes fairly early in the construct in the tree of foundational assumptions, change is made. An example we all had was beginning of COVID when we suddenly had shelter in place. So Shopify has that incredibly good office spaces and we were very in-person company and we've... Our floor plans because I think we really added something to the understanding of how to put great... I got a lot of founder energy from my co-founder, Daniel, to build great collaborative spaces for creative work with lots of happy accidents, people running into each other and so on.\n\n(00:38:46):\nAnyway, we were very, very, very, very determined on doing that. But somewhere in this construct of nesting functions, you have to rerun and foundational assumptions. It's in the stack is the fairly basic Boolean of are people allowed to leave a house? Which was yes. The moment that flips, it's not that just like, \"Okay, over here let's do the best what we can do.\" It's actually that the entire tree now moves into a different place. And it can be a very far place, different, that you land because you will make the same quality of decision on every step, but you need to rerun something that takes you to a completely different landing zone. And so then this is also easy for us to say, \"Cool, we are going to be remote only forever? Let's go.\" And because we realized that the temporal shelter in place would cause a series of events that would make that for optimal best set of trade-offs for the company. And so I think this is... Can I put this into a piffy five-step? I wouldn't know, but maybe it resonates with someone who can help me figure out the coded English language for this because it has been nerdy way the I explained it, even to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nThis remote work example is something I definitely wanted to touch on, which is I'm glad you got there. So in this decision, is there anything more you could share about how you got to that place of like, \"Oh this Boolean changed so we should rethink this?\" Because I know you probably, you weren't... I don't know. Were you in the shower and just like, \"Oh wow, we should really go remote because of this\"? How did that actually come about? And then I wanted to ask on another part-\n\nTobi Lütke (00:40:27):\nYeah, pretty much actually yes because again, I rerun over all the inputs and figure out what happens. And here's a couple of other things that were starting to fray on the decision to be in person as well. We started in Ottawa, Canada, which is a city of a million people, and it has some tech heritage and good universities. But at a million people, it's just not population dense enough and has a depth of talent pool that it can support a company that is going to 10,000 people. So anyone who runs this optimization function I'm talking about here about location strategy for a new startup will come to the conclusion if they do it right that everyone should be sitting around the same table. Only if you can't do that, do you say, \"Okay, let's be all in the same couple of rooms.\" Only if that doesn't work anymore, you say, \"Okay, let's be spread over one floor.\" If that doesn't work, in the same building. If that doesn't work, in the same city. If that doesn't work, at least stay in the same time zones or make sure that there's good hub connections between.\n\n(00:41:39):\nThis is how it works. It's just like some assumption somewhere along the line is invalidated. You end up in a different side of a decision tree. But what was happening to us was we already were in four or five cities. We were adhering to the same time zone at this point. But my experience was I went through, sometimes at the Ottawa office, through an entire day where I had 10 hours of meetings, which is fairly normal, but I do every single... I don't think I had a single other person sometimes with me because every one of them was with people in another office. Some people are dialing in remote and so on. So there was an awkward hybrid-ness which we ended up in making only good decisions along the way.\n\n(00:42:29):\nThis is actually the most dangerous thing. Most of the time you end up in a bad part of a tree, in a local maxima of a path-dependent environment, by only making good choices. People think that making a good choice inoculates you from making mistakes or that the presence of a downside of an idea ends up disqualifying the idea. Both of those things are incorrect. So what you need to do then is... So that was an overlay to decision.\n\n(00:42:59):\nThe moment COVID started, then we also had this thing of shoppers exploding because we were actually an asset to people during COVID, e-commerce for the local businesses. And we took that very, very seriously trying to make more businesses survive COVID, small businesses survive this particular calamity than otherwise won't which is important because small businesses tend to be wiped out first anytime the times turn fragile. And so we needed to staff up. And so there's a very weird question about where to staff up. So clearly the better input there would be if you could hire people everywhere. And so once that decision flipped, you can see how this is actually now super easy to say, \"We are going to remote,\" because there is no turning back. There is no... Even with this decision, it's a better set of trade-offs for the future is to accept the vast additional difficulty of building a remote company. It's way harder.\n\n(00:44:03):\nIt's not something you should recommend to anyone to do this because it's the same as trying to run a world record marathon run in Aspen, Colorado. It's like there's not enough oxygen up there to do that. But if you end up pulling it off, you're a real Chad. That's very cool. So I find difficulty itself interesting. And again, I spent enough of my teenage years on the internet to know that there's amazing cultures that can be put together purely remote like, I don't know, Wikipedia, World of Warcraft, Raiding Guilds can at least have excellent cultures. And so we are like, \"Okay, cool. Let's come to a new stable part.\" That stable part was don't port the office online. Let's port the internet into a company and then we are like, \"Let's go.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):\nThis episode is brought to you by Loom.

I want to talk about this talent stack concept that you've touched on a couple of times that I think so much. But before we get there, I want to go in a different direction, which I think is an interesting foundational element to your ability to be successful in your first principles thinking, which is you getting to the metal, to the core of the problems you're solving by actually spending a lot of time coding. And I actually heard a story about how you all had this huge all-hands summit. You flew everyone in. You're all together. There was a three-day hackathon. And the way it was described is you're sitting at a table with headphones in, coding, just like any IC engineer. No one would've known you're the CEO of this company, the founder of this company. Why is coding and working in the code to you still so important?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:46:46):\nIt's so funny that that's the way the story goes. It's right, but I don't know why that is surprising. That's my happy place, being able to clear out free days of my calendar and being there till midnight with all these remarkable people who join us on journey, just building stuff. It's like, I do my job so that that is the jobs that exist for other people. That's a job I actually want. That's the one I couldn't find because no one did a company for me. But at least back in most days, I think still not really.\n\n(00:47:26):\nAnd so I just love coding. It's one of the greatest, I don't know, hobbies and pursuits. I've done it for a very long time. I came across it very, very early. It fits my brain like a glove. I appreciate so much of the craft behind coding. I am a trained apprentice in... Sorry, I've apprenticed as a programmer in Germany, which has a dual education system that you can do such things. So I've been professionally in companies spending all day. And I really mean it, programming ever since I just turned 16. I think first day was just before I turned 16 when I started my apprenticeship.\n\n(00:48:18):\nAnd so I love it. I have a view on my screen left of you is a cursor right now, which is opened to a Juniper notebook where I'm working on some projection stuff that I'm playing with. I try to sanity-check as much as I can of what I get. I try to find... It's a game for me to find new insights in data. And I just think, I don't know, it was cool. Maybe this is the picture you talk about. There is a picture that someone captured, which is really fun where I'm on my laptop with a bunch of engineers and then Harley, so president, is on stage DJing. This was taken at 1:00 AM or something like this. It's a picture which actually really precious to two of us because it perfectly summarizes our relationship in a way which these happy accidents are wonderful and these long journeys, I've been doing Shopify for 20 years now, so I appreciate these artifacts. But yeah, so...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\nTo be clear, the reason this is unusual is, and why someone told me this story, is most CEOs do not do this, don't just sit there and code along with the team. And the reason I thought this story was important is and the reason I think your first principle approach works is you're actually in the engineering details, similar to Elon if you think about it, of just in the weeds doing the thing, understanding how the thing works, not just coming up with ideas out of pontifications. And so I guess is there anything there of just how important it is, if you want to approach thinking from first principles, it is to be really close to the metal, to the bare metal?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:50:11):\nWell, yeah. First principles thinking starts from, I think Elon puts it as physics, which I think is a little bit atoms-coded. I think just from the atomic building blocks really is a right starting point. Atomic building blocks are the computers we are using. Computers are our instruments. We use them to create the music that when people appreciate to receive in the form of software. So you've got to understand how they work, at least to work the way I do.\n\n(00:50:48):\nNow, is the way I work optimal? Of course not. This is my point about the aesthetics of how to behave, how to work. I probably don't conform to the traditional view of what the most of public companies should be like or even should spend their time, but I think I'm successful because I don't try to conform to anything other than what I've learned works. And so what I learned works is be in as many details as you can. Really, really, really just understand the stuff that we are making decisions about and be willing to don't put too much stake into the sunk cost fallacy. Try to inoculate business or your parts of a company from a sunk cost fallacy as much as possible because that allows you to just see better solutions and so on.\n\n(00:51:45):\nAnd I think what we were doing, if I remember right, is at hack dates is we were working through pros or cons of just merging all of Shopify into one huge monorepo and we are sketching out directory structures and tooling that we would need, and...\n\nTobi Lütke (00:52:00):\n... tooling that we would need and... Again, monorepo, now for companies, it's a very much one of those door A, door B kind of things. It's a very consequential choice that is incorrect to go say yes to at a certain size, and then it becomes very correct in my mind to say yes to, but at that point it's an enormous amount of effort. So, it's a kind of thing that actually is something I'm uniquely positioned to be involved with because it's actually a business strategy thing as well. That's an investment, a very real investment to say, \"Hey, let's change the way we are building system. Let's figure out what the best way is.\"\n\n(00:52:47):\nThere's going to be change management. There's going to be some people that have very strong opinions on yes or no. And frankly, \"Tobi said so.\", helps. It also compresses a lot of time, because everyone knows the way I book. Everyone can come to me with better ideas about anything, and if you're right, I will change my mind. But I will hold my opinions very strongly until the point of being convinced that they're not the correct ideas. Maybe that's another aspect of this Tobi Tornado thing you talked about earlier, people do fight.\n\n(00:53:27):\nAgain, the aesthetics of our times put a lot of stake into consistency. I remember various politicians losing campaigns because they were called flip-floppers at times, which I... Although, I'm more of a Maynard Keynes school of... \"When the facts change, I change my opinion. What do you do, sir?\" It sounds like a better OS to go by.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:52):\nIt's awesome, because I'm extracting more of your algorithm of how you think about stuff. A few things you just shared are, ( 1.), you need to be in the details. This is thinking about to be successful as a first principles thinker is (B.), you need to be in the details in your case code. In Elon's case, it's like, build the thing and be at the factory, sleeping on the floor. As you said, he's very Adams based. You're more digitally native. And then also, don't be so reliant on some costs. Like you said in this Tobi Tornado case, \"I know you've been working on this project, we're going to kill it, because it's not going to work better if we do that now versus this. Just keep going, because we've been going.\" And then, coming back to the stuff you've shared previously is, analyze the path that you've been on, that the previous products and solutions have assumed the path dependence of them, and then don't look at what they've overfit potentially, that isn't correct. Love it. Okay. This actually is a good segue to something else that someone that you work with suggested I ask you, Farhan, your head of engineering. I asked him, \"What's the best way to get a glimpse into Tobi's mind?\" And it's actually along the lines of what you just described, which is, the question is just, what's the best way to disagree with you?\n\nTobi Lütke (00:55:02):\nI think just disagree with me. I immediately love it, honestly. I really crave it. It's very funny. I know how this really surprises people. And I actually appreciate it even more because it requires courage, and frankly, I actually do find that... But it also makes me immediately trust the person more, partly because I, first of all, think they will do what they think is right rather than what is convenient. Agreeing with a group tends to be much more convenient. But more than that actually, that they're courageous enough to do it right then. I think courage is really, really rare. I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage. I found a lot more maybe even genius than courage. I like that. I wish it wouldn't require that. This is why I try to be very inviting of it.\n\n(00:56:08):\nWhen someone disagrees with me, I tend to immediately stop and say, \"Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement.\" And it's almost never, I find, in the, \"I just feel like we should do this differently.\" What I'm looking for is offer unstated foundational assumptions. What is our divergence point? Because you might be right. In fact, people often are, when it gets to this point, I found. Sometimes it's an unstated foundational assumption that I hold that is incorrect. People tell me and then I'm so glad we talked about it, because I will stop forever nagging on this thing because now I know we can't do it because of Sarbanes-Oxley or something like this. It's just like, \"Well, cool.\" My mental model of Sarbanes-Oxley, which is regulation for public companies, is not perfect. I have not in-depth studied all the details for it, so I will not consult this in my mind when I am saying, hey, we should solve the task at hand in a certain way. So, this is very good.\n\n(00:57:24):\nHow to disagree? I really like debate. I will play devil's advocate actively if everyone agrees on something. Again, especially if a proposal is something that feels like I could have predicted would be a proposal before it got into the meeting and there was nothing surprising in it, I will make myself an end boss of a level and just say, \"I'm going to say this is just not that good. I think we could do way better.\" I want people to then argue more in-depth for the veracity of the decisions, and that leads to a form of disagreement. I think all these things end up building trust.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):\nI like that that touches also on this idea of, again, maximizing potential, the potential of the teams, the potential of the employees\n\nTobi Lütke (00:58:14):\nBecause of course, the really important decisions, we don't talk about. This is the most important thing. Shopify probably makes... What?... millions of decisions every day, like, write this code this way, yes, I'm going to add this unit test, maybe I'm skipping a unit test. Might be the difference between a future production audit. Millions and millions of these tiny decisions. So, you're not hiring engineers primarily or accountants, you're hiring people who make excellent decisions, given their specialization and areas they're overseeing. And given that, decision making as a concept is actually really understudied, I find.\n\n(00:58:59):\nI think these are instances where we can just learn to make decision making together. Because I think while a lot of decisions are made independently, we are a product company, we are on a mission, and we want our product to feel like something that a single person made, in the same way how any author tries to write a book that clearly reads that it came from one mind. Because people can see and spot this, if this doesn't happen. You end up with something that looks like a television remote, where there's a Netflix button over here... It's like you can reverse [inaudible 00:59:41] from the remote control. That's important.\n\n(00:59:48):\nUsing these moments and also bringing decision making inwards to go and say, hey, let's have very efficient opportunities for as many people that can possibly get together, make decisions together, not as a democracy but with clear who needs to convince who. That because otherwise this ends up just taking way too long. Give a opportunity for everyone to change my mind over Glenn's mind, and so on, is an excellent practice, I find. I think this is a more optimal way of going about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nSpeaking of disagreeing, it reminded me of a story I heard, about the Tobi Tornado actually, the way you operate that. I love it. It ends up being this interesting microcosm of your first principle's way of thinking. The story is, I think you've said at one point that the best way to get people to give you insights is to say something they disagree with on the internet.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):\nThat's often the way you approach this is, you post in a Slack group, \"Hey, I don't think this product is going to work, and here's why.\" And that ends up creating the most information for you. Is there anything along those lines that might be helpful to share?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:56):\nI don't think that's one of my better ways of doing that. I have to be somewhat careful. The people I worked with a lot, I will do this, just because it's funny. But even I can see that that would seriously stress out the interns.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nYou guys have a lot of interns. I think you have 1,000 interns this coming year, is what Farhan shared.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:20):\nYeah, we just started. I was in the office yesterday and it's absolutely full of interns. It's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):\nOh, man. Love interns, so much energy. This idea that you shared about building one product, building towards one vision, this actually reminds me of something that came up basically every time I had someone from Shopify on, which is this idea of a 100-year vision that you keep. I don't know of any other company that operates in this way, where the founder has this 100-year vision of where the product needs to go and working backwards from that.\n\n(01:01:48):\nCan you just speak to that, of that way of operating, why you find that helpful, how that actually works?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:54):\nI talk about look in the future and then think backwards a lot. What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this, or 10 or 5 years ago? What's the decision our future selves would want us to make, is useful. I find future casting to be generally extremely valuable. I definitely did not build Shopify to flip. I had lots of opportunities to sell Shopify to various people. I didn't consider it, because it's just too interesting of a journey and I think that's too... If a endpoint [inaudible 01:02:34] all companies is a convergence on a set of four or five people who can afford them, that just creates too much of a monoculture, I think, in thinking.\n\n(01:02:43):\nI like that Shopify is different. I think this is good. I think it's a terrible place to work for many, many, many people. It's the best place in the world to work for some people. That's so good. That's what we want, I think. We want more of this. We want people to be able to window-shop for a place where they can be enormously successful, because the place's set of beliefs just fits you like a glove.\n\n(01:03:14):\n100 years. We have very long-term plans. 100 years, you can't talk about this software product, but you can talk about the mission itself, whatever things that will survive for 80 years that are left on this particular timeframe. Entrepreneurship is just precious. Shopify exists, basically you make entrepreneurship more common. That is the thing we wanted to cause in the world. We have had, I think, success doing this already, but again, there's no speed limit and no stopping point for this. As I keep saying, the word's unbelievably path dependent. And therefore, if we are part of a path, we can cause it to be more in adherence to the things that we value and would like to see. This is the wonderful thing about company building. They can have lasting impact.\n\n(01:04:16):\nWe are making decisions based on all the things that we can do. What are the things that will be most long-term valuable for the long-term pursuits we are on, and how can we normalize entrepreneurship? It's a thing that's really important to me, just because people don't spend enough time on it. It's all economics. Our [inaudible 01:04:44] living entirely depends on businesses. We are all part and tag of an environment that is extremely entrepreneurial and actually celebrates entrepreneurship as a courageous act and a glorious act even.\n\n(01:05:02):\nBut that's not true in most of the world. In fact, most people never encounter anyone who engages in doing that. It's not something people see as one of their options. I want us to make these choices. And I think the long-term focus matters. It's also really powerful for decision making. And I know this is potentially intuitive to most, but also rarely practiced. You've had a lot of people from Stripe on here. Stripe and Shopify have had a very long-term partnership. Stripe and Shopify had potentially the most valuable partnership, or at least one of the top ones in history, of technology, because we were both very small companies and we decided, hey, let's work on an assumption that both of us are going to win our markets, and work together. So, Stripe's [inaudible 01:06:02] for payments and we're allowed a part of Stripe and so on.\n\n(01:06:07):\nWhen you're in a partnership like this, you play basically iterated prisoner's dilemma. Every instance, every turn you can make a choice: coordinate or defect, defecting if the other person collaborates, collaborator effect. If both collaborate, everyone gets a point. If one defects and the other one collaborates, you get a lot of points, all at one moment. Being a good partner in business is like this corporate marshmallow test that companies tend to fail in a very funny way.\n\n(01:06:44):\nIf you see the videos of kids doing actual actual marshmallow tests, the smart ones actually turn the chair around, look away from the marshmallow, and sit on their hands, and just go vibrating. Because they know it's the right thing to wait for getting two marshmallows in the future, but man, if they just look at a marshmallow, they'll just eat it. Most CEOs, most companies can't even successfully do that and just engage in pulling future profits forward at a discount or even defecting on partnerships that would be much more long-term valuable.\n\n(01:07:16):\nIf you're talking about long timeframes, like 100 years, there is no question. But clearly, the correct way to play iterated prisoner's dilemma is coordinate for both sides. It's way more valuable [inaudible 01:07:27] doing that over long periods of time than any momentary defection could possibly be convenient at a moment. It's a huge amount of product decisions. When we are deciding roadmap, end up being very influenced by this, because I get pitches for things we should do and why don't we do this kind of change to the system, there's so much money in it, and all these kind of things. I'm like, cool, but almost always come in a form of putting future profits forward at a discount.\n\n(01:08:08):\nBut we have a long time horizon. Let's not take the discount, let's... Also, you often compromise the entire business after a while because you end up just... Your customers notice if you're going into value extraction. The best companies, I believe, at least from a perspective of a leader, resemble some kind of cockpit, or maybe a room full of dials or levers for monetization. My job is adding as many of these levers as possible to the room, and then not pulling any of them. Because I think we do best if we are on the same side of a table of our customers and we had them become entrepreneurs, which is a mission, and we want to support them to be more successful, which is the business model we are in. We get a very, very small stake of the sales in our monetization system. And therefore, we are incentivized to make everyone as successful as possible.\n\n(01:09:11):\nAgain, when I get a PowerPoint from investment bankers or so, where they tell me I have enormous pricing power and I could massively change the prices, I'm like, \"Yeah, but I'd leave Shopify if that happens to me, so how is that good?\" He's just like, \"Why?\" It just goes like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:30):\nThere's a quote that you wrote somewhere that, to me, identifies this point so succinctly, \"On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack.\" Yeah, beautiful.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:46):\nI think that's pretty piffy and it's also just... Try to argue with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):\nThat's true.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:54):\nPositive-sum games have incredible returns, especially in the worlds of software, where you can experience exponentials very easily. I see company building as... I wish there would be better analogy than chess, because chess is a game of perfect information, which is totally incorrect. But one thing which I like about chess as an analogy for business is that it basically is two games, that you have to be good at at both. There's a positional game that you learn: Develop your pieces, gain influence by your pieces over the board. That's really, really important. And then there's tactics, which you learn tactic training. You go get a puzzle trainer and you drill tactics and you learn the intuition to sports tactics, sense them. Both of them are actually super independent of each other.\n\n(01:10:53):\nThe business world only talks about tactics. It only talks about the conversion of we did this thing. We did an A/B test and we changed the color of blue, and conversion red went up. We lionize the easy hack. I don't think that's important, honestly. You need to be good enough at tactics to not go out of business. You can't get margin code, sure. But the sum total of all the value of a potential tactics that you could employ stays with you if you are actually are doing the positional game.\n\n(01:11:36):\nThe positional game is like, what is the territory on the map that you are taking? What role do you play? How much trust do you have of merchants? Do merchants want more from you or less? Are you the kind of thing they're trying to optimize out of their software spend, or the one that they ask to subsume all other software spend? Do they rely on you? Are you part of a team, or are you used as a tool in the toolbox, usually forgotten, sometimes coming out when certain task is being done? What does your product cover? What industries are you addressing? And so on, so on, so on. This is the positional game. How well do pieces fit together? Do people like relying even deeper on you?\n\n(01:12:25):\nIf you do that well, the tactics are yours and you can hire a lot of people who are extraordinarily good at spotting tactics and using them. But if you do it too much, you end up extracting through tactics the entirety of the value that you have created and that is yours to take through a positional game. And if you do that, you have nothing left in the tank. That's for companies that we all see, that just got to a point and then just fade. Those are the companies that got tacticked out of their position.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\nThe skill, obviously, is finding the balance between these two things of short-term, not get margin calls, as you described, but also think ahead.\n\n(01:13:09):\nIs there any kind of heuristic for founders listening to this who are like, \"How do I do this? How much should I be thinking about the future versus now?\", I guess? How do you try to create this pie chart of driving goals immediately and show investors we're killing it, while also thinking ahead?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:13:22):\nIs there a good heuristic? Objective number one is: Don't die. Again, in the end, for companies that become historic companies are the ones which did not die. It also sounds very basic, but actually it's more actionable than it might seem. Past that point, I would argue: Just focus on the positional game. I think this is where a bit of a discrepancy of the founder and the rest of the company sometimes lies. I think the founders create finite, winnable games for people, that are very much serving the infinite game of developing, that the mission implies, the quality of position on the board.\n\n(01:14:14):\nBy the way, it's an infinite board. Just picture the chess board as the initial terrain, but there's, I don't know, fog on the board and it's a terrain that's much larger that you will explore over time. I think that's the most prettiest way of mentally thinking about the experience of building a company. It's an exploration and a collaborative inquiry into a question that is implied by the mission. And you will get to explore how correct your mission is and how good your decision making is along the way. And you get to learn a lot, and this is why I think it's a valuable thing to do.\n\n(01:14:55):\nBut they often, the founders, and the mission of a company are in alignment, but they are, again, non-quantifiable things. They are pursuits. Maybe as time horizons that go past, all of our time horizons of our careers, therefore that makes it hard for people to care deeply yet. But they do care about the instances, the games along the way, the [inaudible 01:15:24] that have to be done to explore a part of a map, the tactics that have to be executed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:29):\nI'm not going to take us here, but I know you're a big fan of this book, Finite and Infinite Games. I actually had it once at a book club and it blew my mind open. I'm going to link to it. People should check it out. You've talked about this on another podcast. I'm not going to [inaudible 01:15:40].\n\nTobi Lütke (01:15:40):\nYeah, it's a lovely book. James Carse did an incredible, underappreciated... I think they essentially wrote one of the best business books. They is trying to write a hard philosophy book. I don't know if it works for its intended purpose, but I think there's more value in what he actually accomplished. Maybe, sadly, it may be that he didn't know before he died, which would be very sad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):\nIt's a little hard to read for people...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\n... so just stick with it and just try to wrap your head around what he's trying to say, is my advice.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:14):\nI think reading... I don't know how many it is, but... the first couple of chapters really helps you get your arms around the story, his insight. The rest of the book are examples of his ideas applied. My takeaway from reading his examples is that he did not fully appreciate the insight of his own idea. It just ends up being very locally limited and very narrow-focused. It's a much grander idea than I think he really... This is why I say I don't think he fully appreciated quality of his own idea, which...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):\nI think we need a Tobi version of this book, with a foreword, and...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:02):\nI heard Simon Sinek...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):\nUh-huh.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:04):\n... wrote a book of a similar title. I've actually never gotten around to read it, but I think he would be very good at interpreting this if that's what he did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\nThat's what it sounds like. I feel like his book is that book, written in a different way.\n\n(01:17:15):\nI want to come back to something you talked about, which is focusing on entrepreneurship and the merchants that you all work with. To me, this is another example of maximizing human potential. The way I think about this, people always talk about Y Combinator and Stanford and all these places that create all these companies and founders. If you think about it, Shopify does this orders of magnitude beyond, and I don't think you guys get enough credit for that, the amount of businesses you create, the amount of lives you change.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:43):\nThat's because we don't want the credit. That's the point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\nIs there a platform?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:47):\nWe don't want the credit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:47):\nNo.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:48):\nI mean, maybe if you wanted it, you could also not get it, but we don't need to explore that because we actually, literally don't want the credit. Shopify is a company that pushes from behind. We don't want to be written into the story. We want to just...\n\nTobi Lütke (01:18:00):\n... want to be written into the story, we want to just kind of have you do your thing. There's just too much grandeur in wanting to front it all. This is also what caused us to go and help people build their own things rather than start with a marketplace that everyone gets to lease a little component of at prices that corresponds to magically exactly your margin, as this usually goes in marketplaces. And so yeah, I think we don't want it. I'm proud of it, but that's intrinsic. I don't need very extrinsic appreciation for it, I suppose. There's millions, millions and millions of people that use Shopify daily and that represents the business and it causes major amount of employment around the world actually, definitely in North America specifically and Europe. And so I think that's really gratifying. I'm sure there's a way of saying that many of us businesses might actually have existed without Shopify.\n\n(01:19:18):\nI also think you can make a case that a good number exists because of Shopify, because what we've observed is that this was actually, it's my favorite thing in the entire Shopify journey that we sort of rigorously determined, which is that because I really, really, really prioritize good UX, legible interfaces. You can tame enormous complexity with great UX in a way that makes sense to people. I think this is actually almost a moral obligation to do for software because when software goes bad, it makes people feel dumb and machines do not get to negatively influence people in my mind. That is the inversion of the priority of the hierarchy of how machines are tools wielded by people to be more powerful at the things that they're already great at than they might imagine. That's when this all needs to fit together, but beyond the moral point, which is 10 years, and you could definitely take the other side of what we have determined is that every single time we make a complex thing simpler. It is actually that more businesses will exist on a platform.\n\n(01:20:38):\nSo I think this is intuitive or at least directional, but sometimes people are not like, \"Well, don't you just need to have all these features?\" This is the RFP view of a world of software, right? \"Don't you need to just have all the features then people can implement their plan?\" Well, no. Think about the mental state and entrepreneurship entrepreneurs, they are, I mean especially if you're first entrepreneurs, they're unsophisticated. They don't know what to do. They're kind of scared. By the way, engaging in building something again is an act of pure courage and usually one which is very hard to hide from others. The people around you will know that you're doing this thing. Ask any entrepreneur. The amount of people who tell you to not do this is actually stunning. People do not want people to just step out of a box that exists that they sort of explain to themselves around them and have a chance of reaching higher because that would sort of invalidate their own life story in some meaningful way.\n\n(01:21:38):\nSo there's actually a whole lot of nay saying that discourages people already, which is not super helpful. So now you have a situation where people are telling you to quit potentially, you don't have a lot of money presumably, you're asking yourself, are you even doing the right thing? Hopefully there's some elements of encouragement. Hopefully there's a passion. Hopefully you're trying to create a thing. Then comes to a situation that stuns you in some way, somewhere where suddenly the software starts talking about APIs where this is something you've never encountered in your life before or that just the option that you think it should have on the text configuration screen doesn't make sense given what we know about local taxes and so on. Here's the thing that happens. So the beautiful thing with Shopify is there's basically no tax configuration screen. It's just correct. The amazing thing about software is we can actually just overtake this piece of complexity.\n\n(01:22:53):\nWe know what the taxes are everywhere and we are just doing it for you. You don't have to think about taxes. In this case we have someone encountered something that stunned them, that stopped them in their tracks. On the wrong day, what that means, it's like they are going to close a browser and they say, \"You know what? Fuck it. I'm not cut out for this.\" Or, \"This piece of software I use sucks and it's too dumb for understanding the thing I have in my head,\" or something else. Everyone has a different rendering of the same thing, but just like progress stops. It is not just the businesses that shouldn't exist anyway that stop in this way. In fact, it's actually, and this is again what the data says, so many businesses get very close to this point many, many times. I can tell you Shopify did many times and I have more tools on entrepreneurial journey than most. I'm a computer programmer and I love those things. You tell me I can spend 14 hours programming for the next couple of years. I'm like, \"Holy shit, let's go.\"\n\n(01:24:01):\nMost people aren't like that. So I've had unfair advantages that allowed me to overcome very technical climbs on this learning curve, but I know that's like most people can't have these advantages and therefore will churn out of a test. And so in other words, lowering complexity, making good UX, creating software that just autopilots taxes or payments or any of these kinds of things, fraud, actually causes more entrepreneurship. That is the best thing, the best answer to the most important question of my life that I've encountered because up to this point it was an intuition that doing the Shopify thing would be valuable in absolute sense, in a hundred-year sense. Afterwards I knew, right? And so that also just means now seeing things that are overly complex or shouldn't even be there, it's just physically painful because I know, it's like all these business that are trying to get somewhere and could exist and could now employ people and delight customers just died along the way because of something we did wrong or poorly and so on. And so this is a great source of energy for me to keep going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:26):\nI feel that, I feel that pain of the idea of anytime a button's broken or it's not as... the button's wrong color and more people would be converting means that you're not creating as many businesses, many entrepreneurs. The feeling you described of being scared to launch something, I exactly felt that when I started the newsletter. And my solution to that as I launched it is, \"I'm just launching this as an experiment. We'll see where it goes, just don't worry about it. I might blog once in a while.\" And that really helped just lowering the stakes and I could see how just things like that and advice that can help someone get over that hump.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:26:01):\nYes, and I think this is an under explored thing in the word of UX. Random example, I was absolutely delighted by, maybe TikTok has the same thing, I don't know, but I was posting a video to Instagram and it allowed me to run a try run of the reel. It just seems like a new feature and just saying it shows it to a couple hundred people out of network and if they like it then it's going to post to my profile. I'm like, \"I don't need that.\" But I thought that was one of the more... I honestly just closed Instagram and was like, \"Holy shit, this is probably one of the most profound insightful pieces of software I've encountered. And as a connoisseur of good ideas, I've never had this as a valuable thing.\" It feels like a step function upgrade to the traditional A-B test as a concept because it's so understandable and I'm like, \"What else in the world should have try runs that run out of network?\" Basically everything, isn't it?\n\n(01:27:03):\nThis is an amazing thing. Like I said, the rarest thing in the world, it's not even creativity or genius, it's courage. So let's lower the net amount of courage needed. Honestly, that's one of those things you can probably run an entire career or reinvent an industry on. These things unfurl into incredible amounts of value if you really pursue them and come at them from first principles rather than how can I do the things I want to do anyway slightly better because of insight. That's good and people should always do it, but not usually where most of the value ends up becoming, like manifests when a new idea comes around. So I talk radically about an Instagram feature. That's a weird thing to do, but I was actually just really to delighted because again, it just came up a few days ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:54):\nI love this thread of courage. The example you gave reminds me also of I feel like going on a dating app at a different city for the first time is another example of this where it's a dry run, nobody knows you.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:06):\nBut even then, shouldn't there be like, \"Hey, post my profile to a different city for telling me if it's any good.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):\nSO people like it.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:14):\nI mean I've never dated basically so I mean at least not in the last 25 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):\nYeah, of the podcast.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:20):\nSo I'm pre swipe left and right dating, so my conception is very low of this. Maybe I should look more at dating apps. I'm pretty sure there's some amazing UX in most things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):\nI imagine. I feel like dating is going offline more and more. I'm feeling like that's what people are trying to do. They're tired of the swipe, but anyway, going to go in that direction. Maybe a couple more questions while I have you here. One is this idea of the talent stack. You've mentioned this concept before and this is the term that I've seen you describe it as of this idea of the power of focusing on your unique talents and curiosity and that leading you to the biggest opportunities, especially early in your career. Can you just talk about what your insight there.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:29:04):\nYeah, again, I only lived one life, so I can't Monte Carlo all the decisions I make and just figure out which ones ended up being load baring, right? I'm at this point pretty amused by the following thing which keeps happening. But I am getting curious about some absolutely random thing and it really is fairly far-flung stuff and like magic it becomes the way that ends up allowing me to make a very important choice a year later. It's ends up being a better analogy that I've learned or a different way to see something or another idea that I found being represented in this area of expertise that is actually just again, another repackaging of another foundational idea, which allows me to go and look for more examples.\n\n(01:29:57):\nAnd it's just funny this way. So even early in career just I followed my curiosity. I love programming and I love computers and I loved the internet when it came along and I just like, \"Cool, I'm going to find a task that I find valuable,\" which I was always engaged in retail and I have a lot to say about how retail should be brought by the internet to people. But this is a beautiful intersection of all the things that I find interesting. And then on top of it, I found Ruby, which I loved as a technology and then just now I was highly motivated to tinker, explore a space that was clearly emerging but just felt very obviously of value in the future.\n\n(01:30:44):\nBut I didn't do it because I was following money. I did it because I like learning by doing stuff and I like tinkering the things and so this was a way of financing my tinkering by selling snowboards and then it led to other things. And I've kind of been doing that thing all along. It's great fun, great fun for me. I don't know how much of a advice that is, but maybe a proof point that can work really well. I sometimes worry though that things like this end up being a little bit like all you need to do is buy a lottery ticket, set for lottery ticket winner, right? So it's, who knows?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):\nIt does resonate. It reminds me of something Brian Armstrong once shared, which is the reason that he-\n\nTobi Lütke (01:31:37):\nHe's also, by the way, you have to add him to the set of first principle thinkers if you're starting to cultivate one. And I think there's plenty of startup success, successful founders, CEOs, especially for public companies are surprisingly alike in this projecting slightly different, maybe coming from different backgrounds, but Brian is extraordinarily strong at this [inaudible 01:32:06] by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):\nOkay, here's to the next nominated for the podcast, Brian. We'll get on it. But interestingly, he had basically exact same advice for what allowed him to create Coinbase is his background was economics, coding and cryptography or something along those lines. And it's the Venn diagram, is like, \"This is the thing I'm uniquely strong at and have an opportunity to win it.\"\n\nTobi Lütke (01:32:29):\nYeah. So this is what we very actively tell our customers, right? There's a 2005 essay by Kevin Kelly saying, \"In the future on the internet you just need a thousand true fans.\" It's what the internet and I think what Shopify celebrates, that instead of trying to create toothpaste, which is of course a huge term but hard to differentiate. It's much better to figure out a triplicate intersection of three different things and nail it. We took a winter vacation with my boys and my family in the Caribbean and I like playing poker with them. I like playing poker and it's great limited information game. I think this were valuable for kids and so I found this, I might have mentioned this in some place, but I found this pirate gold I think it's called.\n\n(01:33:32):\nIt's just amazing poker set, poker chips that look like they come right out of the treasure chest or in Pirates of the Caribbean. Think about just the intersection, so this is online Texas Hold'em, quality poker set instead of... because you can play with just anything, right? People were in the market for spending money on something like this and pirate themed. You're like, \" But I'm such a big fan, I'm telling you about it and people might actually purchase it because I'm enthusiastic about it.\" And because enthusiasm is actually the best marketing and they have at least a thousand true fans, and it's just better to make amazing things for some people than make something that everyone wants maybe or would tolerate. And I think that's really, really good. So I think that works for your career too because by the way, we are all entrepreneurs so we're ready to think about any career.\n\n(01:34:36):\nIf you actually ask me for career advice is we are products, we are engaged in entrepreneurship, we are basically software as a service if you want, or talent as a service. We are selling a subscription in the form of our employment we call it, but it's actually just rebranded the subscription frankly because it comes some extra protection, which is very good, but it's still the same thing, it's a double opt-in company. Like you would say, I can do these things and I will be of significantly more value to the company than you will have to spend on me. There's like a positive ROI ideally for a company and a company either says, \"I agree or I don't agree with you.\" And that's actually what employment is. So I think people should think about themselves as a product. Your career is not based on mentors you find or getting a promotion or not.\n\n(01:35:34):\nIt's about what are you too good to ignore in? How good can you be? Can you be absolutely work? Can you be excellent? I mean you don't have to be work class and stuff, but you have to... Ideally you find a thing where you are just in this sort of tiny space of five intersections or so versus we just know more than everyone else and then everyone calls you. Like I said, we use Ruby. Ruby was not that fast. Shopify would rather have it very fast. We found people who got PhDs in dynamic language, garbage collection dynamic language, just in time compilation to make Ruby fast. And they're having delightful time at Shopify and Shopify is now very fast and it's very good. And everyone gets to profit from us needing this because we merged it back into Ruby Core and now everyone can have a JIT compiler. So it's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):\nI feel like every story is a fractal into other hours of other podcast conversation we can have. I know you have to go run this nine, 10, 10,000 person company and do real work. So I'm going to end it there. We got through almost everything I was hoping to get through, but there's infinitely more questions I still have. Just to maybe end it, is there anything you want to leave listeners with? Any last nugget that maybe you didn't mention?\n\nTobi Lütke (01:37:03):\nIf I get to talk to again people who look at product and product management, here's my thing that I think maybe only implicitly came through in all this. Every product in the world, the quality at the end of the day is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit about the product. And it is not possible to make great products if the people work on it do not give a shit about the product. And I actually think this is a very important role for product leaders to make sure that the team gives a shit. And I think this is something that can be done with building empathy for people using it, but also it can be done infectiously by the product leader. The product leader has to give a shit. Do not engage in product work on product that you don't care about because you cannot produce the thing that the person will give you a task is looking for.\n\n(01:38:04):\nAnd I think again, so much goes into this unquantifiable conversation which we already had, but boy is that important because it just isn't about the brief document, it isn't about the aligning stakeholders. Sometimes in some places some of those things are aspects of it and I think they correlate sometimes with people. But I think the higher order bit is if you are in product, you have basically free roads. You have to have the team sits, look around corners that they don't see. You just have to understand this thing that's being done better than everyone else because that's a role. Now, you don't have to do this by yourself. Everyone on the team is of a resource to you and you can query them and therefore determine what is around the corners and so on. But in engineering and UX and so on, but that's very important. Second is you've got to be exothermically infectious with actually caring about this thing because just that one thing alone will make a 10 times better product. It's crazy how much of a change this makes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):\nI feel like honestly what you're describing here is like founder mode, what the outputs are. Giving a shit, being exothermic excited and looking around corners. I feel like this is its own conversation here.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:39:37):\nYeah, I agree. I don't think founder mode, so I mean I think, yeah, founder mode is a super valuable term, but I actually do think that I answered the question about what I think about founder mode in the discussion about pumping heat into systems. That's what I do. It's just that founder mode in a founder run company, I think this has an easier time existing because people dislike the people who are pumping heat into a thing. People fight them, people probably take them out, and if the boss is like this, boss can protect the other people like this. And therefore I think founder run companies can be innovative longer because there's a substrate by which this can stay a thing for a long time. So anyway, that's my tear down on the founder mode discussion, which I think is a really fascinating recent discussion. I find it's very valuable. I'm sure it's misunderstood in all sorts of ways, but I think it's more actionable than people think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:40):\nTobi, I appreciate you continuing to drop nuggets, even though I know you have to go, by the way, your video looks incredible right now. This is amazing editing, we're doing like a rainbow streaming across your body.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:40:53):\nYeah, we really hit the rainbows here like, \"Let's go and invent.\" I hope you've got to gold that you were hoping and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):\nSo much gold.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:00):\n... I was sufficient leprechaun here to deliver.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:05):\nWhat a metaphor. Okay, Tobi, thank you so much for doing this. This was incredible. I feel like this is going to help so many people build great companies and thank you from first principles.\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:13):\nOkay, I got to run. Bye-bye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):\nOkay, bye.\n\n(01:41:18):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "zh": "Tobi Lütke (00:00:00):\n你的播客是一个由建设者（Builder）为其他建设者制作的播客。我认为人们能问建设者最有趣的问题是：你的能量来源是什么？我的能量来源是对现状（Status Quo）的不满。有很多书都在讨论这个话题……技术导致反乌托邦（Dystopia）。说实话，任何真正思考过这个问题的人，都不会想出生在今天之前的 20 年。我认为今天就是未来的反乌托邦。我们理应努力构建那些能够引领……走向进步的产品。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\n我读过几句描述你思考方式的名言，意思大抵如此：“如果大多数人都用某种方式做事，我默认（By default）就不想那样做。”\n\nTobi Lütke (00:00:34):\n世界上存在着一种审美（Aesthetic），即商务人士总是西装革履，说话比我老练得多，通常还没有口音。他们通常拿着一根教鞭，戏剧化地指向身后的图表。这种审美与卓越表现（Outperformance）之间有多少重叠？悲观主义听起来极其深奥，而乐观主义听起来总是很蠢，或者至少很天真。但在商业世界中，最强大的无法量化的东西是乐趣和愉悦感。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\n我不记得还有哪家公司的创始人在运营时，会对产品的走向拥有这种“百年愿景”，并基于此进行逆向推导（Working backwards）。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:11):\n我经常谈论展望未来，然后反向思考，对吧？就像“关于这件事，我们会希望 20 年前就已经做了什么？”我们有非常长期的计划。站在 100 年的维度上，你无法谈论某个具体的软件项目，但你可以谈论使命本身，谈论那些在这一特定时间框架内能存活 80 年的事物。创业精神（Entrepreneurship）是极其珍贵的。Shopify 存在的意义，基本上就是为了让创业变得更普遍。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\n你有什么想留给听众的吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:01:37):\n我真的、真的、真的认为，这个星球上没有一个人接近发挥出了他们的最大潜能（Maximum potential）。不断提醒人们他们自身的潜力，实际上是一件非常美妙的事情。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:54):\n今天的嘉宾是 Tobi Lütke。Tobi

(00:04:26):\n我听过很多你的其他访谈，也和一群为你工作的人聊过。我想尝试做一些不同的事情。在我听你的建议、采访以及与你的员工交流时，基本上有两个主题反复出现。一个是“从第一性原理（First principles）出发思考”，另一个是“最大化人类潜能”。我现在先埋下这些种子。我不会直接问这些，而是会从侧面通过我准备的许多问题来切入。我听 Shopify 的人描述过一个叫作“托比飓风”（Tobi tornado）的现象。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:01):\n噢，哇。好吧，这是一个开始。我喜欢这个切入点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\n什么是“托比飓风”？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:05:08):\n我会说，“托比飓风”是大量的变革管理（Change management）、对话、冲突或真诚交谈（Real talk）被压缩在一个非常短的时间内。我看到某些东西……它不太好，于是我发起对话。我会很快学习到一些东西，比如“嘿，我需要更新我的先验认知（Priors）”，或者“酷，让我们换个方式”。在那一刻，一个项目可能会被叫停，我们回到房间重新集合，然后开始一个新版本的产品。而当前团队中负责该特定项目的所有人，不再是在做旧项目，而是成为了构建方式截然不同的下一个版本的创始人。这对人们来说可能有点像“挥鞭伤”（Whiplashy，形容由于突然剧烈变动带来的冲击感）。我的意思是，我当然希望这是真的，这确实是人们告诉我的。这也是他们欣赏这家公司的地方。就像是，“什么才是最好的”最终变得至关重要。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:08):\n基本上就是你走进聊天室说：“嘿，这个……”、“我们要结束这个项目”、“让我们试试别的”，因为你发现或意识到这是一个糟糕的主意。有些人会抱怨这种做法，比如“噢，Tobi 砍掉了我们一直努力工作的项目”。我的视角是，你意识到我们只是在这些行不通的事情上虚度光阴，我们不该继续。在这方面有什么想说的吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:06:32):\n不。这就是全部。再说一次，一旦我察觉到某些东西可能不是正确的方向，要么我错了（这时我理解为什么我错了就变得极其重要），要么我对了（这时让人们继续做那些无法成功的项目是非常不公平的）。还有第三种选择，就是我可以忽略它，但那是对我作为 CEO 和创始人责任的失职（Abjection/Abnegation），我绝对不愿这样做，所以那不是我认为有效的路径。我知道那是很多人的选择。所以，是的，压缩时间很重要。我们的职业生涯时间相当有限，对吧？我们的职业生涯并不那么长。如果你幸运的话，你在行业里有 40 年时间。大多数人在学校花的时间更多，如果足够幸运能退休的话，可能走得更晚。所以时间甚至没那么多。\n\n(00:07:33):\n我认为你会想在职业生涯结束时，做尽可能多让自己感到自豪的事情。当你回首往事时，你会想说：“嘿，天哪，我们发布了那个东西，那绝对是我所关心的使命在一个充满志同道合者的公司里做出的不可思议的贡献。”而且也为自己的工作感到自豪。甚至可能会想到和我一起工作，并为我们一起在项目上度过的时光感到非常、非常高兴。是的，如果每个人都在优化一个本不该存在的东西，那么这一切都不会发生。因此，我认为这样做（指果断干预）是更好的选择。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:16):\n顺便说一下，我很喜欢这种描述……在时间上压缩它以便做出决定，而不是专注于让它看起来最仁慈、最友好、最贴心。当你给人们反馈某些事情不如你预期的那样，或者不如你认为的那样好时，通常是非常直接且刺耳的。对我来说，这给人的感觉是你正试图最大化他们的潜能，你正试图推动他们做得更好。关于这种反馈方式，你有什么看法？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:08:49):\n我真的、真的、真的认为，这个星球上没有一个人接近发挥出了他们的最大潜能。我只是觉得每个人都比他们想象的要优秀得多、多、多、多。我们之所以没有表现出这种水平，是因为一系列的观念，也许是某些磨练技能和手艺（Crafts）的方法尚未被发现，因此我们无法利用它们。环境往往会将焦点缩小在相当缺乏雄心壮志（Unambitious）的事情上，这时你就会陷入与世界上几乎所有人竞争的境地，因为每个人都缺乏雄心。\n\n(00:09:33):\n我发现，不断提醒人们他们自身的潜力实际上是一件非常美妙的事情。而且，在判断人的潜力方面，我一向比他们自己更准。现在，在某种程度上，这常常注定让我对自己感到失望，对吧？顺便说一下，我也在说我自己。我认为我拥有的潜力远超我目前表现出来的，我讨厌这一点，所以我正在努力培养明天所需的技能，并不断挑战自己。我对自己的要求比对任何人都严。我会以某种折扣率（Discount rate），同样地对待我身边的人，尤其是那些显然才华横溢的人。\n\n(00:10:23):\n在职业生涯中与人们共度更长的时间，并对他们保持高标准，意味着他们经常能完成一些他们自己都无法想象的事情。对我来说，这是最美妙的一幕。坦率地说，这是贯穿我整个职业生涯的一条主线，因为……我的产品就是这样。我希望我的产品能让人们比他们想象中更成功。事实上，让他们对通过在线商店和业务所构建的东西，变得比最初设定的目标更加充满雄心。\n\n(00:10:56):\n因为我也有过类似的经历，对吧？我在某个时间点开了一家单板滑雪商店，当时并没打算建立 Shopify。如果你致力于追随自己的好奇心去走下一步，并在选择这些步骤时优化学习量的最大化，它就会带你从一个地方走向另一个地方，然后你会意识到，这个世界充满了关于人类潜能和进步的谎言。也许人们并非心怀恶意，但他们确实对此感到困惑。学校教导你，你必须在这 12 个月内学会这部分特定的数学知识，而你理解了多少并不重要。这就像是结果是变量，而他们根据变量结果在固定时间内给你评分，这与我所见过、学过或见证过的关于如何实际学习事物的任何事情都毫无关系。你顺着这条线索走下去，就会发现个人成长是没有速度限制（Speed limit）的。在某种程度上，Shopify 一直是这种信念的一个绝佳实验实验室。我亲眼见证了这一切成真。而且，当然，从一个你尊重的人那里听到：“嘿，我认为你有能力把这件事做得更好，因为我想你可能在项目初期就看到了路径 A 和路径 B。你可能出于方便选择了路径 B，尽管你知道那不是正确的选择。我其实对你有更高的期望，我期待……”“我认为下次职业生涯中发生这种情况时，你应该选择路径 A，因为……”“基于你的信念。”因此，这话听起来很刺耳，对吧，因为它是正确的。但它也极其宝贵，对吧？我喜欢的是这样一种环境：人们根据彼此的实际潜力，而不是根据目前的水平再加上一点点额外的进步，来要求彼此负责。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):\n这里有很多我想追随的线索。学校的例子非常贴切。对我来说，现在我们正在为儿子寻找幼儿园，我……他们在描述他们的教育理念，而我心想，我不知道为什么我应该相信这是正确的方法。这让我只想花所有时间去研究什么样的教育方法有效。我知道这只是幼儿园，也许还没那么关键。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:13:38):\n你已经有定论了吗？我也有三个孩子，这是每个父母都会面临的选择，对吧？你的许多听众可能是机器学习（Machine Learning）产品的产品经理，也许这会引起共鸣。机器学习有一件有趣的事情……你在大量数据上进行训练，希望从中得到一个能正确预测你想要预测的事物的东西。这其中最大的问题是过拟合（Overfitting，指模型过度拟合训练数据而失去泛化能力），对吧？什么是好的标准，损失函数（Loss function，用于衡量模型预测值与真实值差异的函数）是什么？这是一种启发法（Heuristic），因为它不是该事物将来要执行的实际任务，它是你希望该事物将来执行的任务的代理指标（Proxies）。预测欺诈、预测下一个词等等。所以过拟合基本上就是模型学会了如何在基准测试（Benchmark）或适应度函数上作弊。\n\n(00:14:39):\n在商业上有一个类似的类比，叫做古德哈特定律（Goodhart's law）。它实际上和商业中的过拟合是一回事。古德哈特定律说：“任何一项指标一旦成为目标，它就不再是一个好指标了。”完全是一回事。普遍真理是几乎任何竞争领域都会通过不同的术语为自己发明的。顺便说一句，我认为这也是为什么专注于个人成长并博学多才如此有趣的原因，因为你最终会发现事物背后这些隐藏的和谐，那些显然持久且正确的见解。所以过拟合和古德哈特定律是一回事。学校优化的是什么？理应是分数，对吧？事实上，学校里的过拟合字面上就是孩子们为了拿高分而作弊，对吧？这是另一个类比。然而，对于孩子来说，正确的损失函数（Loss function）是什么？你做出决定了吗？\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:53):\n没有，我还没决定，我们才刚刚开始。你刚才告诉我——\n\nTobi Lütke (00:15:55):\n这就是那种[听不清 00:15:57]的事情。你必须在哲学上钻研得相当深才能弄明白。然后之后你就可以建立，你可以找到你喜欢的学校。对我们来说，目标就是保持好奇心。这与擅长拿高分是完全不同的目标。但我认为每个人生来都极具好奇心，而学校有一种把这种好奇心从孩子身上磨灭掉的习惯。字面上看，孩子就像一个基础模型（Foundation model），你在学校对它进行微调（Fine-tune），它就会丢失好奇心的神经元，因为仅仅因为感兴趣而去漫游并探索其他话题实际上是被阻止的。我不知道。这可能不是播客的主题，但我经常思考这个问题。有趣的是，这些事情总是不断循环出现。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):\n当 Archie 来参加播客时，他是 Shopify 的增长负责人……我不确定这是否是他的官方头衔。基本上他推动了很多增长。他谈到，除了增长团队之外的核心产品团队，在没有 KPI（Key Performance Indicators，关键绩效指标）和特定目标的情况下运作。决策主要由你、Glen 和其他一些领导者的品味和直觉驱动。很多人听到后会想：“我……”“首先，我不相信。其次，在没有数据告诉我们到底什么是正确和好的情况下，一个人如何以这种方式运作？”所以我的问题是，一个人如何成功地以这种方式运作？一家公司要以这种方式运作需要什么，因为很多人尝试这样做都会失败？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:17:25):\n这与我刚才提到的[听不清 00:17:28]非常接近。古德哈特定律（Goodhart's law）是真实存在的。一个指标一旦成为目标，它就不再是一个有用的指标了，对吧？我认为这或多或少是准确的措辞。为什么？因为没有任何单一指标本身能成为复杂业务的完整启发（Heuristic），因为业务是复杂的。公司里有成千上万种不同的张力，你无法通过优化一个固定的东西来让它们保持和谐。确实，我们没有 KPI，至少没有硅谷意义上的 OKR（Objectives and Key Results，目标与关键结果），但我们是极度参考数据的（Data-informed）。我们在系统上投入了大量的金钱和时间，这些系统基本上能让我们掌握一切信息。我把这个演示发给其他创始人看，他们完全被我们深入挖掘每个组成部分的能力惊呆了，无论是季度末、月末还是周末，甚至是 15 分钟前刚刚形成的同期群（Cohort，具有共同特征的用户群体）的每一个原子级组成部分。\n\n(00:18:39):\n在很多不同的地方，这是其中之一，但在其产品中，它不仅仅是对可量化的东西进行过拟合（Overfitting）。每个人都在为所有事情竞争，但它是高度可量化的，因为……这很有趣，就像游戏一样。你调整一个数字，增加 0.1 就是比减少 0.1 好。这是一种即时满足。但我认为，你可以通过产品做的最有价值的事情，与那些恰好可以完全量化的事情之间的重合度，大概只有 20%，这留下了 80% 的价值空间，是那些只看可量化事物的人无法触及的。Shopify 对不可量化的事物感到坦然，比如品味、质量、激情、爱、恨。这是人们拥有的强烈情感。\n\n(00:19:49):\n如果你允许的话，一个手艺人在工作做得出色时所感受到的那种深层满足感，实际上是比“单元测试（Unit test）是否通过”更好的代理指标。单元测试可能没通过。但单元测试 15 分钟后就会通过，因为我们已经修复了它们，或者调整了一两处让它们支持我们。我们有系统可以准确地告诉我们是否出了问题。Shopify 有一个极其复杂的发布系统，在每个实验中都会永久保留对照组（Holdouts），并将所有事物与所有事物关联起来，等等等等。但如果你把它想象成飞行员的驾驶舱。决策仍然是由飞行员做出的，我们认为这会带来更好的结果。我们的产品也是如此。对于电子商务，有很多 A/B 测试工具和所有这些东西，弄清楚你的转化率（Conversion rates）当然非常重要。但是，你是否代表了你的品牌，这是一个不可量化的问题。你是否为你所建造的东西感到自豪？你觉得它是你自己的吗，对吧？\n\n(00:21:03):\n因此，我认为企业需要对不可量化的事物有更多的接受度。商业世界中最强大的不可量化事物是乐趣和愉悦。如果人们在做某事时感到有趣，那是许多其他事情的上游……抱歉，是许多其他事情的下游。我认为，如果所有指标都在下降，但每个人都说：“天哪，我现在的乐趣多得多了”，我认为紧接着会发生的事情，经过一段时间延迟后，所有指标都会开始上升。如果那没有发生，那我们就调整航向。\n\n(00:21:51):\n我们特别没有 OKR（Objectives and Key Results）和这些东西的原因是……如果你想把不可量化的事物视为稳定且存在的事物……人们确实会听从它们，并真正学会接受有人说：“嘿，这其实非常棒，他们正在发布这个”，那么你需要对业务进行某些调整，不要让每个人都过多地联想到他们可能来自的那些公司，在那些公司里，获得晋升的唯一途径就是推动指标上升。我想这是一个有点[听不清 00:22:24]的谈话。幸运饼干上的格言写着：“Shopify 不做 OKR 或指标”等等。但实际上只是因为指标会将我们带向[听不清 00:22:37]函数，而我们经常转向更……有时是感性的，但通常是较少可量化的事物。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):\n我设想，如果有人听到你描述对喜悦、乐趣、爱和愉悦的关注，也许……很容易对此不屑一顾。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:22:58):\n这听起来完全是白痴行为，对吧？同样，世界上存在着一种审美，即商务人士西装革履，说话比我通常说的更老练，没有口音，头发浓密。他们谈论指标，站在 PowerPoint 演示文稿前，通常拿着一根棍子，对着身后的饼图戏剧性地指点。而且非常有魅力，非常……那是我们的审美。那种审美与我们的表现有多少重合？我不知道，但确实有一些这样的人成功了。我认为这个世界有点倾向于误导我们，基于我们对“最佳状态”样貌的描述，在很多方面都是错误的。乐观主义听起来总是很愚蠢，或者至少很幼稚。悲观主义听起来极其深奥。指标驱动听起来极其深奥。谈论乐趣听起来很幼稚。\n\n(00:24:14):\n首先，我通常总是忽视别人的想法。不知何故，这对我来说是与生俱来的，我非常幸运。但我现在实际上学到，世界上几乎所有的阿尔法（Alpha，指超越市场平均水平的超额收益）现在都在……恰恰是那些不明显但却是真实的事情中。以及那些被人们斥为幼稚的事情中。地球上最成功的商人是埃隆（Elon），他完全不符合你所能想象到的任何关于最老练商人应该是什么样子的想法。我认为我们生活在一个反事实（Counterfactuals，指与普遍预期相反的事实）正在获胜的世界，因为我们的……因为审美正在误导我们。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\n这是一个非常棒的过渡，引出了我想花点时间讨论的另一个主题，即从“第一性原理”（First Principles，指回归事物最基本的条件，将其拆解成各部分再重新构建）出发进行思考。埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）是这方面的经典例子。老实说，我认为你也是当今这方面最典型的例子。我们将继续讨论你与那些作为行业范例的其他公司截然不同的运作方式。但我先想读一段 Glen Coates 分享给我的话，这是他眼中的你，为理解你的第一性原理思维提供了一个有趣的视角。他是这么评价你的：“Tobi 在内心深处是一个真正的未来主义者，他痴迷于未来事物应有的样子。‘数据驱动’（Data-driven）本质上是锚定在用户和技术当今的行为方式上。他从未明确对我这么说过，但了解他之后，我认为任何主要基于现状或过去而设计的方案，在他看来都逊色于那种‘向着未来趋势滑行’（Skating to the puck of the way things could or should be，借用冰球术语，意为预测并抢占先机）的方案。”这能引起你的共鸣吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:25:55):\n是的，我觉得这很准确。这其实非常有趣。你的播客是一个由构建者（Builder）为其他构建者制作的播客——\n\nTobi Lütke (00:26:01):\n我认为人们可以问构建者最有趣的问题是：“你的能量来源是什么？你从哪里获得能量？”我认为从根本上说，世界是以“室温”（Room temperature，意指平庸、无活力的状态）存在的。几乎所有公司都在那个温度下运行，平稳地嗡嗡作响，却无所作为。但某些特定的个体可以为业务注入“热量”。创始人就非常擅长这一点。所有人们听说过的初创公司都有人在注入热量，因为如果没有人向业务注入热量，在室温状态下，你不可能超越任何其他人。如果没有人向这家企业注入热量，你不可能比其他人都更火热。所以从根本上说，公司内部存在一种能量注入，这种能量来自创始人。而且最优秀的领导者——就像你请到播客上的所有来自 Shopify 的人——他们就像是一群完美的角色阵容，每个人都是“放热的”（Exothermic，指能自发释放能量并带动他人）。他们就像能量的源泉，带来了我们现在所享有的所有惊人成果。\n\n(00:27:21):\n所以问题是，能量从何而来？这是我们另一个很快就会进入情感层面的讨论。实际上，这有一个非常……我前段时间看了迈克尔·乔丹（Michael Jordan）的纪录片《最后一舞》（The Last Dance），当然是很久以前看的了，但其中有一个场景，我确信这是一个超级出名的故事：他编造了一个别人对他说的评价，只是为了让自己想在随后的比赛中摧毁对手。当然，他随后确实这么做了，因为很难想象有谁比他更“放热”。所以我们知道他的能量来源是什么。是竞争意识，也可能是某种洞察力，或者是愤怒之类的情绪。\n\n(00:28:06):\n我不是……我的能量来源是对现状的不满。我的基本信念是，目前关于技术的所有讨论中，有那么多书都在讲技术如何导致“反乌托邦”（Dystopia）。你知道什么是反乌托邦吗？相对于 20 年后或任何未来的样子，今天就是反乌托邦。这种逻辑可以套用到人类历史的任何阶段。我不是在做关于未来的陈述，我是在做一个关于地球生活体验的、近乎“同义反复”（Tautological，指在逻辑上必然为真的陈述）的结论。任何真正思考过这个问题的人，都不会希望自己出生在 20 年前而不是今天。因此，我认为今天就是未来的反乌托邦，我认为我们有责任尝试构建那种能或多或少推动进步的产品。但是，如果有人来对我说：“嘿，我们去做这件事吧。我们观察了一下，别人是这么解决这个问题的，我们也做一个‘好用版’吧。”我会觉得：“这不是我们要干的工作。”因为你遇到的每一件事、每一个解决方案、每一个产品、每一个存在的事物都是“路径依赖”（Path-dependent，指事物的发展受制于其历史路径）的，而且是高度、高度、高度路径依赖的。它们通常是基于必须做出的妥协，基于做出决定时是正确但现在已不再正确的条件。\n\n(00:29:38):\n整个领域……叫什么来着？我忘了那个领域的名字。乔姆斯基（Chomsky）的领域，语言学研究领域。这很有趣。我们现在有了“自回归模型”（Autoregressive models，AI 领域的一种模型架构），我们实际上不需要建立一个完整的……我们不需要研究语法结构就能让机器参与对话。事实证明，我们只需要在互联网数据上进行训练。这在以前是不可能的，因为当时没有合适的架构，但现在有了。所以我觉得你必须要做的是，当你构思一个新产品或讨论一个新产品时，你必须从第一性原理去推导它。你必须说：“考虑到我们目前拥有的所有基础‘积木’（Building block），我们要如何解决这个问题？”\n\n(00:30:25):\n要做到这一点，你实际上必须理解目前存在的所有基础组件的力量和“可组合性”（Composability），这是一个很高的要求，没有人能做到完美。但通过这种方式，你可以说：“好吧，太棒了，这就是我们实施这件事的方式，这就是它在今天被实现的方式。”现在我们可以讨论是否要走捷径。“也许我们应该按照别人的做法开始。也许我们推导出的正确做法恰好就是别人正在做的事。”\n\n(00:30:56):\n有时候，现状中蕴含的智慧比你预想的要多得多，我觉得这非常令人惊喜。当你意识到这一点并付诸行动时，也是很棒的。但绝对不能接受的是跳过推演过程，直接做和别人一样的事，因为那又是一种“产品领导力的失职”（Abdication of product leadership）。所以，如果我收到一份提案，说要做一个别人都在做的东西的“加强版”，我会变得极其多疑，因为我发现在我们的领域，这极少会是最佳解决方案。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:33):\n我见过几句描述你这种思维方式的话。“如果大多数人都以某种方式做事，我默认就不想那样做。如果你想做世界级（World-class）的事情，你就不能像其他人那样做。”\n\nTobi Lütke (00:31:46):\n是的。我甚至不认为这只是我持有的一个观点。我认为这实际上……我们基本上进入了“公理”（Axiom）领域。如果你想做出比现有事物更好的东西，你必须做得与众不同。这并不是说你做完之后它一定会变得更好，它也可能变得更糟。但如果你做同样的事情，就不可能做出更好的东西。这在“公理”上是不可能的，它违反了“阿基米德逻辑”（Archimedean logic，此处指基础的逻辑严密性）。然而，你会惊讶于有多少商业计划书在这种方式上违反了阿基米德逻辑，比如：“让我们把已经在做的这件事做一个好用的版本，然后我们将占领 1% 的市场。”类似这种。就像是，“相信我”。我觉得这种想法甚至有点幼稚。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):\n你能不能分享一个你用这种方式处理问题的例子？我想这种情况一直在发生。你也提到你天生如此，所以我觉得让别人坐下来学习像 Tobi 那样思考可能很难，但我很想帮助人们开始尝试这样处理问题，所以或许一个例子会有帮助。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:32:54):\n我觉得这完全是可以习得的。我鼓励人们养成“分步骤思考”（Think step by step）的习惯，然后付诸实践。这很快就会成为一种习惯，因为它的表现确实更出色。\n\n(00:33:09):\n举个例子。最初的例子就是 Shopify 本身。这很有意思。当时有很多电子商务软件，它们之所以是那个样子，全是因为“路径依赖”。因为在 2004、2005 年，每个想要电商软件的人都是现有的零售商，因此他们拥有复杂的业务，需要搬到线上，包括他们所有那些相当“拜占庭式”（Byzantine，意指极其复杂、混乱）的业务逻辑。而我想要制作能在“未来的互联网”上运行良好的电商软件，我相信在线上创办新公司比在物理世界中更容易，因为物理世界受到很多法规的束缚，还有租赁的预付成本等等。所以，让我们针对这种情况进行优化，构建一个使用起来非常直观的产品，让那些在枯燥职业中感到沮丧的人，可以利用午休时间在建立自己的事业上取得进展，最终让他们能走上自己的道路。\n\n(00:34:25):\n事实证明，这种偏向初创者的做法，最终也成为了解决所有“企业级”（Enterprise）案例的更好准备。因为没有人必须……企业级软件往往针对“销售流程”进行“过拟合”（Overfit，机器学习术语，指模型过度拟合特定数据而失去通用性），它之所以能赢得“征求建议书”（RFP，Request for Proposal，即标书），是因为它拥有历史上所有的功能，或者至少有办法在标书的每一行要求旁边打勾。但它们并不好用，对吧？RFP 是采购领域“过拟合”的一个典型例子，因为它完全无法告诉你软件背后的质量。但老实说，这种情况随处可见。就像现在，我们正在为 Shopify 内部及跨平台的搜索产品搭建更高质量的“检索”（Retrieval）框架。我认为我们在搜索领域一直处于一个“局部最优解”（Local maxima，数学术语，指在一个小范围内是最好的，但不是全局最好的），我们认为，特别是随着新模型的进步，某些事情现在已经可以实现了，而以前是做不到的。这同样是因为一层又一层的路径依赖，没有人站出来说：“这是最好的方式吗？也许我们应该定期重建这个组件？”现在我们可以把搜索做得更好，从而带来更令人愉悦的体验。这是一个目前正在进行的有趣项目。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):\n我觉得这非常有趣，因为我寻找的是类似“Tobi 的第一性原理思考算法”。埃隆分享过他那些著名的思考方式：一种是从金属成本开始，帮你理解一枚火箭应该花多少钱。然后他有一个五步法：首先，决定我们是否需要这个东西？然后想办法优化它，接着是自动化。到目前为止我听到的，我很好奇你有没有系统地想过这个？如果没有，这感觉会是你未来一篇非常棒的博客文章，叫“Tobi 的第一性原理算法”。但我先分享一下我目前从你的描述中听到的几点。\n\n(00:36:24):\n一是分析现有解决方案所依赖的路径，就像是分析它在最初构建时所基于的那些假设。另一条是这个“过拟合”——它是在针对什么进行过拟合？它在过度解决哪些可能并不必要的问题？关于你处理问题的方式，还有其他类似的逻辑吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:36:43):\n这可能太偏技术宅（nerdy technical）了。你是对的，但我应该自我剖析一下。我的大脑运行在一种 Meta-language（元语言，用于描述其他语言的语言）之上，我想这并不是我能直接翻译成文字的东西。我更多地从编程结构的角度来思考这类事情，比如 Pure functions（纯函数，给定相同输入总是返回相同输出且无副作用的函数）和 State（状态，系统在特定时间点的数据快照）。我认为在任何时刻，能做出的最佳决策是——我认为完美的候选产品负责人（Product Lead）就像是一个高质量产品的 Thermostat（恒温器）。就像你在设定它，说：“我想打造一些非常、非常棒的东西，我要经历一系列比恒温器复杂得多的过程”，恒温器基本上只是检查温度，然后决定开启空调还是暖气。而你是在重新推导字面意义上每一个有价值的决定，每一个基础假设，每一个基础的 ABC 方向。你希望看到自上次推导下一步以来，你在此期间所做的观察。在目前已经更新的 State（状态）上，也就是更高 Fidelity（保真度）的信息上，重新运行整个函数，你还会得出完全相同的结果吗？\n\n(00:38:08):\n有时在基础假设的决策树（Tree of foundational assumptions）构建的早期，改变就已经发生了。我们都经历过的一个例子是 COVID（新冠疫情）初期，当时我们突然接到了 Shelter in place（居家令）。Shopify 拥有非常出色的办公空间，我们曾是一家非常注重面对面办公的公司，而且我们……我们的办公室平面图，因为我认为我们在理解如何打造伟大的协作空间方面确实有所贡献……我从我的联合创始人 Daniel 那里得到了很多来自创始人的能量，去为创意工作建立伟大的协作空间，创造很多“快乐的意外（Happy accidents）”，让人们互相偶遇等等。\n\n(00:38:46):\n总之，我们曾非常、非常、非常坚定地要做那件事。但在这种嵌套函数（Nesting functions）的结构中，你必须重新运行并检查基础假设。在 Stack（栈，程序运行时的内存结构）中有一个相当基础的 Boolean（布尔值，即真/假值）：人们被允许离开家吗？以前答案是“是”。当这个值翻转（Flip）的那一刻，不仅仅是说：“好吧，在那边让我们尽力而为。”实际上是整个决策树现在都移到了一个不同的地方。你落下的地方可能是一个非常遥远、不同的地方，因为你在每一步都会做出同样质量的决策，但你需要重新运行一些东西，带你到一个完全不同的着陆区。所以，这对我们来说也很容易说出：“太好了，我们要永远实行远程优先（Remote only）了？出发吧。”因为我们意识到，暂时的居家令会引发一系列事件，这将使远程办公成为公司最优的最佳权衡方案。所以我觉得这是……我能不能把它总结成精简的五个步骤？我不知道，但也许它能引起某些人的共鸣，他们可以帮我为这种思维方式找出“编程化的英语语言（Coded English language）”，因为即使对我来说，我刚才解释它的方式也太技术宅了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\n这个远程工作的例子是我绝对想聊到的，很高兴你提到了它。那么在这个决策中，关于你是如何到达“哦，这个 Boolean（布尔值）改变了，所以我们应该重新思考这个问题”的境地的，你还能分享更多吗？因为我知道你可能，你当时不是……我不知道。你是在洗澡时突然想到，“噢哇，因为这个，我们真的应该转型远程”吗？这实际上是怎么发生的？然后我还想问另一个部分——\n\nTobi Lütke (00:40:27):\n是的，基本上确实是这样。因为再说一次，我会重新运行所有的输入，看看会发生什么。这里还有一些其他的事情，也让“面对面办公”的决策开始出现裂痕。我们是从加拿大渥太华开始的，那是一个拥有一百万人口的城市，有一些科技传承和不错的大学。但对于一百万人口来说，它的人口密度不够，人才库的深度也无法支撑一家发展到一万人的公司。所以，任何运行我在这里提到的关于新初创公司地点战略的 Optimization function（优化函数）的人，如果他们做对了，都会得出结论：每个人都应该围坐在同一张桌子旁。只有当你做不到这一点时，你才会说：“好吧，让我们都在同一个房间里。”只有当这也不行时，你才会说：“好吧，让我们分布在同一层楼。”如果那也不行，就在同一栋楼里。如果那还不行，就在同一个城市。如果那也不行，至少留在时区相同的地方，或者确保之间有良好的枢纽连接。\n\n(00:41:39):\n这就是它的运作方式。就像路线上的某个假设在某个地方失效了。你最终会进入决策树（Decision tree）的另一个分支。但发生在我们身上的是，我们当时已经在四五个城市里了。在那个时间点，我们还坚持在同一个时区。但我的经历是，有时在渥太华办公室，我经历了一整天 10 个小时的会议（这相当正常），但我做的每一件事……我觉得有时我身边连一个其他的人都没有，因为每一个会议都是和另一个办公室的人开的。有些人是远程拨入的，等等。所以我们最终陷入了一种尴尬的 Hybrid-ness（混合模式），尽管这一路上我们做出的每一个决定都是正确的。\n\n(00:42:29):\n这实际上是最危险的事情。大多数时候，你仅仅通过做出好的选择，就最终陷入了决策树的一个糟糕部分，陷入了 Path-dependent environment（路径依赖环境）中的 Local maxima（局部最优解，指在局部范围内最好但在全局并非最优的状态）。人们认为做出好的选择就能让你免于犯错，或者一个想法存在负面影响就意味着该想法不合格。这两者都是错误的。所以你需要做的就是……那是决策的一个覆盖层。\n\n(00:42:59):\nCOVID 开始的那一刻，我们也遇到了购物者爆发式增长的情况，因为在 COVID 期间，我们实际上是人们的资产，是当地企业的电子商务平台。我们非常、非常认真地对待这件事，努力让更多的企业在 COVID 中生存下来，让小企业度过这场灾难，否则它们可能无法幸存。这很重要，因为每当时代变得脆弱时，小企业往往是最先被抹去的。所以我们需要增加人手。于是就产生了一个很奇怪的问题：在哪里招人？显然，如果你能在任何地方招人，那将是更好的输入。所以一旦那个决策翻转了，你可以看到现在说“我们要转型远程”实际上是非常容易的，因为没有回头路了。没有……即使有了这个决定，对于未来更好的权衡也是接受建立远程公司所带来的巨大额外难度。这要难得多。\n\n(00:44:03):\n这不是你应该推荐给任何人去做的事情，因为这就像是在科罗拉多州的阿斯彭尝试跑出马拉松世界纪录。那里没有足够的氧气来做那件事。但如果你最终成功了，那你就是个真正的 Chad（俚语，指充满自信、成功的强人）。那非常酷。所以我发现困难本身就很有趣。再说一次，我的青少年时期有足够的时间是在互联网上度过的，所以我知道完全通过远程方式也可以建立起令人惊叹的文化，比如，我不知道，维基百科（Wikipedia）、《魔兽世界》（World of Warcraft）的团队副本公会（Raiding Guilds），至少可以拥有出色的文化。所以我们觉得，“好吧，酷。让我们进入一个新的稳定状态。”那个稳定状态就是：不要把办公室搬到网上，要把互联网搬进公司，然后我们就说，“出发吧。”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:00):\n本集节目由 Loom 赞助。Loom 让你能够记录你的屏幕、摄像头和声音，轻松分享视频消息。录制一段 Loom

stack（人才栈）概念，你提到了好几次，我也思考了很多。但在那之前，我想转向另一个方向，我认为这是你能成功进行 First principles thinking（第一性原理思考）的一个有趣的基石，那就是你通过投入大量时间写代码，让自己进入 Metal（金属，指计算机硬件层），进入你所解决问题的核心。我实际上听过一个故事，说你们有一次巨大的 All-hands summit（全员大会）。你把所有人都空运过来，大家聚在一起。当时有一个为期三天的 Hackathon（黑客松）。描述是这样的：你戴着耳机坐在一张桌子旁写代码，就像任何一个 IC engineer（IC 工程师，独立贡献者/一线工程师）一样。没人会知道你是这家公司的 CEO，是这家公司的创始人。为什么写代码和亲自动手写代码对你来说仍然如此重要？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:46:46):\n这个故事传成这样真有意思。它是真的，但我不知道为什么这会让人惊讶。那是我的 Happy place（让我感到快乐的地方），能够清空我日历上闲暇的三天，和所有加入我们旅程的出色的人一起待到午夜，只是为了创造东西。就像是，我做我的工作，是为了让其他人的工作中也存在这样的机会。那是我真正想要的工作。那是我找不到的工作，因为没有人为我开一家这样的公司。至少在过去的大部分日子里是这样，我想现在其实也还是这样。\n\n(00:47:26):\n所以我就是热爱编码。它是最伟大的、我不知道、爱好和追求之一。我已经做了很长时间了。我接触它非常、非常早。它像手套一样契合我的大脑。我非常欣赏编码背后的 Craft（手艺/匠心）。我是德国受过培训的学徒……抱歉，我在德国当过程序员学徒，德国有一种双元制教育体系可以让你做这样的事情。所以我从刚满 16 岁开始就一直专业地待在公司里整天写代码。我真的没开玩笑。我想第一天上班正好是我 16 岁生日前夕，那时我开始了我的学徒生涯。\n\n(00:48:18):\n所以我爱它。我的屏幕左边现在就有一个光标，打开了一个 Jupyter notebook（Jupyter 笔记本，一种交互式计算环境），我正在处理一些我正在研究的预测模型。我尽可能地对我得到的信息进行 Sanity-check（完整性/合理性检查）。我尝试寻找……对我来说，在数据中寻找新的见解就像是一个游戏。我觉得，我不知道，这很酷。也许这就是你说的那个画面。有人拍了一张照片，真的很有趣，画面中我和一群工程师在一起用笔记本电脑写代码，然后 Harley，也就是总裁，在台上当 DJ（打碟）。这张照片大概是凌晨一点左右拍的。这张照片对我们两个来说其实非常珍贵，因为它以一种完美的方式总结了我们的关系，这些“快乐的意外”非常奇妙，而且这些漫长的旅程——我已经做 Shopify 20 年了，所以我很珍惜这些 Artifacts（遗存/记忆载体）。但是是的，所以……\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\n说明一下，这之所以不同寻常，也是为什么有人告诉我这个故事的原因，是因为大多数 CEO 不会这样做，不会只是坐在那里和团队一起写代码。我认为这个故事很重要的原因是，我认为你的“第一性原理”方法之所以奏效，是因为你确实身处工程细节之中，如果你仔细想想，这和埃隆（马斯克）很像，只是在基层做这些事，理解事情是如何运作的，而不是仅仅通过空谈（Pontifications）产生想法。所以我想，如果想要从第一性原理出发思考，真正 Close to the metal（贴近底层）、Bare metal（贴近硬件/核心）到底有多重要？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:50:11):\n嗯，是的。第一性原理思维（First principles thinking）的起点，我认为埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）将其归结为物理学，我觉得这有点过于偏向“原子”（atoms-coded，指物理世界）。我认为真正的起点应该是从最基础的构建模块开始。而我们的原子构建模块就是正在使用的计算机。计算机是我们的乐器。我们用它们来创作音乐，而人们以软件的形式来欣赏和接收这些音乐。所以你必须了解它们是如何运作的，至少要像我这样工作，就必须做到这一点。\n\n(00:50:48):\n那么，我的工作方式是最优的吗？当然不是。这就是我所说的关于行为和工作方式的美学。我可能不符合传统观点中大多数上市公司应该有的样子，甚至不符合他们应该如何分配时间的观点。但我认为我之所以成功，是因为我不去迎合任何东西，除了那些我学到的、行之有效的方法。我学到的有效方法就是：尽可能地深入细节。真的，真的，真的要去理解那些我们正在做决策的事情，并且愿意不陷入沉没成本谬误（sunk cost fallacy，指为了避免之前的投入白费而继续错误的投资）。尽可能让业务或公司部门对沉没成本谬误产生免疫，因为这能让你看到更好的解决方案等等。\n\n(00:51:45):\n如果我没记错的话，我们当时在“黑客日”（hack dates，指公司内部的编程竞赛或集中协作日）所做的，是研究将 Shopify 的所有代码合并为一个巨大的单体仓库（monorepo，将所有代码放在一个版本控制仓库中）的优缺点，我们正在勾画所需的目录结构和工具，以及……\n\nTobi Lütke (00:52:00):\n……以及我们需要的工具。再说一次，单体仓库（monorepo）对于公司来说，非常像是那种“选门 A 还是门 B”的抉择。这是一个影响深远的选择，在公司规模尚小时说“是”是错误的，但在我看来，到了某个阶段，说“是”就变得非常正确，但那时这需要付出巨大的努力。所以，这类事情实际上是我非常有优势去参与的，因为它本质上也是一个业务战略问题。这是一种投资，一个非常真实的投资，即决定：“嘿，让我们改变构建系统的方式。让我们找出最好的方式。”\n\n(00:52:47):\n这其中会涉及变更管理（change management）。会有一些人对此持非常强烈的支持或反对意见。坦率地说，“Tobi 这么说了”会有所帮助。这也能压缩大量的时间，因为每个人都知道我的工作方式。任何人都可以带着更好的主意来找我，如果你是对的，我会改变主意。但在我被说服这些想法不正确之前，我会非常坚持自己的观点。也许这就是你之前提到的“Tobi 龙卷风”（Tobi Tornado）的另一个方面，人们确实会争论。\n\n(00:53:27):\n此外，我们这个时代的美学非常看重一致性。我记得有几位政治家因为被称为“变色龙”（flip-floppers，指立场反复无常的人）而输掉了竞选，对此我……虽然我更倾向于梅纳德·凯恩斯（Maynard Keynes）流派……“当事实改变时，我就改变我的观点。先生，您会怎么做？”这听起来是一个更好的运行系统（OS，此处指思维方式）。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:52):\n这太棒了，因为我正在提取更多关于你思考问题的“算法”。你刚才分享的几点是：第一，你需要深入细节。这就是作为一个第一性原理思考者（first principles thinker）要获得成功的要素；第二，在你的案例中，你需要深入代码细节。在埃隆的案例中，就是制造产品、在工厂里睡地板。正如你所说，他是非常基于“原子”（Adams based）的。而你更像是“数字原生”（digitally native）。然后，不要过度依赖沉没成本。就像你在“Tobi 龙卷风”案例中说的，“我知道你一直在做这个项目，但我们要砍掉它，因为现在换一种做法会更好，而不是因为已经投入了就继续。”然后，回到你之前分享的内容：分析你所走的路径，之前的产出和解决方案都假设了某种路径依赖（path dependence，指受过去决策影响的惯性），不要去看那些它们可能已经过拟合（overfit，指过于契合过去模式而失去通用性）且不再正确的东西。太棒了。好的，这其实是一个很好的过渡，引出了另一个与你共事的人建议我问你的问题，也就是你们的工程主管 Farhan。我问他：“了解 Tobi 思想的最佳途径是什么？”这其实和你刚才描述的思路一致，他的问题是：反驳你（disagree with you）的最佳方式是什么？\n\nTobi Lütke (00:55:02):\n我觉得就是直接反驳我。老实说，我立刻就会爱上这种沟通。我真的很渴望这种反馈。这很有趣。我知道这会让人们感到非常惊讶。我其实更欣赏这种行为，因为它需要勇气，坦率地说，我确实发现……但这也会让我立刻更加信任那个人，部分原因是我首先认为他们会做自己认为正确的事情，而不是做方便的事情。顺从群体往往要方便得多。但更重要的是，他们有足够的勇气在那个时刻就指出来。我认为勇气是非常、非常罕见的。我在行业中见过的“高智商”比“勇气”多得多。我见过的“天才”甚至都比“勇气”多。我喜欢勇气。我希望这不需要太大的勇气。这就是为什么我试图表现得非常欢迎反驳。\n\n(00:56:08):\n当有人不同意我的观点时，我倾向于立即停下来问：“酷，让我们弄清楚为什么会有分歧。”我发现，这种分歧几乎从不是因为“我只是觉得我们应该换个方式”。我寻找的是那些未陈述的基础性假设（unstated foundational assumptions）。我们的分歧点在哪里？因为你可能是对的。事实上，我发现当讨论到这一步时，人们通常是对的。有时候是因为我持有的一些未陈述的基础假设是不正确的。人们告诉我之后，我很庆幸我们讨论了这件事，因为我再也不会在这个问题上纠结了，因为现在我知道我们不能这么做是受限于《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》（Sarbanes-Oxley，针对上市公司的监管法案）之类的规定。这就像是，“喔，太酷了。”我对《萨班斯-奥克斯利法案》（针对上市公司的监管规定）的心智模型（mental model）并不完美。我没有深入研究它的所有细节，所以当我提出我们应该以某种方式解决眼前的任务时，我的大脑里没有参考这些细节。所以，这非常好。\n\n(00:57:24):\n如何反驳？我真的很喜欢辩论。如果大家都同意某件事，我会主动扮演“魔鬼代言人”（devil's advocate，指故意持相反观点以激发讨论）。同样，特别是如果一个提议感觉是我在进入会议之前就能预料到的，且其中没有任何令人惊讶的地方，我会把自己变成一个“关底大 Boss”（end boss），然后说：“我要说，这还不够好。我觉得我们可以做得更好。”我希望人们能针对决策的真实性进行更深入的辩论，这就会导致某种形式的分歧。我认为所有这些最终都会建立起信任。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):\n我喜欢这一点，它也触及了这样一个想法：再次强调，要最大化潜力，包括团队的潜力和员工的潜力。\n\nTobi Lütke (00:58:14):\n因为当然，那些真正重要的决策，我们并不公开讨论。这是最重要的一点。Shopify 每天可能会做出……多少个？……数百万个决策，比如：用这种方式写这段代码，是的，我要添加这个单元测试（unit test），或者也许我跳过了一个单元测试。这可能就是未来生产审计（production audit）时的差别。数以百万计的微小决策。所以，你雇用的主要不是工程师或会计师，而是那些在各自专业领域和管辖范围内能做出卓越决策的人。既然如此，我发现“决策制定”（decision making）作为一个概念，实际上被研究得非常不够。\n\n(00:58:59):\n我认为在这些实例中，我们可以学习共同做出决策。因为虽然很多决策是独立做出的，但我们是一家产品公司，我们身负使命，我们希望我们的产品感觉就像是由一个人做出来的，就像任何作家都试图写出一本读起来显然出自一个大脑的书一样。因为如果不是这样，人们一眼就能看出来。你最终会得到一个看起来像电视遥控器的东西，这里有一个 Netflix 按钮……就像你可以从遥控器上反向推导[听不清 00:59:41]一样。这很重要。\n\n(00:59:48):\n利用这些时刻，也将决策制定的过程向内引入，去说：嘿，让我们为尽可能多的人提供高效的机会，让他们聚在一起共同决策。不是以民主的方式，而是明确谁需要说服谁。否则，这最终会耗费太长时间。给每个人一个改变我或 Glenn 等人想法的机会，我发现这是一个极好的实践。我认为这是一种更优的处理方式。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\n说到不同意，这让我想起了一个我听过的故事，其实是关于“Tobi 龙卷风”以及你的运作方式。我太喜欢了。它最终成了你第一性原理思维的一个有趣的缩影。故事是，我想你曾在某个时刻说过，让人们给你提供见解的最佳方式是在互联网上说一些他们不同意的话。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:42):\n是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:44):\n这通常也是你采取的方式——你在 Slack 群组里发帖说：“嘿，我觉得这个产品行不通，原因如下。”这最终为你创造了最多的信息。关于这方面，还有什么有用的经验可以分享吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:00:56):\n我不认为那是我的最佳方式之一。我必须得谨慎一点。对于那些我共事很久的人，我会这么做，纯粹是因为有趣。但我也能看出来，那会让实习生压力巨大。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\n你们有很多实习生。我想 Farhan 分享过，你们明年会有 1,000 名实习生。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:20):\n是的，我们刚开始这个计划。我昨天在办公室，到处都是实习生。太棒了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):\n噢，伙计。我也喜欢实习生，非常有活力。你刚才分享的关于打造单一产品、朝着一个愿景努力的想法，让我想起了一件事，基本上每次我有 Shopify 的人来参加节目都会提到，那就是你持有的“百年愿景”（100-year vision）。我不知道还有哪家公司是以这种方式运作的，创始人拥有一个关于产品未来走向的百年愿景，并以此进行倒推。\n\n(01:01:48):\n你能谈谈那种运作方式吗？为什么你觉得它有帮助，以及它实际上是如何运作的？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:01:54):\n我经常谈论“望向未来，然后向后思考”。关于这件事，我们希望 20 年前、10 年前或 5 年前做了什么？未来的我们会希望现在的我们做出什么样的决策？这很有用。我发现“未来展望”（future casting）通常极具价值。我建立 Shopify 绝对不是为了卖掉它。我有很多机会把 Shopify 卖给各种各样的人。我从未考虑过，因为这段旅程太有趣了，而且我觉得那样太……如果所有公司的终点[听不清 01:02:34]都是归于那四五个买得起它们的巨头，我认为那会在思维上造成太多的“单一文化”（monoculture）。\n\n(01:02:43):\n我喜欢 Shopify 的与众不同。我认为这很好。我认为对很多、很多人来说，这是一个糟糕的工作场所；但对某些人来说，它是世界上最好的工作场所。这太好了。我认为这就是我们想要的。我们想要更多这样的公司。我们希望人们能够“货比三家”（window-shop），找到一个他们可以获得巨大成功的地方，因为那个地方的一套信念对你来说就像手套一样契合。\n\n(01:03:14):\n100年。我们有着非常长期的计划。如果是100年的跨度，你无法谈论具体的软件产品，但你可以谈论使命本身，谈论那些在剩下的80年里能够幸存下来的东西。创业精神（Entrepreneurship）是弥足珍贵的。Shopify之所以存在，本质上是为了让创业变得更普遍。这是我们想要在世界上促成的事情。我认为我们已经取得了一些成功，但同样，这件事情没有速度限制，也没有终点。正如我一直说的，这个世界具有难以置信的路径依赖（Path dependent，指事物的发展受制于其过去所做的决策）。因此，如果我们是这条路径的一部分，我们就能促使它更符合我们所珍视并希望看到的事物。这就是建立公司最奇妙的地方：它们可以产生持久的影响。\n\n(01:04:16):\n我们基于自己能做的一切事情来做决定。哪些事情对我们所从事的长期追求最具长期价值？我们如何让创业成为一种常态？这对我来说真的很重要，因为人们在这上面花的时间还不够。这一切都关乎经济学。我们的生活水平完全取决于商业。我们都是这种极具创业精神的环境的一部分，而这个环境实际上将创业颂扬为一种勇敢的行为，甚至是一种光荣的行为。\n\n(01:05:02):\n但在世界的大部分地方并非如此。事实上，大多数人从未遇到过从事创业的人。人们并不认为创业是他们的选择之一。我希望我们能做出这些选择。我认为长期主义的视角至关重要，它对决策也非常有帮助。我知道这对大多数人来说可能符合直觉，但实际上却很少被实践。你的节目邀请过很多来自 Stripe 的人。Stripe 和 Shopify 有着非常长期的合作伙伴关系。Stripe 和 Shopify 之间可能拥有技术史上最有价值的合作伙伴关系之一，或者至少是顶级之一。因为当时我们都是非常小的公司，我们决定：“嘿，让我们基于‘我们双方最终都会赢得各自市场’的假设来共同努力。”所以，Stripe [语音模糊 01:06:02] 负责支付，我们是 Stripe 的一部分，诸如此类。\n\n(01:06:07):\n当你处于这样的合作伙伴关系中时，你基本上是在玩重复囚徒困境（Iterated prisoner's dilemma，博弈论模型，指双方多次博弈以达成长期合作）。在每一个实例、每一个回合中，你都可以做一个选择：协作还是背叛。如果对方协作你却背叛，或者对方背叛你却协作。如果双方都协作，每个人都会得一分。如果一个人背叛而另一个协作，背叛者会在那一瞬间获得很多分数。在商业中做一个好的合作伙伴，就像是企业版的“棉花糖测试”（Marshmallow test，心理学中衡量延迟满足的实验），而公司往往会以一种非常滑稽的方式失败。\n\n(01:06:44):\n如果你看过孩子们做真正的棉花糖测试的视频，聪明的孩子会转过椅子，避开棉花糖，坐在自己的手上，全身颤抖。因为他们知道，为了将来能得到两颗棉花糖，现在等待才是正确的，但是，天哪，如果他们盯着棉花糖看，他们就会吃掉它。大多数 CEO、大多数公司甚至无法成功做到这一点，他们只会忙于以折扣价预支未来的利润，甚至背叛那些在长期来看更有价值的合作伙伴关系。\n\n(01:07:16):\n如果你谈论的是长达100年的时间跨度，那结论是毫无疑问的。显而易见，玩重复囚徒困境的正确方式是双方都协作。长期坚持协作的价值，远比任何暂时的、看似方便的背叛所带来的利益要大得多。这会影响大量的细节决策。当我们决定路线图（Roadmap）时，最终会受到这种思维的极大影响。因为我总能收到各种提案，建议我们该做这个，或者为什么不对系统做那样的改动，说那样能赚很多钱等等。我的反应通常是：很酷，但这些建议几乎总是以折现的方式预支未来的利润。\n\n(01:08:08):\n但我们有很长的时间视野。让我们不要接受那种折现，让我们……此外，一段时间后你往往会损害整个业务，因为你最终只是在……如果你的公司进入了价值榨取（Value extraction，指不创造新价值而是从现有系统或客户中榨取利润）阶段，你的客户是会察觉到的。我相信，最优秀的公司（至少从领导者的角度来看）类似于某种驾驶舱，或者是一个装满了货币化（Monetization）拨盘或杠杆的房间。我的工作是向房间里添加尽可能多的这些杠杆，然后一个都不去拉动。因为我认为，如果我们与客户站在桌子的同一边，帮助他们成为企业家（这是我们的使命），并支持他们变得更加成功（这是我们的商业模式），我们就能做得最好。在我们的货币化系统中，我们只从销售额中提取极小的一部分。因此，我们的动力是让每个人都尽可能地成功。\n\n(01:09:11):\n再说一次，当我收到投资银行家之类的 PowerPoint 简报，告诉我拥有巨大的定价权（Pricing power）并可以大幅改变价格时，我的反应是：“是的，但如果这种事发生在我身上，我会离开 Shopify，所以这怎么能算好事呢？”他就会一脸困惑：“为什么？”情况就是这样。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:30):\n你在某处写过一句话，对我来说非常精辟地概括了这一点：“在足够长的时间线上，与你的客户玩正和博弈（Positive-sum games，指多方共赢而非零和竞争）是终极的增长黑客（Growth hack）手段。”是的，太精辟了。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:46):\n我觉得这句话很简练，而且……试着反驳它看看。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:53):\n确实如此。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:09:54):\n正和博弈具有令人难以置信的回报，尤其是在软件世界里，你可以非常容易地体验到指数级增长。我将公司建设看作是……我希望有比国际象棋更好的比喻，因为国际象棋是一个完全信息博弈，这在商业中完全不成立。但关于国际象棋作为商业比喻，我喜欢的一点是，它基本上是两种游戏，你必须精通两者。有一种是位势博弈（Positional game，指通过布局获得长期优势）：发展你的棋子，通过棋子对棋盘施加影响力。这非常非常重要。然后是战术（Tactics），这是你通过战术训练学到的。你去使用拼图训练器（Puzzle trainer），反复练习战术，培养对战术的直觉。这两者实际上是相互独立的。\n\n(01:10:53):\n商业世界只谈论战术。它只谈论“我们做了这件事”带来的转化。我们做了一个 A/B 测试（A/B test，对比实验），把蓝色改了改，结果转化率上升了。我们崇尚这些简单的黑客手段。老实说，我不认为那很重要。你必须具备足够的战术能力才不至于倒闭。你不能收到追加保证金通知（Margin call，在此指财务红线或生存危机），这是肯定的。但是，如果你真正在玩位势博弈，你所有可能采用的战术价值的总和才会留在你身边。\n\n(01:11:36):\n位势博弈就像是：你在地图上占据了什么领土？你扮演什么角色？商户对你有多大程度的信任？商户是想要从你这里得到更多，还是更少？你是那种他们试图从软件支出中优化掉的东西，还是他们请求你合并所有其他软件支出的那种存在？他们依赖你吗？你是团队的一员，还是只是工具箱里的一个工具（通常被遗忘，只有在完成特定任务时才拿出来）？你的产品涵盖了什么？你针对的是哪些行业？等等。这就是位势博弈。棋子之间的契合度如何？人们是否喜欢加深对你的依赖？\n\n(01:12:25):\n如果你做得好，战术就尽在掌握，你可以雇佣很多非常擅长发现并利用战术的人。但如果你过度使用战术，你最终会通过战术榨取掉你所创造的全部价值——也就是那些你在位势博弈中本可以长期持有的价值。如果你这样做，你的油箱里就什么都不剩了。这就是我们都见过的一些公司，它们发展到了一定程度，然后就销声匿迹了。那些就是因为过度追求战术而失去了位势（Position）的公司。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\n这种技能显然是在短期（正如你所说的，不收到追加保证金通知）与长远思考之间找到平衡。\n\n(01:13:09):\n对于那些正在听节目的创始人，他们可能会问：“我该怎么做？我应该花多少精力思考未来，花多少精力思考现在？”有没有什么启发法（Heuristic，一种简化问题的思维法则）？你如何尝试绘制这个饼图，既能立即推动目标并向投资者展示我们表现出色，同时又在未雨绸缪？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:13:22):\n有没有好的启发法？目标第一位是：别死。再说一次，最终成为历史性公司的，都是那些没死掉的公司。这听起来也很基础，但实际上它比看起来更具可操作性。除此之外，我会认为：只专注于位势博弈。我认为这就是创始人与公司其他成员之间有时存在的分歧所在。我认为创始人为人们创造了有限的、可赢的游戏，而这些游戏在很大程度上服务于使命所暗示的无限游戏（Infinite game，指目标不是为了赢而是为了让游戏进行下去），即提升在棋盘上的位势质量。\n\n(01:14:14):\n顺便说一句，这是一个无限的棋盘。就把国际象棋棋盘想象成最初的地形，但上面有战争迷雾（Fog of war），这是一个大得多的地形，你会随着时间的推移去探索。我认为这是在心理上思考建立公司体验的最美妙的方式。这是一种探索，也是对使命所隐含的问题的协作探询。在此过程中，你将探索你的使命有多正确，以及你的决策有多好。你会学到很多东西，这就是为什么我认为这是一件有价值的事情。\n\n(01:14:55):\n但创始人的想法往往与公司的使命是一致的，然而，这些再次强调，是无法量化的事物。它们是追求。也许它们的时间跨度超过了我们所有人职业生涯的时间跨度，因此很难让人们现在就深入关注。但他们确实关心过程中的实例、具体的游戏、为了探索地图的一部分而必须完成的任务[语音模糊 01:15:24]、必须执行的战术。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:29):\n我不打算在这个话题上展开，但我知道你是《有限与无限的游戏》（Finite and Infinite Games）这本书的大粉丝。我曾经在读书会上读过它，它彻底震撼了我的思维。我会附上链接，大家应该去看看。你在另一个播客上也谈过这个，我就不再[语音模糊 01:15:40]。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:15:40):\n是的，那是一本很棒的书。詹姆斯·卡斯（James Carse）做了一件了不起的、被低估的工作……我认为他本质上写了一本最好的商业书。虽然他本意是想写一本严肃的哲学书，我不确定它是否达到了预期的目的，但我认为他实际成就的价值更高。或许，悲哀的是，他可能在去世前都不知道这一点，那确实很令人遗憾。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):\n对人们来说读起来有点难……\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:08):\n是的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\n……所以我的建议是，坚持读下去，试着去理解他到底想表达什么。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:16:14):\n我认为阅读……我不知道具体是几章，但是……前几章真的能帮你理解这个故事和他的洞察。书的其余部分是他想法的应用案例。我读完那些案例后的感受是，他并没有完全理解自己想法的深刻内涵。那些案例最终变得非常局部化且视角狭隘。这是一个比他所展现的要宏大得多的想法……这就是为什么我说我不认为他完全理解了自己想法的质量，这……\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):\n我觉得我们需要一个 Tobi 版本的这本书，加上前言，以及……\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:02):\n我听说赛门·西奈克（Simon Sinek）[写过相关内容]……\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:04):\n嗯。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:04):\n...写了一本类似书名的书。我其实一直没抽出时间读，但我觉得如果那是他的初衷，他会非常擅长解读它。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\n听起来确实是那样。我觉得他的书就是那本书，只是用另一种方式写的。\n\n(01:17:15):\n我想回到你之前谈到的一点，就是关注创业精神以及与你们合作的商家。对我来说，这是另一个“最大化人类潜能”的例子。我是这样想的，人们总是谈论 Y Combinator、斯坦福大学以及所有这些孕育了这么多公司和创始人的地方。但如果你仔细想想，Shopify 所做到的规模比这些要大出几个数量级，而且我觉得你们在这方面没有得到应有的认可——你们创造了那么多的业务，改变了那么多人的生活。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:43):\n那是因为我们不想要这些功劳。这就是重点。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\n这是一个平台该有的态度吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:47):\n我们不想要这份功劳。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:47):\n不想要。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:17:48):\n我的意思是，也许就算你想得到它，你也可能得不到，但我们不需要去探讨这个问题，因为我们实际上、字面上就不想要这份功劳。Shopify 是一家“从背后推动”的公司。我们不想被写进故事里。我们只想……\n\nTobi Lütke (01:18:00):\n……不想被写进故事里，我们只想让你做你自己的事。想要站在最前台表现得太伟大了。这也是为什么我们选择去帮助人们建立属于他们自己的事业，而不是做一个 Marketplace（中心化市场/平台），让每个人按照某种价格租用其中一个小组件，而那个价格通常会神奇地精准吃掉你的利润，Marketplace（市场平台）通常就是这么运作的。所以，是的，我想我们不想要那份功劳。我为此感到自豪，但那是 Intrinsic（内在的）自豪。我想我不需要太多 Extrinsic（外在的）赞赏。每天有成千上万、数以百万计的人在使用 Shopify，这代表了我们的业务，它实际上在世界各地创造了大量的就业机会，尤其是在北美和欧洲。所以我认为这非常令人欣慰。当然，我也敢肯定，即使没有 Shopify，很多生意可能也会存在。\n\n(01:19:18):\n但我同时也认为，你可以论证很大一部分业务是因为 Shopify 才存在的，因为我们观察到了一点——这是我在整个 Shopify 创业历程中最喜欢的一点，也是我们严谨确定的事实：因为我非常、非常、非常看重好的 UX（User Experience，用户体验）和清晰的界面。你可以通过优秀的 UX（用户体验）来驯服巨大的复杂性，让它对人们来说变得有意义。我认为这实际上是软件开发的一种“道义责任”，因为当软件变得难用时，它会让人们觉得自己很蠢，而在我的观念里，机器不应该对人产生负面影响。这颠倒了优先级——机器应该是人类使用的工具，让人们在原本擅长的事情上变得比想象中更强大。这就是一切需要契合的地方。但除了这个道义点之外（这可能需要十年时间去验证，你当然也可以持反对意见），我们所确定的是：每当我们把一件复杂的事情变简单，平台上就会诞生更多的业务。\n\n(01:20:38):\n我认为这在直觉上，或者至少在方向上是成立的，但有时人们会质疑：“你难道不需要拥有所有这些功能吗？”这就是软件世界的 RFP（Request for Proposal，需求建议书/招标说明书）视角，对吧？“你难道不需要拥有所有的功能，然后人们才能执行他们的计划吗？”不，并不是这样。想想创业者的心理状态，他们，尤其是第一次创业的人，是不成熟的。他们不知道该做什么。他们有点害怕。顺便说一句，投身于创造某些东西是一种纯粹的勇气行为，而且通常很难瞒住别人。你身边的人都会知道你在做这件事。去问问任何一位创业者吧，告诉他们“不要做这件事”的人多得令人吃惊。人们不希望看到有人跳出那个既有的、周围人都能理解的条框，去追求更高的目标，因为那会在某种程度上否定他们自己的人生故事。\n\n(01:21:38):\n所以实际上已经有很多 Nay-saying（唱反调/否定意见）在打消人们的积极性了，这已经很没帮助了。现在你面临的情况是：人们可能在劝你放弃，你大概也没多少钱，你还在问自己做得对不对。希望能有一些鼓励的元素，希望能有激情，希望能创造一些东西。接着，你遇到了一些让你目瞪口呆的情况，比如软件突然开始谈论 API（Application Programming Interface，应用程序编程接口），这是你这辈子从未接触过的东西；或者你认为在文本配置页面上应该有的选项，在当地税务等知识背景下变得毫无意义。情况就是这样。所以 Shopify 的美妙之处在于，基本上没有“税务配置页面”。它就是正确的。软件的神奇之处在于，我们可以直接接管这部分复杂性。\n\n(01:22:53):\n我们知道各地的税收政策，我们直接帮你做了。你不需要去考虑税务。在这种情况下，如果你让某人遇到了阻碍他们、让他们不知所措的事情，在运气不好的那天，这意味着他们会关掉浏览器并说：“去他的，我不是干这个的料。”或者，“我用的这个软件太烂了，它太笨了，理解不了我脑子里的想法，”或者别的什么。每个人对同一件事都有不同的解读，但结果就是——进步停止了。不仅仅是那些本来就不该存在的生意会这样停止。事实上，数据再次表明，很多优秀的业务曾多次非常接近这个放弃点。我可以告诉你，Shopify 也有很多次这种时刻，而且我在创业路上的工具比大多数人都多。我是一个计算机程序员，我热爱这些东西。你告诉我接下来的几年我可以每天花 14 小时编程，我会说：“太棒了，开搞吧。”\n\n(01:24:01):\n大多数人不是那样的。所以我拥有不公平的优势，让我能够克服这个学习曲线中非常技术化的攀爬，但我知道大多数人不可能拥有这些优势，因此他们会在测试中 Churn out（流失/中途退出）。换句话说，降低复杂性、创造良好的 UX（用户体验）、开发能自动处理税务、支付、反欺诈等事务的软件，实际上会催生更多的创业行为。这是我遇到的对我生命中最重要问题的最好答案，因为在此之前，这只是一个直觉，觉得做 Shopify 这件事从绝对意义上、从百年的跨度来看是有价值的。在那之后，我就确信了。所以，这也意味着现在看到那些过度复杂或根本不该存在的东西时，我会感到生理上的痛苦，因为我知道，所有这些试图有所成就、本来可以存在、可以雇佣员工并取悦客户的业务，都因为我们做得不对或做得不好而半路夭折了。所以，这是我继续前进的巨大动力源泉。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:26):\n我能感受到那种痛苦，那种想到如果按钮坏了，或者颜色不对，导致转化率下降，就意味着没能创造出那么多业务、那么多创业者的痛苦。你描述的那种害怕发布东西的感觉，我在创办 Newsletter（时事通讯/邮件订阅）时完全感受到了。我当时的解决方案是，发布时告诉自己：“这只是一个实验。我们看看它会走向何方，别担心。我可能只是偶尔写写博客。”这真的很有帮助，降低了 Stake（筹码/心理负担），我能明白像这样的小事和建议是如何帮助某人跨过那个坎的。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:26:01):\n是的，我认为这是 UX（用户体验）领域中一个尚未被充分探索的领域。举个随机的例子，我非常惊喜地发现——也许 TikTok 也有同样的功能，我不知道——但我之前在 Instagram 上发布视频时，它允许我进行 Reel（短视频）的 Try run（试运行）。这看起来像是个新功能，它会把视频展示给粉丝圈以外的几百个人，如果他们喜欢，它才会发布到我的个人主页上。我心想：“我不需要这个。”但随后我觉得那是……老实说，我关掉 Instagram 后就在想：“天哪，这可能是我见过的最深刻、最有见地的软件设计之一。”作为一个好点子的鉴赏家，我以前从未觉得这竟然是个如此有价值的东西。它感觉像是对传统 A-B Test（对比测试）概念的一次 Step function（阶跃式/量级）升级，因为它太容易理解了。我在想：“世界上还有什么东西应该有这种针对外部圈子的 Try run（试运行）？” 基本上所有事情都应该有，不是吗？\n\n(01:27:03):\n这是一件了不起的事情。就像我说的，世界上最稀缺的东西甚至不是创意或天才，而是勇气。所以，让我们降低所需的“净勇气值”吧。老实说，这可能是那种你可以投入整个职业生涯或用来重塑一个行业的事情。如果你真的追求这些东西，并从 First principles（第一性原理）出发，而不是仅仅思考“我如何凭借洞察力把我想做的事做得稍微好一点”，它们就会演变成惊人的价值。把事做得更好当然很好，大家也应该一直这样做，但通常当一个新点子出现时，那并不是大部分价值最终体现的地方。我居然在激进地谈论一个 Instagram 的功能，这有点奇怪，但我确实感到非常愉悦，因为这是几天前才刚出现的。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:54):\n我喜欢关于“勇气”的这个思路。你举的例子也让我想起，第一次在不同的城市打开约会软件（Dating app）也是这种例子，那就像是一次试运行，没人认识你。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:06):\n但即便如此，难道不应该有一个功能说：“嘿，把我的简介发布到另一个城市，告诉我这行不行。”\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):\n看看大家喜不喜欢。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:14):\n我是说，我基本上从未约会过，至少在过去 25 年里没有。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):\n是的，毕竟是在录播客（笑）。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:28:20):\n所以我是在“左右滑动”约会时代之前的人，所以我对这方面的概念很模糊。也许我应该多看看约会软件，我敢肯定大多数产品中都有一些惊人的 UX（用户体验）。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):\n我能想象。我感觉约会正在变得越来越向线下回归。我觉得那是人们现在尝试的方向，他们厌倦了滑动。但无论如何，不往那个方向扯了。趁你还在，我再问几个问题。一个是关于 Talent Stack（人才栈/技能组合）的想法。你之前提到过这个概念，我也见过你用这个词来描述这种观点：专注于你独特的才华和好奇心，这会引导你走向巨大的机会，尤其是在职业生涯早期。你能谈谈你在这方面的见解吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:29:04):\n是的，再说一次，我只活了一次，所以我无法通过蒙特卡洛模拟 (Monte Carlo，一种统计模拟方法) 来分析我做的所有决定，并弄清楚哪些决定最终成为了关键支撑（load bearing），对吧？目前，我对不断发生的以下现象感到非常有趣：我开始对一些完全随机的事物产生好奇，而且真的是一些非常冷门的东西，然后就像变魔术一样，一年后，这些东西竟然成了让我做出非常重要选择的关键。它可能最终变成了一个我学到的更好的类比，或者一种看待事物的不同方式，或者我在这个专业领域发现的另一个想法，而它其实只是另一个基础理念的重新包装，这让我能够去寻找更多的例子。\n\n(01:29:57):\n这种方式很有趣。所以即使在职业生涯早期，我也只是追随我的好奇心。我热爱编程，热爱计算机，当互联网出现时我也热爱它，我当时就想：“酷，我要找一个我觉得有价值的任务。”我一直对零售业（retail）很感兴趣，对于互联网应该如何把零售带给人们，我有很深见解。但这（Shopify）正是所有我感兴趣的事物的美好交汇点。在此之上，我发现了 Ruby，那是我非常喜爱的一项技术。当时我非常有动力去钻研和探索一个显然正在兴起、且在未来显然非常有价值的领域。\n\n(01:30:44):\n但我这么做并不是为了追逐金钱。我这么做是因为我喜欢通过实践来学习，我喜欢钻研事物。所以，通过卖单板滑雪板来为我的钻研提供资金（这就是 Shopify 的前身），然后它引导我走向了其他领域。我一直以来都在做这类事情。这对我来说很有趣，非常有意思。我不知道这算不算什么建议，但也许这是一个可以运作得很好的证明。不过我有时也会担心，像这样的事情最终会变得有点像“你只需要买张彩票”，对于中奖者来说确实如此，对吧？所以，谁知道呢。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:30):\n这确实能引起共鸣。这让我想起了布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗 (Brian Armstrong，Coinbase 创始人) 曾经分享过的一些内容，那就是他之所以……\n\nTobi Lütke (01:31:37):\n顺便说一下，如果你要开始培养一批“第一性原理思考者” (first principle thinkers)，你必须把他加入其中。我认为有很多成功的初创公司创始人、CEO，特别是上市公司的 CEO，在展现出来的特质上惊人地相似，虽然可能背景略有不同。顺便说一下，布莱恩在这方面（第一性原理思考）非常强。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):\n好的，他是下一位被播客提名的嘉宾，布莱恩，我们会联系他的。但有趣的是，对于是什么让他创立了 Coinbase，他给出的建议几乎一模一样：他的背景是经济学、编程和密码学（cryptography）之类的。这就是那个韦恩图 (Venn diagram)，就像是：“这就是我独特擅长的领域，也是我有机会获胜的机会。”\n\nTobi Lütke (01:32:29):\n是的。这也是我们非常积极地告诉客户的。凯文·凯利 (Kevin Kelly) 在 2005 年写过一篇文章，说：“在未来的互联网上，你只需要一千个铁杆粉丝 (1,000 true fans)。”这就是互联网，也是 Shopify 所推崇的：不要试图去制造牙膏，虽然市场巨大但很难做出差异化。更好的做法是找到三个不同事物的三重交汇点，并把它做到极致。我和我的儿子以及家人在加勒比海度过了一个冬假，我喜欢和他们一起玩扑克。我喜欢玩扑克，这是一个伟大的信息不完全博弈（limited information game）。我认为这对孩子很有价值。所以我找到了这个，我可能在某些地方提到过，我记得叫“海盗金币”之类的。\n\n(01:33:32):\n这是一套非常棒的扑克筹码，看起来就像直接从《加勒比海盗》里的藏宝箱里拿出来的一样。想想这个交汇点：在线德州扑克 (Texas Hold'em)、高质量的扑克套装，而不是……因为你可以用任何东西玩，对吧？人们在市场上愿意花钱买这样的东西，而且是海盗主题的。你会觉得：“但我太喜欢它了，我正在告诉你这件事，人们可能会因为我的热忱而真的去购买它。”因为热情其实是最好的营销。他们至少有一千个铁杆粉丝。比起做一个每个人可能都想要、或者说能忍受的东西，为一部分人做出惊艳的东西要好得多。我认为这真的很棒。我觉得这同样适用于你的职业生涯，因为顺便说一下，我们都是创业者，所以我们要随时思考任何职业。\n\n(01:34:36):\n如果你真的向我咨询职业建议，我会说：我们本身就是产品，我们正在参与创业。如果你愿意，我们基本上就是“软件即服务” (SaaS) 或者“人才即服务” (Talent as a Service)。我们以“雇佣”的形式出售订阅服务，但坦白说，这其实只是“订阅”换了个说法，因为它带有一些额外的保护，这很好，但本质是一样的，这是一个双向选择（double opt-in）的公司。就像你会说，我可以做这些事，我对公司的价值将显著高于你花在我身上的成本。理想情况下，对公司来说应该有一个正向的投资回报率 (ROI)，公司要么说“我同意”，要么说“我不同意”。这就是雇佣的本质。所以人们应该把自己看作一个产品。你的职业生涯并不取决于你找到的导师，也不取决于你是否获得晋升。\n\n(01:35:34):\n而在于你在哪些方面做到了“优秀到不容忽视”？你能有多出色？你能做到绝对的……你能做到卓越吗？我的意思是你不必在所有事上都达到世界级水平，但你必须……理想情况下，你会找到一个拥有大约五个交汇点的微小空间，在那里你比任何人都了解得更多，然后所有人都会打电话找你。就像我说的，我们使用 Ruby 语言。Ruby 以前并不快，Shopify 希望它能非常快。我们找到了那些在动态语言、垃圾回收（garbage collection）和即时编译（JIT, Just-in-time compilation）方面获得博士学位的人，专门为了让 Ruby 变快。他们在 Shopify 度过了愉快的时光，而现在的 Shopify 运行得非常快，非常好。每个人都能从我们的需求中获益，因为我们把它合并回了 Ruby 核心（Ruby Core），现在每个人都可以拥有 JIT 编译器了。这太棒了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):\n我觉得每个故事都像一个分形，可以延伸出好几个小时的其他播客对话。我知道你还得去管理那间九千、一万人的公司，去做真正的工作。所以我们就聊到这里。我们几乎聊完了我希望涵盖的所有内容，但我还有无限多的问题。在结束之前，你有什么想留给听众的吗？有什么你没提到的最后一点感悟吗？\n\nTobi Lütke (01:37:03):\n如果我能再次与关注产品和产品管理的人交谈，我想说的是，这在之前的谈话中可能只是含蓄地表达了出来：世界上每件产品的质量，归根结底都只是反映了它的创造者对该产品的“在意程度” (how much they gave a shit)。如果工作的人不在意这个产品，就不可能做出伟大的产品。我实际上认为这是产品领导者的一个非常重要的角色：确保团队真正地在意产品。我认为这可以通过与用户建立共情（empathy）来实现，也可以由产品领导者以一种传染的方式来实现。产品领导者必须非常在意。不要从事你不在意的产品工作，因为你做不出那个给你任务的人所期望的东西。\n\n(01:38:04):\n我觉得很多东西都包含在我们之前进行的这场无法量化的对话中，但这真的非常重要。因为这不仅仅是关于需求文档（brief document），不仅仅是关于协调利益相关者。有时候在某些地方，这些确实是其中的一部分，我认为它们有时与人的表现相关。但我认为更高级别的逻辑是：如果你在做产品，你基本上有几条路。你必须让团队坐稳，观察他们看不到的潜在问题（look around corners）。你必须比其他任何人都更了解这件事，因为这就是你的角色。你不必独自完成，团队中的每个人都是你的资源，你可以向他们请教，从而确定“弯道后有什么”，无论是在工程还是用户体验（UX）等方面，这都非常重要。第二，你必须以一种“放热式地” (exothermically) 散发感染力，让大家真正关心这件事。因为单凭这一件事就能让产品好上十倍。这种改变带来的影响大得惊人。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:25):\n我觉得你描述的其实就是“创始人模式” (founder mode) 的产出：极度在意、放热式的兴奋、以及预见潜在问题。我觉得这本身就是另一个话题了。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:39:37):\n是的，我同意。我不认为“创始人模式”……我的意思是，“创始人模式”是一个非常有价值的词。但我确实认为，我在之前讨论关于“向系统注入热量”时，已经回答了关于我对创始人模式看法的问题。这就是我所做的。只是在创始人经营的公司中，这种模式更容易存在，因为人们往往不喜欢那些向系统“注入热量”的人。人们会反抗他们，甚至排挤他们。但如果老板就是这样的人，老板就可以保护其他也这样做的人。因此，我认为创始人经营的公司创新能力可以维持得更久，因为有一种土壤（substrate）可以让这种特质长期存在。总之，这就是我对“创始人模式”讨论的分析，我认为这是最近一个非常引人入胜的讨论。我觉得它非常有价值。我确定它在各方面都被人误解了，但我觉得它比人们想象的更具可操作性。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:40):\nTobi，非常感谢你尽管要走了还继续分享这些金句。顺便说一下，你的视频画面现在看起来棒极了。这是惊人的剪辑效果，我们就像在你的身上流淌着一道彩虹。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:40:53):\n是的，我们在这里真的遇到了彩虹，就像在说“让我们去发明创造吧”。我希望你得到了你想要的干货（gold，字面意为金币）……\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):\n太多的干货了。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:00):\n……而我在这里作为一个称职的“爱尔兰小矮人” (leprechaun，传说中守护金币的精灵) 把它们送到了。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:05):\n多么精彩的比喻。好的，Tobi，非常感谢你参加节目。这太不可思议了。我觉得这会帮助很多人建立伟大的公司，感谢你从第一性原理出发的分享。\n\nTobi Lütke (01:41:13):\n好的，我得走了。拜拜。\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:15):\n好的，拜拜。\n\n(01:41:18):\n非常感谢大家的收听。如果你觉得内容有价值，可以在
