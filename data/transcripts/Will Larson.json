And so like, \"Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work.\" Well, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. And so actually one of the, I think, highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this kind of baseline assumption of like, \"Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems.\" And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well.\n\nLenny (00:00:35):\nToday, my guest is Will Larson, one of the most requested guests I've had on this podcast. Will is currently CTO at Carta. He's been a software engineering leader at Stripe, Uber, and Calm. He's the author of two essential books for all engineers, An Elegant Puzzle and Staff Engineer, and he's releasing his newest book The Engineering Executive's Primer in February of next year. He also publishes regularly on his blog at lethain.com, which is a must read for every engineer and eng leader.\n\n(00:01:05):\nIn our conversation, Will shares advice on developing your engineering strategy and strategy in general, how to improve the relationship between an eng manager and a PM, how he finds time to write, while also working an intense full-time job, how he recommends approaching measuring engineering productivity, how to develop your company values, an amazing story about his time at Digg and so much more. Will is such a gem of a human and leader and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Will Larson after a short word from our sponsor.\n\n(00:01:39):\nToday's episode is brought to you by DX, a platform for measuring and improving developer productivity. DX is designed by the researchers behind frameworks such as Dora, Space and DevEx. If you've tried measuring developer productivity, you know that there are a lot of basic metrics out there and a lot of ways to do this wrong. And getting that full view of productivity is still really hard. DX tackles this problem by combining qualitative and quantitative insights, giving you full clarity into how your developers are doing.\n\n(00:02:07):\nDX is used by both startups and Fortune 500 companies, including companies like Twilio, Amplitude, eBay, Brex, Toast, Pfizer, and Proctor and Gamble. To learn more about DX and get a demo of their product, visit their website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.\n\n(00:02:28):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing it. Another date conversion edge-case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences.\n\n(00:03:02):\nFrom embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error online 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.\n\n(00:03:36):\nWill, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nWill Larson (00:03:40):\nThank you so much. Super, super excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:42):\nSo many people have suggested that I bring you on this podcast. You have a lot of fans out there and I am excited to be digging into engineering topics, which we don't do enough of on this podcast. So thank you for making time for this.\n\nWill Larson (00:03:54):\nNo, thanks. I hope to be a good early engineering guest before you pivot entirely to engineering at some point in the future.\n\nLenny (00:04:04):\nWow, I love that. How cool would that be? I was an engineer actually when I started my career. How interesting would that be if we come full circle? Anyway, I thought it'd be fun to start with just what is changing in engineering? It feels like there's been a lot that has changed over the past few years, especially from kind of the ZIRP zero interest rate era to today's market, which is very different. What have you seen most change from an engineer's perspective and then just also what are you telling eng leaders about how to handle all this change?\n\nWill Larson (00:04:32):\nI think it's a pretty strange time in the market. So I think that I started working and right before the 2008 kind of crash. And so the first two years there were not so good. When I joined Yahoo, there was a layoff basically every four months. There was a layoff of some sort. It's pretty chaotic. But then we got into the last decade and it was just smooth. So numbers went up, revenue went up, headcount went up and people started learning how to build really large teams.\n\n(00:05:02):\nPeople started learning how to hire a lot. When I was at Uber, some days I would do six interviews back to back. I would just be in a conference room and at some point you can't even remember who you're talking to because you talk to so many people, one after another after another. You just have some scrambled notes you're trying to decode afterwards.\n\n(00:05:20):\nPretty different now. A lot of engineering managers are spending half their time or more hiring 18 months ago and now they're doing two interviews a month or less. Maybe zero interviews a month. So there's a real shift in just the amount of time people are putting into hiring. Instead, all these different competencies that have become more critical or a really great engineering director might've just been spending their time hiring really well and that could be a top performer and now that person can't actually demonstrate what they're great at.\n\n(00:05:51):\nSo that person might be perceived as a low performer if they're not also figuring out how to lead the team, getting deeper into the details and also sometimes getting into the figuring out what is the right allocation, what is the right sizing of the engineering teams, this is stuff that we weren't talking about much or maybe if you really pissed off the CEO, maybe an infrastructure you just grew a little bit slower next year, but different ballgame at this point where teams are actually disappearing, teams are getting cut down, teams are getting consolidated. And that's just something that we've avoided for that ZIRP era that now we become a core part of a lot of the job.\n\nLenny (00:06:27):\nIt feels like also engineers... They used to have a lot of leverage over companies, inside companies. I imagine that's also changing in a big way.\n\nWill Larson (00:06:37):\nI think that's true. I think this actually has been bad for engineers in some way. One of my hobby horses is that I think that we often treat engineers a little bit like children instead of giving them the responsibilities and ability to actually thrive as adults. And so like, \"Oh, the engineers won't want to do that work.\"\n\n(00:06:53):\nWell, that's actually not good for the engineers to be sheltered from what is important. Actually one of the, I think ,highlights is that I think we're coming back this moment where we can actually treat engineers like our peers and put them into really senior leadership roles and not have this baseline assumption of like, \"Oh, we have to coddle them or hide them from the real problems.\" And this is how they're going to get the opportunity to grow as well. That's a highlight for me and the shift recently.\n\nLenny (00:07:18):\nI have definitely worked with that and experienced that where you don't want to piss off engineers. And so are you saying that because that's changing, leaders maybe don't have to worry as much about upsetting engineers plus you just generally think we shouldn't treat engineers that way?\n\nWill Larson (00:07:33):\nYeah, I think a little bit of both, but I think there's been, in this previous era, where hiring and retention were one of the biggest ways you evaluated middle management. Losing team members was huge, huge issue. And so you started to coddle a little bit, which is actually bad, again, bad for the engineers, bad for the teams, bad for everyone, bad for efficiency of the organization. But now something that I love is we get to give engineers real hard problems and we get to actually hold them accountable. And that means we can put them in senior roles.\n\n(00:08:07):\nOne of the things that I've been pushing on, I wrote my last book, Staff Engineer about what is the career path for senior engineers. One of the challenges is if we aren't comfortable holding engineers accountable because we just want to retain all the engineers, then we can't put them in senior roles. And so I think we're actually seeing a bit of a shift where we can actually hold them accountable, which means we can put them in senior roles, which means the engineers can actually get what they've been trying to get the entire time, but we haven't been able to because we've been coddling them a little bit too much.\n\nLenny (00:08:33):\nOkay. So there's a few directions I want to go and I'm just going to poke around and see where we go. The first is you're a big advocate of systems thinking. We were chatting about this before. I think a lot of people have heard this term systems thinking and there's books about it. It's sounds great. I want to be a systems thinker. What does that actually mean? How do you find you apply it in your work? How do people get better at this way of thinking?\n\nWill Larson (00:08:57):\nA lot of the least successful but smartest people I've worked with were really strong systems thinking advocates. And so I do want to say every kind of framework has a lot of downsides. There's no framework that people can apply consistently, universally, and get good results. And so briefly on this one, what I see is often people will find a spot where their system and reality are in conflict and they'll be like, \"Reality is wrong.\" And so what's a concrete example?\n\n(00:09:28):\nAt Stripe, we worked on incident management. And so Stripe pretty important company where our API is available. If the API is down, you lose money and if you lose a lot of money, you leave Stripe because you're pretty upset about that. The number one thing businesses need to do is to collect money successfully for the service that they're selling, right? Stripe is super important.\n\n(00:09:49):\nAnd so we did a lot of analysis on incidents trying to understand why things weren't working, what we could do better, but we got so caught up in the analysis that we lost track of whether we're actually improving things. And it took us a while to figure that out because we were so stuck in the systems thinking model and it's not like, \"Oh, the team was wrong.\" It's like, \"I was wrong.\" I was caught up in that model myself, to realize like, \"Hey, we weren't actually prioritizing improvements, we were just prioritizing measurement.\" And you can't keep measuring. There's measure twice, cut once. Sure, but you don't measure infinite times and never get to cut.\n\n(00:10:25):\nAnd you do have to cut at some point to actually make impact. But we just got caught a little bit there. I think a lot of people who get too far in systems thinking make the same mistake where they think reality is wrong and reality is never wrong. Reality is always right. Your model is always wrong if it's in conflict with reality. But that conflict, that gap is really interesting and that's where you can learn.\n\n(00:10:49):\nAnd so I had this model. It's really clean. It represents your hiring pipeline that moving through different steps. It represents your incidents and how you remediate incidents. It can model almost anything pretty quickly when you get good at it. And then understanding how reality is in conflict with that, you start to understand where your mental model is wrong and then you can go educate yourself and improve the model and just keep doing that.\n\n(00:11:12):\nAt some point the model is close enough and you can stop doing that and go actually do the work. So that the biggest thing I tell people is this is a great way to learn, but you also have to do things. You can't just learn. That's not our entire job.\n\nLenny (00:11:25):\nTo make it a little more concrete, how would you best describe this idea of systems thinking? What's a good way to just like, \"Okay. I get what you're talking about?\"\n\nWill Larson (00:11:32):\nThis is probably a better place to start versus a rambling anecdote about using it.\n\nLenny (00:11:38):\nWe can go backwards. It'll be great.\n\nWill Larson (00:11:41):\nSystems thinking is basically you try to think about stocks and flows. So stocks are things that accumulate and flows are kind of the movement from a stock to another thing. So what's a simple example of a stock? A stock could be the number of fish in a lake. A stock could be the number of people fishing in a lake. And so a flow between those two could be the number of fish in a lake will decrease at some rate based on the number of people fishing in that lake.\n\n(00:12:08):\nSo if there's a ton of fishers, the stock of fish will go down faster. There's only a couple of fish, IT will go down slower. But also then there's these flows which kind of dictate that where if we've got much more efficient fishermen, the flow of fish out might go down, but also the fish do reproduce. So then there's another flow going back. So based on the current number of fish and the reproduction rate, the current number of fishers and their fishing rate, you start to see how these can evolve over time. And a lot of this.\n\n(00:12:38):\nSo first always recommend Thinking In Systems by Donella Meadows. Really phenomenal book. And a lot of her work is also kind of referencing the work in Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, which talks about how small amount of carcinogens or something low in the ecosystem or the food chain rather as they get consumed by predators further and further up get concentrated. And that's a kind of a classic systems thinking problem to think about where you wouldn't think a small amount of carcinogens and a small fish actually matter. But as they go up the food chain, they start to concentrate it and an unexpected change can happen.\n\nLenny (00:13:14):\nSo then going back to your example of the hiring pipeline, let's come back to that to help connect this definition, which I've never heard, which is awesome, very clear to how you actually implemented say in hiring.\n\nWill Larson (00:13:23):\nThe first thing to do is to get a model out there of any sort. And so you think about your stocks. And so in a hiring pipeline you might have potential candidates and this could be basically infinite, and then you have a couple of inflows. So you could have sourced, you could have outreach, you could have referrals, and then you have the candidates and those... How many people get sourced. There's probably a function of number of sources you have dedicated to a role. So you'd have another stock of how many sources you have and then that would impact the rate going from potential candidates to actual candidates you've sourced.\n\n(00:13:59):\nAnd then from candidates that you have in that box, you'd have a conversion rate for people who pass the first recruiter screen and that would move into step two of your process. And then from step two you have maybe a hiring manager screen and that would be another conversion rate. So you can see over time how the candidates of the infinite potential candidates like wandering around LinkedIn, posting about their deep thoughts, convert into actual people, your first, your second, your third.\n\n(00:14:26):\nBut then as you get deeper into it, you start to actually see interesting things. And so for a lot of candidate or a lot of pipelines, the biggest issue is hiring managers don't want to extend any offers because the hiring managers can't get to confidence on any candidate. And you'll see in this pipeline, you'll see a ton of candidates getting to offer stage, but almost none of them converting from a potential offer to actually offer. And then you can say, \"Hey, here's the problem. You need to go work with the recruiter and the hiring managers on getting conviction about who they should hire.\n\n(00:14:56):\nClassic problem with early managers, right? Here's a second problem. Manager wants to extend a ton of offers. They do extend them and none of them actually accept. And so that focuses you on the second problem. But there's a third potential world where actually you're just not getting enough candidates in. You're actually doing a great job of making decisions, great job of closing candidates. There's just not enough candidates coming in. And so by looking at this and you can build this model, then you can go to your applicant tracking system, a greenhouse or whatever and pull the historicals and you can just see how the historicals work versus how you'd expect it to work.\n\n(00:15:32):\nYou can see the drop-offs and this helps you figure out where should you go try to fix things first. I think we've all worked in companies where you roll out big changes with no data behind them because like, \"Oh, it feels like we're not hard enough in how we evaluate candidates or something.\" You go change a bunch of stuff. But often the real problem might be that the hiring managers making offer extensions to people who never passed the loop anyway. It's just the managers are issuing too many offers because they're panicking. And man, less true now, but a decade... Or not a decade, two years ago, hiring managers panicking to get offers out, that was a real thing that happened a lot. And this just helps you take a complex kind of abstract problem and turn it into something you can actually work in a systematic way.\n\nLenny (00:16:17):\nI feel like product managers will either naturally do it things this way already because a lot of them think in funnels. And it's interesting to hear this version of it of this idea of just following the stock through the flow of the different steps. Awesome. Another thing that I know that you are very passionate about and spend a lot of time thinking about is engineering strategy. I think you have this kind of feeling like engineers don't think enough about the end strategy. Every other function has a strategy and engineers often don't. Talk about what you find there and what your advice is around that.\n\nWill Larson (00:16:52):\nFirst, I start to question whether any function has a strategy at most companies. My general experience is that there's very rarely a written strategy for any company. Sometimes it's a value statement. It's like we build the highest quality products and you're like, \"Good. Okay. What do I do with that?\" You're like, \"Build a high quality product.\" You're like, \"Okay. I don't don't know what that means.\"\n\n(00:17:15):\nEngineering often has this problem where I think people will make comments in their culture amp or their quarterly surveys or whatever. It's like, \"Hey, the strategy is not clear or where's the engineering strategy?\" And the biggest thing I tell people when they complain and then engineers complain about the product strategy. The PMs don't have any strategy or the business has no strategy. And the reality is product eng and business always have a strategy. It's just often not written down.\n\n(00:17:45):\nAnd so the first thing I want to do is I push people not to get caught up on the fact that there's no template out there, which is product strategy that someone has forked and filled in. It doesn't mean you don't have a strategy. You do have a strategy. It's maybe a little bit hard to articulate and maybe it's applied inconsistently across different layers of the product reporting chain because it's not written down. But it's never true that there's no product strategy. There's always a product strategy. Sometimes it's bad, but there's always one. And true for engineering as well. There's always an engineering strategy. Just sometimes it's bad.\n\n(00:18:21):\nThe first rule of strategy is that if you write it down, then you can improve it. If it's not written down, it's hard to say if this PM is just not a good PM or if they're trying to apply the strategy that they've misunderstood or if they actually are correctly applying the strategy from the head of product that's just not appropriate to the problems they're working on, how do you debug any of that?\n\n(00:18:43):\nIf you have a written document, even if it's not a super compelling strategy, at least you can start debugging. It's like, \"Hey, the head of product should improve the clarity of this document. Hey, this DM actually isn't applying it correctly. Hey, the strategy actually isn't appropriate for this one business unit where it makes sense for the others.\"\n\n(00:19:02):\nSo that's the first thing I think about. But the second big theme on strategy I think about is that often good strategy is so boring. It's hard to talk about. For example, on the engineering side of thing, a common strategy that's really good but very boring is we only use the tools we have today. So a lot of times you'll get engineers that want to introduce new programming languages, new databases, new cloud providers. And a really good strategy for almost all companies is like we just use the standard kit we already have today.\n\n(00:19:39):\nAnd at Carta, when I joined one of the engineers, Eric Vogel wrote the standard kit and that is our strategy of the tools we use. And you know what? Some people are really frustrated by that and I feel for them. It feels like they're losing control, but the power of these boring strategies is that it focuses people's energy on the problems that we value as a company. And so it is painful coming into alignment if you're kind of slightly misaligned over time, but boring strategies that tell you what actually matters and aligns you with what the company actually caress about are really good for you even if they're a little bit annoying at a time. And I can expand on this idea a lot, but I won't ramble indefinitely on it.\n\nLenny (00:20:21):\nWell, maybe what might be helpful is what are some other examples of engineering strategies that you've seen just to give people even more just like, \"Oh yeah, maybe this should be part of our strategy.\"\n\nWill Larson (00:20:31):\nSo first, what is a definition of strategy? And the best one I've ever seen is from Richard Rumelt. He wrote Good Strategy, Bad Strategy.\n\nLenny (00:20:40):\nHe's coming on the podcast.\n\nWill Larson (00:20:42):\nAmazing. He also wrote, The Crux I think came out this year sometime, which I also read. I think both great and just a phenomenal thinker who has so much depth. I think one of the challenges of writing about strategy is you're like, I've seen two things and I write the book, but I think the thing that's impressive about Richard Rumelt is he's seen so many different scenarios that he's able to really operate from both the particular but also the general and dataset in a really interesting way. Another book with similar characteristics is How Big Things Get Done by... I forget the authors, but really amazing dataset of how mega projects kind of succeed and fail.\n\n(00:21:21):\nBut anyway, Richard Rumelt, definition of strategy is basically three components. There's a diagnosis. What is the current status quo? What are the things that are real today? There are guiding policies which are basically based on the diagnoses, how do you want to address them? And there's actions. And actions are how are we going to implement these guiding policies. He talks a lot about actions because concerned about this idea of inert strategy where you have like, \"We're going to deprecate our old product features we don't use, but no one deprecates any of them.\"\n\n(00:21:52):\nSo he's really concerned about this non implementation kind of useless strategy that doesn't do anything. On engineering, I'm a little bit less worried about that. I think strategy is more interesting on engineering in terms of clarifying how we make future decisions. And so what are a few examples of that? At Uber, we only used our own data centers. We didn't use the cloud. And this has changed since the era I was there, but in the 2014 era, no cloud, and we had a strict no cloud policy. And this was annoying because we had to indent everything ourselves or run copies of everything ourselves.\n\n(00:22:28):\nBut it also meant that we were able to spin up in China in literally three months and some surreal stories from that. We couldn't fit our racks into the data centers, so they had to take the roof off the data center and lift the racks in with the crane.\n\nLenny (00:22:43):\nHoly shit.\n\nWill Larson (00:22:43):\nJust tons of stories and all this had done in three months and truly phenomenal. And Uber wasn't in China for very long, so in some ways you're like, we did all that just a leave? But they left with a nice stake of Didi Kuaidi and not a bad outcome overall. But I think that strategy, we run everything in data centers. We don't use the cloud, meant we were able to move in and out of different geopolitical constraints and companies that relied on cloud presence simply can't. There are fully constrained by where AWS or Google Cloud or Azure have built out. So that's one good example.\n\n(00:23:21):\nAnother good example at Stripe was this idea of we run a Ruby monolith and that's what we did and that's evolved a bit since then. There's more Java and the Stripe of 2023 than there was in the stripe of 2016 or the 2012 or whatnot. But that policy really focused the engineers on building innovative features for our users rather than building different tooling to support different programming languages. And so in both cases, both the Uber policy around running our own data centers and the Stripe policy around Ruby monoliths, a lot of engineers hated these.\n\n(00:24:02):\nBut the goal of good strategy is not to appease everyone. The goal of good strategy is to dictate how we invest the limited capacities we have or the limited capabilities we have into the problems we care about. And I think both of them were really effective towards that end.\n\nLenny (00:24:17):\nA common theme across all these examples is essentially constraint, deciding we will constrain our options to move faster and focus on the things that really matter.\n\nWill Larson (00:24:28):\nIn solving the constraints is to me, I think the most interesting thing that strategy really does, and I think when we talk about bad strategy usually is because the diagnosis is bad and it's usually because people are exerting what they want to be true on constraints where it's like, \"Hey, we can do all of these projects at once.\" And often that's just not true, but it's hard to convince people that when they're the CEO or they are really committed to believing it, but almost all bad strategies basically come down from a willful disbelief of what an accurate diagnosis is, which means then your guiding policies are kind of incoherent to begin with.\n\nLenny (00:25:08):\nAwesome. I'm excited for that episode of Richard where we're going to go real deep into strategy, but maybe just as a lasting topic around there, if someone listening wanted to get better at say end strategy specifically or a strategy in general, is there anything you recommend they do? Is it read these books? Is there anything else?\n\nWill Larson (00:25:26):\nIf people want to get good at strategy, there's a lot of different types of strategy, but here are some things I'd really recommend. First, I think the Richard Rumelt book, I think Good Strategy, Bad Strategy is probably the right starting point. I think The Crux also quite good, but maybe I would read that one second. Great overview of how to think about strategy. Also Thinking in Systems, I mentioned that before related to systems thinking, a big part of strategy is being able to model the reality so we can improve your diagnosis.\n\n(00:25:56):\nSo I think that one is really quite good as well. If you get into the engineering side of things, there's a lot of interesting books here. There's Technology Strategy Patterns by Evan Hewitt. There's The Value Flywheel effect by Anderson, McCann and O'Reilly. The Phoenix Project by Kim, Behr, Spafford, which is a modern rewrite of The Goal by Goldratt. But I think there's still the missing canonical book is kind of missing on this one. So I took a stab at strategy and my upcoming book, which is coming out the Engineering Executives Primer coming out early next year.\n\n(00:26:33):\nAlso, took a stab at it. In staff engineer my previous book, but I still think there's a missing book here. So I am dreaming of writing an engineering strategy book for my next project, although we'll see if that actually comes together.\n\nLenny (00:26:48):\nWell, let's actually follow that thread of writing something I was definitely hoping to chat about. You write a lot. You've written two, three, four-ish. You're writing a new book. How many books you've published? Two books and there's a third one coming up.\n\nWill Larson (00:27:00):\nSo I have two books. First one with Stripe Press, the second one, self-published and the third one with the Riley coming out in two months effectively.\n\nLenny (00:27:08):\nOkay. And then also many, many blog posts for many, many years. I asked a few people what to ask you, and this came up a lot, Gergely Orosz and Alex Xu from ‎ByteByteGo both asked just this question of just, \"How do you make time to write as much as you do?\" And then I also, I'll ask this too and just answer it either first or second, just what impact has writing had on your career? Why do you keep doing it?\n\nWill Larson (00:27:37):\nI feel really strongly that you can write a lot more if you write what you want to write. And so this is one of the reasons I don't write for financial gain and I don't write very much on a schedule, so I've done a few pieces for magazines, et cetera, but I find that actually really draining to be you have a topic, you have to agree on the topic. If a topic starts missing what you want to write about, you can't fix it a lot of the time and you're also on this deadline. You're like, \"Ah, I'm screwing up. I need to ship this. It needs to be done tomorrow.\"\n\n(00:28:12):\nI just find that really draining. Conversely, when I own the schedule, when I get to write about, \"Hey, I'm writing out something.\" So I started writing this infrastructure engineering book a couple of years ago. It just wasn't there. I just couldn't get it to come together and so I just stopped. I'm not writing it anymore. Maybe I'll come back to it at some point, but probably not.\n\n(00:28:34):\nTo me, the biggest strength of writing what you want is you get to write where there's energy and you don't have to write where there's no energy, which takes you really, really negative. And this also ties into how I write books, which is that I basically write the entire thing before I start working with a publisher. And if you are, I think diligent and good at anticipating what their concerns are going to be, you can mostly reuse the content that you're trying to write. This is also easier in the sorts of books I write.\n\n(00:29:05):\nI think harder to do in a really technical introduction to MySQL or something, you can't just resequence those chapters and pretend it's going to work. Those chapters build in a different way than the sort of business book that I write does. Writing the stuff that's energizing and just giving up on the stuff that's not energizing, that's how I write a lot and how I've been writing for 16 some years. And the way I keep doing it is just by writing what's energizing and what I'm thinking about now.\n\n(00:29:38):\nI don't write what I'm not thinking about and I don't write for any audience, I just write what is interesting to me. And that means some people don't like it and that's great. That's totally fine. It's not really for them, it's for people who want to follow the ride and that's where I focus.\n\nLenny (00:29:57):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

There's a lot more I want to dig into here. How many posts have you written do you think over the 16 years?\n\nWill Larson (00:31:00):\nI would guess about a thousand. That would roughly be my assumption. I think there are a few years where I wrote hundreds of posts, and so if you do that like three years, it's not that hard to get to a thousand from there.\n\nLenny (00:31:16):\nThat's incredible, especially because you've had intense jobs for all of those years or most of those years. Very high pressure, fast growing hypergrowth companies. Somehow you find time to work. So first, let me just double click slash co-sign your advice here around paying attention to what gives you energy and working on things that you're actually curious about. This is exactly the advice I give to people. A lot of people start this full-time writer, creator life, and they're like, \"What do people want? What do people want me to write about? What's popular? What's going to inspire go viral?\"\n\n(00:31:48):\nAnd that's easy to do a couple times, but then you end up creating this job for yourself that you don't want. You don't want to be spending all your days writing about AI if you're not that excited by AI or whatever's hot these days. What I find is important is almost like 80, 90% of what you write has to be stuff you're excited about. And then maybe there's a bit of, \"Here's what I know people really want. Here's what I know is going to do really well.\" Because otherwise you just burn out. You create a job for yourself that you don't want. Why would you do that?\n\nWill Larson (00:32:13):\nYeah. I just a hundred percent agree with that. I think the other thing is that everyone converges on the same thing that they think people want. So it's crypto two years ago. It's like AI right now or it's counter AI. AI is going to ruin the world. It's hard to say something very novel because, one, everyone is trying to say something about it. Two, it's almost certainly not what you're that knowledgeable about where if you just stick in your lane, I think the biggest risk to writers is quitting.\n\n(00:32:43):\nA little bit like the 40-year career idea. The biggest risk to content creation of any sort is quitting soon because you get burned out. The biggest risk is not that you grow too slow initially. There's always this sense that you've missed the wave. It's too late to join Substack. The top writers are already there. You'll never be a top writer. It's too late to podcast. There's too many podcasts. You'll never make it. It's too late to join Medium. You'll never make it. There's too many Medium writers.\n\n(00:33:11):\nBut it is just not true. If you just keep writing good stuff, you'll build an audience over time and you can take that audience from platform to platform. What really matters is finding something you can actually keep doing for the next decade. That's way harder than doing it for one year.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nWe have the same exact advice on this. This is exactly the things I tell everyone. When I joined Substack, I thought it was too late. I was like, \"Man, it's over.\" And when I started this podcast like, \"Oh man, there's a billion podcasts. How is it ever going to work?\" So I so agree, and I also so agree on the fact that this whole thing is such a... It's a long game. There's a lot of people. I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it up. Nobody actually keeps it up because people are going to come and go. The thing that really separates success from failure is just people that can keep at it. There's not an end game to this. It's an infinite game and it's about being able to sustain that over the long term.\n\nWill Larson (00:34:04):\nYou're not competing with other content creators. If you think of it as an infinite game, you're all working together. You can all help each other grow. There's no maximum number of product writers or thinkers who can be doing something. You're not less successful because [inaudible 00:34:22] exists or something like that. There's no competition there. It's like a false, false dichotomy.\n\nLenny (00:34:27):\nYeah. I totally agree with that. Unless there's so many and then all of a sudden what happens is the bar just gets higher, which is good because then people get better stuff and that's fine. That's happening anyway. Just the bar continues to increase because there's more and more content out there. And to me that's the ultimate thing you got to get right is just the bar. You just got to be at a high bar for anyone to care about anything you're writing about. And to your point, to do that well, you have to actually be excited about writing about it and have background and have something to contribute.\n\n(00:34:59):\nI'm just ranting here, but the way I think about this is you need to add something new to the conversation for anyone to pay attention because there's so much fluffy, superficial stuff. And to get anyone to care is you need to say something new that no one's heard before or share new information they haven't seen anywhere else.\n\nWill Larson (00:35:15):\nI totally agree. I could keep ranting about this for the entire time. I don't want to derail on this, but I totally agree.\n\nLenny (00:35:23):\nWe'll control ourselves. So then getting very tactical, I think this is what a lot of people are always wondering, how do you make time? What's your workflow? How do you make time for writing so that you keep at it with knowing you have an intense full-time job?\n\nWill Larson (00:35:34):\nI used to do things differently before I had a kid, so I have a three and a half year old and just timing your life just really shifts a lot once you have kids. But the biggest thing that I found is finding things to write about that also directly relate to what I'm working on. And this is where I can do something that helps me at work and helps me write at the same time because I think it's incredibly hard to find time to write about stuff that has nothing to do with your work.\n\n(00:36:05):\nAnd this distracts you from your work because these... Particularly if you're in a senior role, these can be pretty demanding jobs, but they're not demanding because you're responding to an urgent DM on Slack every five or six minutes. They're demanding because you need to make some really difficult decisions really well. And I think writing about related topics is a great way to refine your thinking and improve your performance. It's not like a conflict or you do one.\n\n(00:36:34):\nYou either write or you do your job well. I think you can find a way to align. And so a lot of podcast folks do interviews with folks who are related to what they're thinking about at work, and that's a great way for them to learn, build their network, to refine their thinking, to test their thinking against experts in the field. It's not like in conflict with the work, it's in alignment. So that's one piece. But yeah, I've played around with my schedule a lot.\n\n(00:36:58):\nBefore I had a kid, often Saturdays would be the writing day and so morning and early afternoon would just be writing. I can't do that anymore, so now I mostly write at night, which is tricky from an energy management perspective. But the biggest thing I would say is just if you're actually excited about something, you will find time and energy for it. If you're not excited about it and it's 9:00 PM, you're just going to get asleep. And so I really think that this is where you have to schedule a little bit deliberately, but the first thing we talked about around energy management, they really come together. When your schedule gets tight, if you're not energized, you just won't get it done. And why would you? It just doesn't make sense.\n\nLenny (00:37:41):\nJust to close out this thread for someone that wants to do more writing knows that it's going to be valuable, but just hasn't any one tip that you would leave them with to get on this train?\n\nWill Larson (00:37:51):\nIt depends why people want to write. I tell people, if you just want to write something that is going to help advance your career, you should really focus on writing two or three really good things and spend a ton of time drafting, revising, getting feedback. You just focus on making one great artifact or two or three great artifacts. You don't need to create a long-running blog where you publish every week. There's really no need to do that if your goal is just to create some artifacts that show you're a deep thinker, that help position you in the industry.\n\n(00:38:21):\nDon't start a newsletter if you just want to advance yourself in the industry a little bit. Just write two or three really good things. So that's the first thing I'd say. But if your goal is to write a lot consistently over time, my biggest advice would be just publish. And so there's a lot of people out there with stuff that hundreds of drafts and they've not published anything. And my thing is I publish almost everything I write. If there's something that I'm not going to publish, I don't start writing it because I have a quick check in my head like is this something I can write and publish?\n\n(00:38:56):\nAnd if my answer was like, \"No, I just don't even start.\" And my accuracy has gotten higher over time as I've written more, but I published pretty much everything I write. That's why some of it is not that good. And that's okay. Again, I want to write. I want to get these ideas out. I want to show what I'm focused on and my evolution as a thinker trying to learn how to operate in these different roles in these different companies. I'm not writing trying to create a polished perfect thing, and also I'm not writing to maximize a reader's experience of reading it.\n\n(00:39:27):\nSome people don't like that, and I think that's a totally reasonable thing not to, but I think what I can bring you is my experience as an operator who's actively learning and thinking through. I think that's really valuable to other operators in the industry. In terms of giving you the perfect writing, I try to do that, closer to that. I don't know if I ever hit perfect writing, but that's where my books are. The books are taking a collection of thoughts over a couple of years, cleaning them up a little bit, packaging them. They're way higher quality than my typical writing.\n\n(00:39:56):\nBut yeah, I would just publish a lot. Don't worry about the quality. Sometimes people will send you silly feedback and I just don't respond to that stuff anymore. You never know why people send you something like that. I think trying to debug people you don't know is a bad use of time. It's just kind of like, \"Thank you. Move on to the next. Don't even spend time worrying about it.\"\n\nLenny (00:40:19):\nI like that term debug people. I think people way overestimate how much anyone cares about what you put out. Most people are going to look at it for three seconds and be like, \"Eh.\" That's the worst case scenario basically is just like, \"I don't care about this.\" Not like, \"Oh, Will is such a fool.\" What a dumb thing to say. Right? No one has time for that.\n\nWill Larson (00:40:38):\nAnd if they do, that's a them problem, right? The internet is a big place with a lot of people and there are people who are going to be having a really bad day when they encounter something you do and they're going to channel that anger at you or that frustration at you, but that's not about you. That's just like you happen to be there when they engage with it. You don't have to take that on. That's not your situation. It's okay.\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\nAlso, when you're just starting out, that's going to be the least stressful time to write because nobody knows it or sees it, so that's when it's like \"Take all the crazy... Just do stuff.\" It only gets more stressful as you build an audience over time.\n\nWill Larson (00:41:15):\nYeah, absolutely. Absolutely true.\n\nLenny (00:41:18):\nOkay. Shifting topics. There's a lot of product managers that listen to this. Something PMs often wonder is how to have better relationships with their engineers, their eng managers. What advice could you give to product managers to build more productive happy relationships with their engineers and eng managers?\n\nWill Larson (00:41:37):\nSo the core problem, and most of the EM PM peers that I've worked on... There's two core problems. So one, sometimes the incentives are misaligned and that's hard to navigate, but if you can just be honest with each other and understand the incentives, sometimes you can find a compromise, but sometimes the EMs and PMs will be misaligned because just their incentives are so far apart that there's no way to get to the bottom of it. And so this might be timeline related or saying yes to sales related. Or the engineer is like, \"Hey, we definitely can't say yes to that.\" And the PMs are like, \"Actually, we're going to say yes to it because really important for me getting promoted,\" or something like that.\n\n(00:42:19):\nIs it ever this simple? It's really never that simple. People create simplistic narratives to find villains that they work with. There are no villains in the workplace. They're just people with complex incentives that are doing complex things. But sometimes I talk to EMs who think, \"Oh, the product manager is just saying yes because they want to get promoted because the salesperson will review their promotion or something.\"\n\n(00:42:40):\nThe reality is never as simple. The reality is the business needs to sell stuff to remain functioning. You can't just say no and have the business succeed. That doesn't work either. So one, understanding the incentives. The other piece though, and I think this is the more common case or just that the EM or the PM just don't understand the other person's needs and they start arguing before understanding. So my biggest advice to both the EMs and the PMs, is before you try to solve the conflict, it's like pushing to ship this feature, pushing to change the approach. Just make sure you actually understand what they care about.\n\n(00:43:17):\nThere is this idea that you have to make trade-offs and that there are tons of hard trade-offs to be made in the field, but my experience is if you really deeply understand what everyone wants, there's usually a compromised solution that gives everyone exactly what they want. That doesn't take more time. You just have to be willing to dig deeper into it and understand the true needs for each party, which is often not what they're saying by the way, which is part of the confusion.\n\nLenny (00:43:45):\nOn the incentives piece, is there anything you've seen work to fix that problem? Because if PM performance reviews are based on impact engineering, performance reviews are based on interesting projects or uptime, do you just work to change those ladder definitions? What actually can help that situation?\n\nWill Larson (00:44:05):\nSo my biggest thing has been trying to force this idea that EM/PM pairs are peers and they generally have the same performance rating. And there's exceptions here. It could be the EM is clearly not performing and then it's not the PM's fault if the EM is can't show up to work. The team doesn't respect them. Sometimes there's clear non-performance, but generally hard situations are not situations where one person is obviously terrible. Those are easy to diagnose, those are the easy ones. But in cases where there's two folks who seem to be pretty good, but just the overall execution is not working out, I think this idea that same perf rating for both drives a level of one pain, but the right perspective.\n\n(00:44:56):\nAlso, something that I think Carta has experimented a little bit with over time. Henry, our CEO has a blog post about trifectas in doing that, but not just for EM and for PM, but also for that business leadership as well where you all get graded the same score based on your ability to evaluate and solve for the entire set of constraints, not just your functional constraints.\n\nLenny (00:45:20):\nWow. That's so interesting. So your recommendation, something you're doing, it sounds like is the engineer manager and the PM get the same performance review rating? And so they're discussed in the same meeting.\n\nWill Larson (00:45:33):\nOur chief product officer, Vrushali and I spend a fair amount of time calibrating together and making sure... Again, there's cases where there's an exception because there's clear issues happening for someone. But on average that is what's happening. And I think people know that's what's happening because we told them that. And I think that's pretty powerful.\n\nLenny (00:45:55):\nThat is so interesting. I've never heard of that approach. That is definitely solving that problem of EM/PM or...\n\nWill Larson (00:46:01):\nYeah, the incentives are shared now, which isn't perfect. It's still hard to balance them. They can still make the wrong trade-offs, but at least they understand the incentives are shared, which I think is a pretty powerful idea.\n\nLenny (00:46:15):\nThat is really interesting. I imagine some companies might even want to include design managers in that, take another step.\n\nWill Larson (00:46:23):\nThe role and the primacy of different functions in different companies varies so much that it's hard to have a one size. You could also imagine where you want a staff engineer in that or not. And so I think very company specific. But yeah, I think design could absolutely be involved particularly for a design led company like an Airbnb or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:46:43):\nWow. So interesting. Maybe just as a final thought there, if a PM is having challenges with their EM, what do you think PMs maybe don't realize their engineering managers are finding important or maybe are stressed about that they're just like, \"Oh wow, I never thought about that.\"\n\nWill Larson (00:47:00):\nI think one of the biggest challenges I've historically seen, particularly in the last decade is this idea that engineering managers have the job of giving their team interesting work. I think that that can put... You often see this in growth teams where the growth team is like, \"Hey, we just need to do a ton of experiments.\" An engineer is like, \"I want to build something brand new.\" And the eng managers in between those try to figure out, \"Need to ship 50 experiments that are pretty boring and they want to do something brand new. I don't know how to do solve this.\"\n\n(00:47:30):\nSo it's a tricky moment. And good EMs find the way to balance, but that's the biggest source of ongoing friction where the EMs have been told by their teams they need to do something that the PMs just have no visibility into. And it makes the EM seem totally unreliable partners because they're trying to solve these little bit of these invisible constraints. And that's where I think pushing further to understand, \"Hey, you keep prioritizing this rewrite into a new programming language.\"\n\n(00:48:00):\nTo me that seems like completely idiotic thing to be doing. What's going on? And then once you understand, you might not agree with them, but at least you can have an honest conversation about how to navigate those constraints versus just like, \"Man, you won't believe what my EM partner did today. This bozo did blah, blah, blah.\" And having this victim villain mindset about your peers.\n\nLenny (00:48:24):\nAn adjacent topic that I wanted to spend some time on is measuring engineering velocity productivity. I think it's probably one of the most common and also maybe the most annoying questions eng leaders get is just how do I know if my engineers are moving as quickly as they can? How do we help them move faster? What advice do you give to eng leaders for eng teams just for how to measure productivity well?\n\nWill Larson (00:48:44):\nThis is a question that's coming up even more in a moment when we're reducing a lot of the size of teams from the industry when the venture capitalists that are on the board for these venture-backed companies are pushing on the efficiency of engineering. Engineers are trying to figure out how do we represent this? How do we prove that we're appropriately productive for the amount of headcount and funding that we have as an organization?\n\n(00:49:09):\nAnd man, that's hard. So the first way that people focus on trying to answer these questions is just benchmarking by the amount of funding that you have. And that's pretty straightforward to do is a mechanical exercise. You get a data set from your venture capital funds or whatnot, and you figure out, \"Okay. How much should we be spending in R&D? How much should we be spending in engineering? How much should we be sending on infrastructure engineering in R&D?\" And you can benchmark this all out and figure out what the correct numbers are there.\n\n(00:49:40):\nThe problem is this is a very mechanical and not very insightful, driven way. It'll get you a defensible answer. It's like the old, no one gets fired for buying IBM, which definitely hasn't been true in my career ever. But this idea that if you just have the right benchmarks, DCs won't judge you for spending too much in engineering, but this doesn't actually help you get to the right place. It just helps you get your board to be less angry at you, which is useful because it's hard to do good work when your board is angry at you.\n\n(00:50:13):\nBut it's not useful in the sense that it doesn't actually help you run your organization effectively. So then there's the much harder mediator problem of how do you actually know if your R&D team or engineering team is effective? What I find is a couple of things. First, if you're a good leader and you talk to engineers, they will tell you... The engineers know if their teams are effective or not. And if they're not, they'll also tell you why not. And their diagnosis can be wrong, but there's a crumb you can start picking up and you can trace the crumbs to figure out what's wrong.\n\n(00:50:49):\nOften you'll have more experience to analyze the complaints to figure out what kind of the contributing causes are to them. But yeah, if you just go talk to the team on an ongoing basis, you'll know if they're effective or not and you can go work to solve those specific problems. But again, you can't tell your board, \"Oh, it's fine. I talked to the teams that they're good.\" My intuition's spot on because how do they know if your intuition is good or not?\n\n(00:51:17):\nThey're dealing with a huge portfolio and some of their leaders are talking to are good, and some of them have terrible intuition. How do they actually assess? I think it's tricky. What I've tried to do is basically two things. One, aligning engineering evaluation to the business and product goals. So I want us to be wholly accountable with the product goals. Well, we did a good job products like screwing up over there. Obviously, a lot of companies find comfort in doing that, but really we're here to support the product, to support our customers in doing something interesting. We're not here to build novel systems unless it supports the customer and the product.\n\n(00:51:59):\nSo first try to align heavily there. Second, I think just showing the roadmap of the valuable things we've done in the last six months is really powerful. I think sometimes people are like, \"I don't have anything to put there.\" And you're like, \"Yeah, that's a real issue.\" Or if you have the ton of stuff to put there, that's great. I really find that if you just commit, show the number of meaningful, meaty things that have impact that you're doing and you can explain the impact, people will step back and give you space. If you can't populate that list, people will have concerns and rightly so, they should be concerned about that.\n\nLenny (00:52:36):\nIs there any metrics or tools or anything like that that you find useful too? Because these are all awesome piece of advice, but I imagine everyone is always just like, \"Give us this number we're tracking, give us this dashboard, see what engineers doing.\"\n\nWill Larson (00:52:49):\nSo one of the most influential books in the last decade in software engineering leadership and infrastructure is Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and I believe there's a third author on that one, but I'm forgetting right now. Really phenomenal book and it comes up with these four metrics. It comes up with lead time. It comes up with incident remediation time. It comes up with failure rate. And the fourth one of some sort. There's at least 50 different startups out there that are selling you dashboards that instrument these pieces of data and they want you to just evaluate your team on them.\n\n(00:53:30):\nThe challenge is these are really good diagnosis metrics. And so hey, our deployments are slow. Why is that? How do we speed them up? But your deployments being slow doesn't make you a good company or a bad company, it just tells you where you should focus on improving. It doesn't actually change how you are. And similarly, if your lead time is quick or slow, it tells you where you should invest or it doesn't actually tell you if you should fire your engineers or something like that. That's way, way more details specific.\n\n(00:54:00):\nSo people do like to see these metrics just like they see uptime metrics. A lot of engineers report on sprint points or stuff like that to their board, which are just totally, totally fake thing to be reporting on. But people get some comfort on it. So my biggest thing here is when people measure things, this isn't an engineering only problem, but when people measure, they take on the perspective of an expert and they can tell you why not to measure everything. They can tell you why every measure is wrong or inaccurate and they rule everything out and so they measure nothing and they go to someone who's not an expert and well actually there's no accurate measure to give.\n\n(00:54:37):\nThey're not an expert is like you don't know what you're doing. And so you just have to get comfortable measuring something that's not perfect, but you can actually measure and reporting on it and then the measure that's imperfect as people ask questions, that's an opportunity to educate people on why the measure is imperfect. What are some things that misses or kind of the lies from the conversation.\n\n(00:54:59):\nMetrics are about educating the people consuming the metrics about the reality of the rich data underneath. They're not about this perfect data set that shows everything starting with something mediocre and the Dora metrics are really helpful for diagnosis, but if you have to, they can also be a good enough starting place to start reporting to your board or your CEO or to the other executives and then you're like, \"Oh, there's all these problems with them.\"\n\n(00:55:22):\nYes. There are all those problems with them, but that's this place you start and you educate people up from there to help them understand the nuances and that's how they become more sophisticated, understanding engineering, not by refusing to give them anything they can possibly measure.\n\nLenny (00:55:36):\nAwesome. I'm glad that was your answer because we had Nicole on the podcast and she talked through Dora and all the frameworks that she recommends. And she even actually shared some benchmarks that she points people to that give you some sense of just like, \"Are you in a good place roughly or not?\" So we'll point people to that episode to dig deeper. Awesome. I'm glad that you're a fan.\n\n(00:55:55):\nOkay. Just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. One is around values, company values, org values. Do you have some really good advice for people for how to think about coming up with values? What do you share? What do you recommend to people that are trying to figure out what values they should define for their org and their company?\n\nWill Larson (00:56:14):\nI mean, values are really interesting, right? And different companies talk about values in different ways. I once worked at a company where the execs went to visit the Facebook campus. They saw the values written up on the wall and they took the Facebook values and wrote them up in our walls and that didn't do a whole lot. It maybe undermined people's confidence in the critical thinking of the executive team that just took these written up on Facebook walls and replicated it.\n\n(00:56:39):\nBut I think those values did work well for Facebook and those values were meaningful for Facebook. And so first you can't do is just steal values. Value cargo culting. Users first. Great Amazon value. A lot of companies aren't users first and that's okay, but what's not okay is when you put, \"Hey, we're users first,\" and then you actually show the decisions you're making and you clearly aren't users first.\n\n(00:57:06):\nSo one of the things I think about is just honesty. And so good values have to be honest and so any value can be honest or there's no universally honest values. You can say something like, \"We're thrifty.\" Or we can say something like we spend as much as we need to get the best value. Those are totally different and good companies are run both ways. So the first rule I think about a lot is honesty. You actually do what you claim you do and the value. The second one is applicability. You have to have value that you can actually figure out how to apply to your work.\n\n(00:57:39):\nAnd so one of Stripe's values was no longer a value I believe, but it's optimized globally. And so optimized globally is a really interesting problem because sometimes you'll have something you wanted for interesting value. Sometimes you want to do something and you're like, \"Hey, I want to introduce a new programming language that's better for my team.\" For the organization overall, this is actually much worse for the organization so I'm not going to do it.\n\n(00:58:03):\nUber didn't have this as a written value, but implicitly Uber's value was do what's good for your team and ignore everyone else because that will slow us down. So the two different companies had opposite values, but they're both very applicable. It's like how should we navigate decisions? Should I optimize for my team or for the organization? So those are applicable to real problems and they were honest where Uber was just like, \"Don't worry about other people.\" Make it work for your team. And that's how they moved so fast because they just didn't worry.\n\nLenny (00:58:32):\nWasn't their value of toe-stepping, encouraging toe-stepping, something like that?\n\nWill Larson (00:58:36):\nLet builders build toe stepping. There were a number of values that could be interpreted in different ways and sometimes they got weaponized in various ways as all values do. But these are both interesting in different ways. And so number one is honest and two is applicable. Three is I think the last thing for a good value is this idea of reversibility. So there's some values that aren't actually usable. And so here's a good example. We build good software. Okay. But why would you ever not build good software? That doesn't make sense or we solve customer problems that matter. Good.\n\n(00:59:22):\nWhat company doesn't think they're solving customer problems that matter? And so there's certain values that just you can't apply. And so I think of these as identity values. These are really just you describing who you want to be or we care about our customers. Great. But who would say they don't care about that? There's certain values that I think of as just identity values and they're not wrong to have identity values, they just aren't very useful.\n\n(00:59:51):\nYou can't actually use them for anything. And so I just always push people not to spend too much time on these because they feel good when you're an executive team debating what are these identity values? It's like we're kind to other people or sure that sounds good. We're a family. Sure, that sounds good. That one I guess is a little bit reversible. There's Netflix, which is like, \"We're a team like a sports team. We're not a family.\" And so a little bit reversible, but not perfectly.\n\n(01:00:20):\nBut yeah, these are the three that I found really useful for any value. Is it honest? Is it applicable? And can you reverse it? And if not, it's probably actually not helping the team make decisions.\n\nLenny (01:00:30):\nThese are great. It reminds me a lot of... I was there during Airbnb's period of coming up with values. Something that I would maybe add and maybe fits into one of these buckets is it needs to be clear who doesn't? There needs to be a group that doesn't quite fit because if everyone fits, you're not doing anything useful. What's the point? Which feels weird to say, why would not everyone fit in our big group of awesome company? But it's clear who is not a good fit, who doesn't belong basically. It's kind of like a cult a little bit like, \"Who's not in our cult? Who doesn't belong?\"\n\nWill Larson (01:00:59):\nBut I agree. If it doesn't apply to anyone, then why bother saying it? It doesn't mean anything. And you could say it's actually the hiring filter where there are people who you've explicitly chosen not to hire because this wouldn't apply to them. Then I think it's useful because it helps you actually figure out who to bring in. But if it doesn't apply to anyone you're hiring or anyone that you have in the company, then it's just isn't worth having because you already have too many values. You are already trying to get rid of values because you have 17 and you need to get down to four where people can remember them. So if it doesn't apply to anyone, why bother having it at all?\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\nYeah. Integrity is a common one. Integrity. Everyone has that. Nobody wouldn't want integrity. What is unique?\n\nWill Larson (01:01:38):\nWe're a non-integrity company. We're the company that thinks integrity is bad. That's not a real thing.\n\nLenny (01:01:45):\nThe other one I'll add to is honest. So Airbnb, we had six values initially. One of them was simplify and a year or two later everyone just realized we're not actually good at this. We want to simplify, but we're not great at this skill and values should describe who you are not who you want to be and aspire to be. So they cut two values including that one, and they're just like, \"Let's just do these four because this is actually who we are. Let's be honest with ourselves.\"\n\n(01:02:11):\nOkay, final question. I wanted to visit Failure Corner, something that I've added recently to this podcast where people share a story of failure. And you have this amazing post about your experience with Digg and the rewrite that you all went through. I think it was the version four of Digg. Can you just tell that story and what happened? How much of a mess it ended up being?\n\nWill Larson (01:02:33):\nYeah, Dig V4 is... I mean, it's still something I have a lot of fond memories for. There's one picture that I've kept and there's a picture of a lot of the engineers around this table in the middle of this giant office and they're serving sushi. We had waiters, caterers come in that day. They're serving sushi. They have plates with champagne flutes on it. There was a full bar and we're all around this table because the site is not up.\n\n(01:03:03):\nAnd so Digg before essentially what Kevin Rose or the board or some combination there realized is that Digg was losing to the social networks and that this idea of aggregated news was going to be outcompeted by the Twitters, the Facebooks, et cetera, if we didn't find a way to move to have a social component for it. It even outcompeted by Reddit longterm was kind of the fear. Although at the time that that was far from obvious. And so we needed to move to support social functionality and the previous version we simply couldn't get it to work.\n\n(01:03:39):\nSo the decision that was done, I think two and a half years before I joined, and the shift about six months after I joined was they needed to do a complete rewrite in order to get there. This is a decision that never works out for anyone. So I think as someone with more experience, I could have predicted this wasn't going to work out. But I was earlier in my career. My PM counterpart at Yahoo, Das Kofinovsky. He went to Yahoo and he's like, \"Come to Digg.\"\n\n(01:04:10):\nWorst case you'll make a couple hundred thousand in a year. Worst case. Probably really great outcome. Anyway, that's not what happened. The worst case was a little bit optimistic. So we go and the CEO got fired two days before I joined. So the current CEO left and then Kevin Rose came back for about six months, something like that. And we're just on the death march trying to get this thing out.\n\n(01:04:37):\nSo we pushed really hard. This was before the cloud for the most part. So we wiped pretty much all of our existing servers to re-image them to the new software. We try to bring the site up and just keeps crashing. And so it basically takes us a month to get it fully functional again. And so that day sitting around that table with champagne and sushi, that's just like day one. And by 30 days in, most people aren't even trying to get the site back up anymore.\n\n(01:05:08):\nThere's maybe five of us who are still trying. And we did. I think that was a really powerful moment for me. I think in the first two days myself and Rich Schumacher, one of the other engineers, we had to write a caching system from scratch, which got us half the way up. Really a terrible way to do software on a side note. I'm not recommending this to anyone. This was a series of anti-patterns kludged into a launch. But we got it partially up, but we had to restart it every 12 months.\n\n(01:05:41):\nEvery 12 hours, every server had to be restarted even with the caching mechanism. And then about three weeks after that, I finally figured out what the core bug was, that was bringing us down every 12 hours. It was this incredibly simple issue that had just been hard to debug, basically related to the way that Python initiates variables used as default parameters. It's something super silly and we just had someone who hadn't written Python before who was working on the API code, so they didn't realize it's gotcha.\n\n(01:06:15):\nThen no one else caught it when it was reviewed and it just took a long time to debug. It was such a non-obvious. It didn't break anything, it was just doing a lot of extra load on the servers. We finally figured it out and it was just really remarkable experience pulling through. And you know what? The company still went to zero. So we had this at launch. I think we did this heroic, heroic stretch to get it working.\n\n(01:06:43):\nA couple weeks after that, a new CEO came in, did a round of layoffs. This is back I think 2012. The team nine months after I started was down to 30 people from about a hundred and it went downhill from there, from a business perspective. But we launched a lot of functionality, has really learned just a tremendous amount. And it kind of shaped what I think about in terms of early in your career, getting learning and going into a company that is maybe having a rough time.\n\n(01:07:15):\nI became a manager two and a half years into my career. Basically running the entire engineering team there because everyone who had a lick of sense quit or got laid off, and it was just complete idiot me trying to be the manager for the engineering org, wasn't qualified and no one would've given me that job, but I was the only one dumb enough to take it at that point. I learned so much and I really the kernel that turned into my entire career where it was that opportunity, even though at the time it was pretty grim.\n\nLenny (01:07:49):\nThat's an amazing story. I feel like a lot of these experiences were in the moment, it's just like, \"What is going on? This is so bad and hard,\" end up being the most interesting and looking back end up being the most biggest teaching experiences. The ones you like bond over with people you work with like Apple. It always comes to mind where it's just like Steve Jobs's joke, people like crazy and then they look back and that was the best moment in my career.\n\nWill Larson (01:08:12):\nYou would never voluntarily take on a lot of these really challenging things, but sometimes when they show up, you're with a group of people you really respect, you love working with and you want to overcome together. And that's really powerful experience. Even if Uber China was similar where if someone had been like, \"Hey, do you want to go work on this Uber China migration?\" I would've been like, \"Absolutely not.\" But no one asked. They're just like, \"Get this done,\" and so we did. I think these things are pretty remarkable.\n\nLenny (01:08:39):\nAnd just to be clear, so Digg was down for a month basically during this period? Is that...\n\nWill Larson (01:08:43):\nSo it basically didn't work properly for much of the month. It was like read only was back up in about three days, but the vast majority of the actual user functionality just wasn't working properly for pretty much an entire month and it was not that good. I mean not great, but that wasn't the biggest problem Digg had at that point. But it was one of the biggest problems that had at that point and it wasn't a real sign of things likely to go well for us. But like I said, you learn from those and I'm really proud that we and the team got it working, got it running even if ultimately we still went to zero and ran out of money and kind of sold for parts.\n\nLenny (01:09:32):\nDo you think Digg could have made it? There was a world where Digg would've been a hugely successful business or do you think it was just way too late and it's the wrong product?\n\nWill Larson (01:09:39):\nThe thing that really killed Digg is the change. It wasn't SEO driven. So monetization was from ads. Well, many companies including Digg claimed that it was the first in kind of stream, in feed like advertising company where Twitter has ads within the tweets or Facebook does. But Digg did that before Facebook or Twitter really innovated the ad format. But the vast majority of monetization was on these... We call them permalink pages, which is page 40. Then article we crawled and the vast majority of traffic for that was driven by Google search. And so there was an SEO change, which really is the thing that started creating the urgency for us to launch this migration.\n\n(01:10:20):\nSEO changed, traffic started going down, monetization was driven by that. And so we were already on fire by the time we tried to launch this. But I do think that I still want something like what Digg was trying to become today. Social news based on like what my friends are actually reading and liking merged with a global index of similar users who are interested in similar topics. It's still a product that I think Google Reader has some kind of similar components to it.\n\n(01:10:49):\nThese are both interesting products solving interesting problems that have not for whatever reason been successful as businesses. And I do think there's a gap there still, but there's a lot of people trying unsuccessfully to fill it and there must be a reason why people struggle to fill it despite so many people trying.\n\nLenny (01:11:06):\nAwesome. Will, is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very fast lightning round because I know you have to run in about five minutes?\n\nWill Larson (01:11:16):\nI think we've covered a lot of it. New book coming out. New book coming out in February, Engineering Executive's Primer, O'Reilly. But that's probably it.\n\nLenny (01:11:25):\nAwesome. Where do people find that? I know it's on O'Reilly. You can look at a preview of it even today, right?\n\nWill Larson (01:11:29):\nYeah. O'Reilly, you can see the early copy. You can order it on Amazon as well, but it won't be shipping until February.\n\nLenny (01:11:37):\nOkay. And then just to be clear, who's this for? It's for engineering executives by the sound of it.\n\nWill Larson (01:11:42):\nIt's for engineering executives, but more so like anyone who wants to be one, anyone who's trying to figure out how to work with an engineering executive. So I think if you are struggling to understand why your CTO keeps doing boneheaded things, or if you want to side manage them, you're the head of product and you can't get the CTO to stop complaining about the engineers need more interesting projects to work on, this might be useful for you too.\n\nLenny (01:12:04):\nAmazing. Okay. Ready for the lightning round?\n\nWill Larson (01:12:07):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (01:12:08):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nWill Larson (01:12:11):\nSo I talked about Thinking in Systems and Primer. I talked about Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, but I'll give you a third one, which is Don't Think of an Elephant by George Lakoff. It's a really interesting book about framing things in conversations that has really changed how I communicate.\n\nLenny (01:12:24):\nAmazing. Favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nWill Larson (01:12:28):\nI don't watch much TV or many movies anymore, but something I do still watch is Top Chef with my wife. She's a Top Chef, super fan. And there's something just very relaxing from these formulaic structured shows where you kind of know what's going to happen. There's no real consequences that matter too much and just escaping from real life to these formulas can be pretty peaceful.\n\nLenny (01:12:50):\nNo one has ever mentioned Top Chef before, so that's fun. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing for a job?\n\nWill Larson (01:12:58):\nA lot of my interviews now are trying to help people decide if they actually want to join a company. And so my favorite question I ask now is like, \"Hey, we've really loved you. You're going to come through. I think you're going to get a lot of offers from other companies too. I bet you'll have three or four really compelling offers because you're a fantastic candidate. How are you going to figure out really specifically which of those options are right for you?\"\n\n(01:13:22):\nI think it forces people to tell you what they want and then you tell them why you have that more than anyone else, and then you can actually pitch them on what matters versus pitching on things that don't.\n\nLenny (01:13:31):\nLove that. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, find useful either in work or in life?\n\nWill Larson (01:13:40):\nNo mottos, but I can think of two things I thought about a lot. At Uber is something I talk to people a lot because it was a challenging time for much of it. It was there's no way around, just through.And that was like, \"Hey, we're not going to dodge around this. We're going to gut through it and we're going to get to the other side and then we're going to be there.\" What I think about a lot more now is, will anyone remember what we decided in six months? Because I think people stress out about a lot of decisions, but I increasingly believe most decisions people stress out about just aren't that important.\n\n(01:14:11):\nSo I'm like, \"Will anyone care in six months what we did here?\" And the answer is no. Just do something reasonable and let's move on to the next more important thing.\n\nLenny (01:14:17):\nI love that. You've done a lot of writing. Is there a piece that you've written that you feel like is underappreciated that no one really totally got and hasn't spread and you're like, \"Ah, I'm so proud of that one\"?\n\nWill Larson (01:14:30):\nMaybe the piece I'm most proud of from last year was Hard To Work With. So Hard To Work With is basically I see a lot of people who are incredibly talented, but they try to hold their peers to a high standard and then they're viewed as combative or difficult to work with. And this one comes from a core struggle of my early career where I kept trying. I thought I was holding people accountable and people were just like, \"You suck to work with.\"\n\n(01:14:58):\nAnd I was like, \"But I'm just trying to have a high standard. Isn't that what we want?\" And talk about honest values. Every company is like, \"We have high standards,\" and you're like, \"Well, let's do it.\" And then they're like, \"We don't have high standards here. You suck.\" So that one is one that really is so transformational to me, and I think it really hits some people hard because I think a lot of people really go their entire career without figuring this one out.\n\n(01:15:20):\nAnd they're some of the most talented, hardest working people you'll ever work with and can't quite land this one idea that's holding them back. And they care so much and they are often despised because they care so much. I think this is one that I hope more people will read over times and there's a really important lesson for me in there.\n\nLenny (01:15:42):\nWell, we will link to it in the show notes and help more people discover it. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nWill Larson (01:15:51):\nSo find me online, lethain.com, lethain.com. All my writing, my books, everything links linked there. And the biggest thing that I'm thinking about right now is just strategy. So really curious for folks who are thinking about strategy, who think they've done product, business, or engineering strategy well. Would love to hear from folks what they're thinking about, what's actually worked and maybe what are the lies that have not turned out to work that they thought might work earlier in their journey.\n\nLenny (01:16:19):\nAmazing. Will, thank you so much for being here.\n\nWill Larson (01:16:23):\nThank you so much. This is really fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:16:25):\nSame for me. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

实际上，让工程师远离那些重要的事情对他们并没有好处。所以我认为，目前最值得关注的亮点之一是，我们正在回归到一个可以把工程师视为同僚、让他们担任高级领导职务的时刻，而不再基于“噢，我们必须娇惯（coddle）他们或让他们远离真实问题”这种基本假设。这也是他们获得成长机会的方式。\n\nLenny (00:00:35):\n今天，我的嘉宾是 Will

(00:03:42):\n很多人都建议我邀请你来。你有很多粉丝，我也很高兴能深入探讨工程话题，我们在本播客中讨论得还不够多。所以，感谢你抽出时间。\n\nWill Larson (00:03:54):\n不客气。我希望能在你未来可能完全转型为工程播客之前，做一个好的早期工程嘉宾。\n\nLenny (00:04:04):\n哇，我喜欢这个想法。那该多酷啊。其实我职业生涯刚开始时也是一名工程师。如果我们能回到原点，那将是多么有趣。不管怎样，我觉得从“工程领域正在发生什么变化”开始会很有趣。过去几年似乎发生了很多变化，特别是从 ZIRP (零利率政策) 时代转变为今天的市场，情况大不相同。从工程师的角度来看，你认为变化最大的是什么？你又如何告诉工程领导者们去应对这一切变化？\n\nWill Larson (00:04:32):\n我认为现在是市场中一个相当奇特的时期。我是在 2008 年经济崩溃前夕开始工作的。所以最初的两年并不太好。当我加入雅虎（Yahoo）时，基本上每四个月就有一次某种形式的裁员，非常混乱。但随后我们进入了过去十年，那段时间非常平稳：数字在增长，收入在增长，员工人数在增长，人们开始学习如何构建超大型团队。\n\n(00:05:02):\n人们开始学习如何大量招聘。当我在 Uber 时，有时我会连续进行六场面试。我就待在会议室里，到最后你甚至记不得在和谁说话，因为一个接一个谈了太多人。你手里只有一些之后试着去解读的潦草笔记。\n\n(00:05:20):\n现在完全不同了。18 个月前，许多工程经理会花一半或更多的时间在招聘上，而现在他们一个月只做两次面试，甚至更少，也许一个月零面试。所以人们投入到招聘中的时间发生了真正的转变。取而代之的是，各种不同的胜任力变得更加关键。一个优秀的工程总监过去可能只要把招聘做得很好就能成为顶尖人才，但现在那个人无法展示他们的擅长之处了。\n\n(00:05:51):\n如果那个人没有搞清楚如何领导团队、深入细节，以及有时去弄清楚什么是正确的资源分配（allocation）、什么是工程团队的正确规模（sizing），那么他可能会被视为表现不佳。这些在以前我们讨论得并不多。也许如果你真的惹恼了 CEO，或者在基础设施部门，你下一年的增长会慢一点。但现在情况完全不同了，团队正在消失，团队正在缩减，团队正在整合。我们在 ZIRP 时代避开了这些，但现在这已成为许多工作的核心部分。\n\nLenny (00:06:27):\n感觉工程师们以前在公司内部拥有很大的议价权（leverage），我想这也在发生重大变化。\n\nWill Larson (00:06:37):\n我认为确实如此。从某种角度看，我认为这对工程师来说实际上是有害的。我经常挂在嘴边的一个观点（hobby horse）是：我认为我们经常把工程师当成孩子对待，而不是赋予他们责任和能力，让他们像成年人一样真正地成长。比如我们会说：“噢，工程师不会想做那项工作的。”\n\n(00:06:53):\n让工程师远离那些重要的事情，其实对他们并没有好处。实际上，我认为最值得关注的亮点之一是，我们正在回归到一个可以把工程师视为同僚、让他们担任高级领导职务的时刻，而不再基于“噢，我们必须娇惯他们或让他们远离真实问题”这种基本假设。这也是他们获得成长机会的方式。这是我眼中近期转变的一个亮点。\n\nLenny (00:07:18):\n我确实在这种环境下工作过，也经历过那种不想惹恼工程师的情况。那么，你的意思是，因为这种情况正在改变，领导者们也许不必那么担心让工程师不开心，而且你认为我们通常本来就不应该那样对待工程师？\n\nWill Larson (00:07:33):\n是的，我认为两者兼而有之。但在之前的那个时代，招聘和留存率（retention）是评估中层管理人员最重要的指标之一。失去团队成员是一个巨大的问题。所以你开始变得有点娇惯他们，这实际上很糟糕——再次强调，这对工程师不好，对团队不好，对所有人都不好，对组织的效率也不好。但现在我喜欢的一点是，我们可以给工程师真正的难题，我们可以真正地让他们承担问责制（hold them accountable）。这意味着我们可以让他们担任资深职务。\n\n(00:08:07):\n我一直在推动的一件事——我写了我的上一本书《Staff Engineer》，关于资深工程师的职业路径。其中的挑战之一是，如果我们因为只想留住所有工程师而不敢让他们承担责任，我们就无法让他们担任资深职位。所以我认为我们正在看到一种转变，我们可以真正地要求他们负责，这意味着我们可以让他们担任资深职务，意味着工程师实际上可以得到他们一直想要的东西，而此前我们因为过于娇惯他们而无法做到这一点。\n\nLenny (00:08:33):\n好的。我想从几个方向展开讨论，我会先试探一下，看看能深入到哪里。首先，你非常推崇系统思维（Systems Thinking）。我们之前聊过这个。我想很多人都听过这个词，也有相关的书籍，听起来很棒。我也想成为一个系统思维者。但这到底意味着什么？你在工作中是如何应用它的？人们该如何更好地掌握这种思维方式？\n\nWill Larson (00:08:57):\n我合作过的一些最不成功但最聪明的人，都是系统思维的强烈倡导者。所以我想说，每种框架都有很多弊端。没有哪种框架是人们可以一以贯之、普遍适用并获得好结果的。简单谈谈这个，我经常看到人们发现他们的系统模型与现实发生冲突时，他们会说：“现实错了。” 那么，举个具体的例子？\n\n(00:09:28):\n在 Stripe，我们负责故障管理（Incident Management）。Stripe 是一个非常重要的公司，提供 API（应用程序接口）。如果 API 挂了，你就会赔钱；如果你赔了很多钱，你就会离开 Stripe，因为你会非常生气。企业首要的任务就是为他们销售的服务成功收钱，对吧？Stripe 至关重要。\n\n(00:09:49):\n于是我们对故障进行了大量分析，试图理解为什么事情没进展，我们能做得更好吗。但我们太沉迷于分析，以至于忽略了我们是否真的在改善现状。我们花了很长时间才意识到这一点，因为我们太纠结于系统思维模型了。这并不是说“团队错了”，而是“我错了”。我自己陷入了那个模型，没意识到：“嘿，我们其实并没有优先考虑改进，我们只是在优先考虑衡量。” 衡量不能一直持续下去。虽然说“量两次，剪一次（三思而后行）”，但你不能衡量无限次却从不动刀。\n\n(00:10:25):\n在某些时刻，你必须果断采取行动才能真正产生影响。但我们当时在那儿有点陷入僵局了。我认为很多过度沉迷于系统思考（Systems Thinking，一种通过理解整体及其各部分相互关系来解决问题的思维方式）的人都会犯同样的错误，即认为现实是错误的。但现实永远不会错，现实永远是对的。如果你的模型与现实发生冲突，那么错的永远是模型。但这种冲突和差距其实非常有趣，那是你学习的地方。\n\n(00:10:49):\n所以我有了这个模型。它非常简洁，代表了你的招聘管线（Hiring Pipeline，招聘流程中各阶段的路径），以及在不同步骤中的流转。它也代表了你的事故以及你如何修复事故。当你熟练之后，它几乎可以很快地为任何事情建模。然后，通过理解现实如何与模型发生冲突，你开始明白自己的心理模型（Mental Model，对外部世界运作方式的解释）哪里出错了，接着你可以去学习并改进模型，如此循环往复。\n\n(00:11:12):\n在某个节点上，模型已经足够接近现实了，你就可以停止建模，真正去动手干活了。所以我告诉人们最重要的一点是：这是一种很好的学习方式，但你同时也必须付诸行动。你不能只学习，学习并不是我们工作的全部。\n\nLenny (00:11:25):\n为了更具体一点，你会如何描述“系统思考（Systems Thinking）”这个概念？有没有什么好的切入点能让人觉得“噢，我明白你在说什么了”？\n\nWill Larson (00:11:32):\n这可能是一个比我刚才胡乱扯一段轶事更好的开始。\n\nLenny (00:11:38):\n我们可以倒着来，效果会很棒。\n\nWill Larson (00:11:41):\n系统思考（Systems Thinking）基本上就是尝试用存量（Stocks，系统中随时间积累的元素）和流量（Flows，进出存量的部分）来思考。存量（Stocks）是积累的东西，而流量（Flows）则是从一个存量到另一个东西的移动。存量的一个简单例子是什么？存量可以是湖里鱼的数量，也可以是湖里钓鱼的人数。那么这两者之间的流量可以是：湖里鱼的数量会根据湖里钓鱼人数的多少，以某种速率减少。\n\n(00:12:08):\n所以，如果有很多渔民，鱼的存量（Stock）下降就会更快。如果只有几个渔民，下降就会更慢。但同时还有一些流量（Flows）决定了这一点，比如如果我们有了效率更高的渔民，流出的鱼量可能会下降，但鱼也会繁殖。所以又有另一个回流的流量。基于当前的鱼量和繁殖率，以及当前的渔民数量和他们的捕鱼率，你就能看到这些东西如何随着时间推移而演变。这涉及很多方面。\n\n(00:12:38):\n首先，我总是推荐德内拉·梅多斯（Donella Meadows）写的《系统之美》（Thinking In Systems）。那真是一本非凡的著作。她的很多作品也参考了瑞秋·卡森（Rachel Carson）在《寂静的春天》（Silent Spring）中的研究，书中谈到了少量的致癌物（Carcinogens）或生态系统底层的物质，在食物链（Food chain）中被更高级的捕食者消费后，浓度会越来越高。这是一个经典的系统思考问题：你可能不会认为小鱼体内少量的致癌物有什么大不了，但随着它们进入食物链上层，浓度开始聚集，意想不到的变化就会发生。\n\nLenny (00:13:14):\n那么回到你刚才提到的招聘管线（Hiring Pipeline）的例子，让我们用它来连接这个定义——这个定义我以前从未听过，非常棒且清晰——看看你是如何在招聘中实际应用它的。\n\nWill Larson (00:13:23):\n第一步是先建立一个任何形式的模型。你要思考你的存量（Stocks）。在招聘管线（Hiring Pipeline）中，你可能有潜在候选人（Potential Candidates），这基本上是无限的，然后你有几个流入量（Inflows）。你可能有搜寻（Sourced，通过搜索找到人选）、主动触达（Outreach）、内推（Referrals），然后你就有了候选人。有多少人被搜寻到，这可能是你为某个角色投入的搜寻人员（Sourcers）数量的函数。所以你会拥有另一个关于“搜寻人员数量”的存量，这会影响从潜在候选人到实际搜寻到的候选人的速率。\n\n(00:13:59):\n然后，对于你在这个“盒子”里的候选人，你会有一个通过第一轮招聘人员筛选（Recruiter Screen）的转化率（Conversion Rate），他们会进入流程的第二步。在第二步，你可能会有招聘经理筛选（Hiring Manager Screen），那是另一个转化率。所以你可以看到随着时间的推移，那些在 LinkedIn 上闲逛、发布深刻见解的无限潜在候选人，是如何转化为实际的初面、二面、三面人选的。\n\n(00:14:26):\n但当你深入研究时，你会开始看到有趣的现象。对于许多候选人管线（Pipelines）来说，最大的问题是招聘经理（Hiring Managers）不想发出任何录取通知（Offers），因为招聘经理无法对任何候选人建立信心。你会发现在这个管线中，有大量候选人进入了发录取阶段，但几乎没有人能从“潜在录取”转化为“实际录取”。这时你就可以说：“嘿，问题出在这里。你需要去和招聘人员及招聘经理沟通，让他们对该雇佣谁建立起信念。”\n\n(00:14:56):\n这是新手经理的经典问题，对吧？第二个问题是：经理想要发出大量的录取通知（Offers），他们确实发了，但没有一个人接受。这会让你关注到第二个问题。但还有第三种可能的情况，即实际上你没有吸引到足够的候选人。你在做决策和谈入职（Closing candidates）方面做得很好，只是进来的候选人不够。通过观察并建立这个模型，你可以去你的申请者跟踪系统（Applicant Tracking System, ATS，管理招聘流程的软件），比如 Greenhouse 或类似的系统，提取历史数据，对比实际数据与预期数据的差异。\n\n(00:15:32):\n你可以看到流失点（Drop-offs），这有助于你弄清楚应该首先尝试去修复哪里。我想我们都在那样的公司工作过：在没有任何数据支持的情况下推行重大变革，仅仅因为“哦，感觉我们在评估候选人时不够严厉”之类。于是你去改了一大堆东西。但通常真正的问题可能是招聘经理在给那些根本没通过面试流程（Loop）的人发录取。只是因为经理们感到恐慌，所以发了太多录取通知。现在这种情况少见了，但在十年前……不，不是十年前，两年前，招聘经理为了发录取而感到恐慌，这是经常发生的真实情况。这能帮助你将一个复杂的、抽象的问题转化为可以系统化处理的任务。\n\nLenny (00:16:17):\n我觉得产品经理（Product Managers）要么天然地就以这种方式做事，因为他们中的很多人都以漏斗（Funnels）的方式思考。听到这种关于“跟踪存量在不同步骤流量中穿行”的版本非常有趣。太棒了。我知道你非常热衷并花大量时间思考的另一件事是工程策略（Engineering Strategy）。我觉得你有一种感觉，认为工程师对最终策略思考得不够。其他职能部门都有策略，而工程师通常没有。聊聊你在那方面的发现以及你的建议。\n\nWill Larson (00:16:52):\n首先，我开始怀疑在大多数公司里，是否有任何职能部门真正拥有策略（Strategy）。我普遍的经验是，很少有公司会有书面的战略。有时它只是一句价值观陈述，比如“我们打造最高品质的产品”，然后你会觉得：“好吧，我该拿这个怎么办？”接着你会想：“那就打造高品质产品吧。”然后又会觉得：“好吧，我不知道那具体意味着什么。”\n\n(00:17:15):\n工程部门经常遇到这个问题，人们会在 Culture Amp（注：一种员工反馈和调查平台）或季度调查中评论说：“嘿，策略不清晰”或者“工程策略在哪里？”每当工程师抱怨时，他们也会抱怨产品策略——觉得产品经理（PMs）没有任何策略，或者业务没有策略。而现实是，产品、工程和业务总是有策略的，只是通常没有写下来。\n\n(00:17:45):\n所以我想做的第一件事是推动人们不要纠结于没有现成的模板（比如某人派生并填写的“产品策略模板”）。没有模板并不意味着你没有策略。你有策略，只是可能有点难以表达，或者因为没有写下来，在产品汇报链的不同层级之间应用得不一致。但绝不存在“没有产品策略”的情况，产品策略总是存在的。有时它很烂，但总归是有的。工程也是如此，总会有工程策略，只是有时很烂。\n\n(00:18:21):\n策略的第一条规则是：如果你把它写下来，你就能改进它。如果没有写下来，就很难判断是这个产品经理（PM）本身不够优秀，还是他们在尝试应用一个被他们误解的策略，抑或是他们正确地应用了来自产品负责人的策略、但该策略并不适用于他们正在处理的问题——你该如何调试（Debug）这些情况？\n\n(00:18:43):\n如果你有一份书面文件，即使它不是一个非常有说服力的策略，至少你可以开始调试。比如：“嘿，产品负责人应该提高这份文档的清晰度”；或者“嘿，这个产品经理实际上应用得不对”；或者“嘿，这个策略对这个业务单元不合适，虽然对其他单元有意义”。\n\n(00:19:02):\n这是我思考的第一点。关于策略的第二个大主题是，好的策略通常是如此枯燥，以至于很难谈论。例如，在工程方面，一个非常典型、极好但又非常枯燥的策略是：我们只使用现有的工具。很多时候，工程师会想要引入新的编程语言、新的数据库、新的云服务商。而对于几乎所有公司来说，一个非常好的策略就是：“我们只使用今天已有的标准工具集（Standard Kit）。”\n\n(00:19:39):\n在 Carta，当我加入时，一位名叫 Eric Vogel 的工程师编写了标准工具集（Standard Kit），这就是我们使用工具的策略。你知道吗？有些人对此感到非常沮丧，我也很同情他们。这让他们觉得失去了控制。但这些枯燥策略的力量在于，它让人们的精力集中在公司所重视的问题上。所以，如果你随着时间的推移产生了一点偏差，重新对齐的过程是痛苦的，但那些告诉你什么才是真正重要、并让你与公司真正关心的利益保持一致的枯燥策略，对你来说是非常有益的，即使它们有时让你感到烦恼。我可以详细展开这个想法，但我不会没完没了地唠叨。\n\nLenny (00:20:21):\n嗯，也许更有帮助的是，你还见过哪些其他的工程策略示例？这样可以给大家更多启发，比如“噢，也许这应该成为我们策略的一部分”。\n\nWill Larson (00:20:31):\n首先，策略（Strategy）的定义是什么？我见过的最好的定义来自理查德·鲁梅尔特（Richard Rumelt），他写了《好战略，坏战略》（Good Strategy, Bad Strategy）。\n\nLenny (00:20:40):\n他也要来参加这个播客了。\n\nWill Larson (00:20:42):\n太棒了。他还写了《关键点》（The Crux），我想是今年某个时候出版的，我也读了。我觉得两本书都很棒，他是一位非常有深度的思想家。我认为写战略的挑战之一在于，有些人可能只经历过两件事就写了一本书，但 Richard Rumelt 令人印象深刻的地方在于，他见过太多不同的场景，以至于他能够以一种非常有趣的方式，同时从具体案例和普遍规律及数据集（Dataset，一组相关的数据信息）出发。另一本具有类似特点的书是《大项目是如何完成的》（How Big Things Get Done），作者名字我忘了，但书中包含了一个关于大型项目如何成功和失败的惊人数据集（Dataset）。\n\n(00:21:21):\n但不管怎样，Richard Rumelt 对战略的定义基本上由三个部分组成。首先是诊断（Diagnosis）：当前的现状（Status Quo）是什么？今天现实的情况是什么？然后是指导方针（Guiding Policies）：基本上是基于诊断，你打算如何应对这些情况？最后是行动（Actions）：行动是我们如何实施这些指导方针。他谈到了很多关于行动的内容，因为他担心那种“僵化战略”（Inert Strategy）的想法，比如你说：“我们要弃用（Deprecate，不再使用旧功能或软件）那些不使用的旧产品功能，但实际上根本没人去处理它们。”\n\n(00:21:52):\n所以他非常担心这种无法执行、毫无用处的战略。在工程（Engineering）领域，我倒不那么担心这个。我认为工程战略的有趣之处在于它阐明了我们未来如何做决策。有哪些例子呢？在 Uber，我们只使用自己的数据中心（Data Centers）。我们不用云服务（Cloud）。虽然在我离开后的时代情况发生了变化，但在 2014 年那个时代，没有云服务，而且我们有一项严格的“禁云”政策。这很烦人，因为我们必须自己采购和配置（Indent）所有设备，或者自己运行所有系统的副本。\n\n(00:22:28):\n但这也意味着我们能够在短短三个月内就在中国快速启动（Spin up，指快速搭建并运行系统），那期间有一些超现实的故事。我们的机架（Racks，存放服务器的架子）塞不进数据中心，所以他们不得不拆掉数据中心的房顶，用起重机（Crane）把机架吊进去。\n\nLenny (00:22:43):\n我的天（Holy shit）。\n\nWill Larson (00:22:43):\n那有很多故事，所有这些都是在三个月内完成的，真的是现象级的。Uber 在中国呆的时间并不长，所以从某种程度上看，你会觉得：我们做了这么多努力就是为了撤出吗？但他们离开时带着滴滴快的的大量股份，总的来说结果并不坏。但我认为那个战略——“我们在数据中心运行一切，我们不用云服务”，意味着我们能够进出不同的地缘政治受限环境，而那些依赖云服务的公司则完全做不到。他们完全受限于 AWS（亚马逊云服务）、Google Cloud（谷歌云）或 Azure（微软云）的建设进度。这是一个很好的例子。\n\n(00:23:21):\nStripe 的另一个好例子是：我们运行一个 Ruby 单体架构（Ruby Monolith，一种将所有功能集成在一个应用中的架构），这就是我们的做法，当然之后也演进了一些。2023 年的 Stripe 比 2016 年或 2012 年拥有更多的 Java 代码。但那项政策确实让工程师们专注于为用户构建创新功能，而不是构建支持不同编程语言的各种工具链（Tooling）。所以在这两个案例中，无论是 Uber 关于运行自有数据中心的政策，还是 Stripe 关于 Ruby 单体架构的政策，很多工程师其实都很讨厌这些规定。\n\n(00:24:02):\n但好的战略目标不是为了讨好所有人。好战略的目标是规定我们如何将有限的能力（Capacities）或有限的资源投入到我们关心的核心问题中。我认为这两者在这方面都非常有效。\n\nLenny (00:24:17):\n所有这些例子中的一个共同主题本质上是约束（Constraint），决定我们将限制我们的选项，以便移动得更快，并专注于真正重要的事情。\n\nWill Larson (00:24:28):\n对我来说，解决约束（Constraints）正是战略真正发挥作用的最有趣之处。我认为当我们谈论失败的战略时，通常是因为诊断（Diagnosis）做得不好，通常是因为人们在约束条件上强加了他们主观希望的现实，比如，“嘿，我们可以同时进行所有这些项目。”这通常不是真的，但很难说服那些身为 CEO 或者对此深信不疑的人。几乎所有糟糕的战略基本上都源于对准确诊断（Diagnosis）的刻意不信，这意味着你的指导方针（Guiding Policies）从一开始就是不连贯的（Incoherent）。\n\nLenny (00:25:08):\n太棒了。我很期待 Richard 的那一集，我们将深入探讨战略。不过也许作为一个收尾话题，如果有人想提高工程战略（Eng Strategy）或通用战略的能力，你有什么建议吗？是读这些书吗？还有别的吗？\n\nWill Larson (00:25:26):\n如果人们想擅长战略，虽然有很多不同类型的战略，但以下是我真心推荐的一些建议。首先，我认为 Richard Rumelt 的那本《好战略，坏战略》（Good Strategy, Bad Strategy）可能是最合适的起点。我觉得《关键点》（The Crux）也很棒，但也许我会把它作为第二本读物。它很好地概述了如何思考战略。另外还有《系统思考》（Thinking in Systems），我之前提到过，这与系统思维有关。战略的一大部分在于能够模拟现实，以便改进你的诊断。\n\n(00:25:56):\n所以我觉得那本书也非常好。如果你进入工程领域，这里有很多有趣的著作。比如 Evan Hewitt 的《技术战略模式》（Technology Strategy Patterns），Anderson、McCann 和 O'Reilly 写的《价值飞轮效应》（The Value Flywheel effect），还有 Kim、Behr 和 Spafford 写的《凤凰项目》（The Phoenix Project），它是 Goldratt 的《目标》（The Goal）的现代重写版。但我认为这个领域仍然缺乏一本真正权威的（Canonical）典范书籍。所以我在我即将出版的新书《工程高管手册》（The Engineering Executive's Primer）中尝试探讨了战略，该书明年初出版。\n\n(00:26:33):\n在我之前的书《参谋工程师》（Staff Engineer）中也尝试讨论过，但我仍然觉得这里缺一本书。所以我梦想着为我的下一个项目写一本专门讨论工程战略的书，尽管还不确定最终是否能成行。\n\nLenny (00:26:48):\n那我们顺着写作这个话题聊下去，这也是我非常想聊的内容。你写了很多东西。你写了两本、三本、大概四本了？你正在写一本新书。你已经出版了多少本书？两本，第三本快出了。\n\nWill Larson (00:27:00):\n我有两本书。第一本是和 Stripe Press 合作的，第二本是自费出版的，第三本是和 O'Reilly 合作的，大概两个月后出版。\n\nLenny (00:27:08):\n好的。而且多年来你还写了非常非常多的博客文章（Blog posts）。我问了几个人该问你什么，这个问题被反复提及，Gergely Orosz 和 ByteByteGo 的 Alex Xu 都问了这个问题：“你如何挤出时间写这么多东西？”然后我也想问一下，写作对你的职业生涯产生了什么影响？你为什么坚持这样做？\n\nWill Larson (00:27:37):\n我强烈感觉到，如果你写的是你想写的东西，你能写得更多。这也是我不为了经济利益（Financial gain）写作，也不太按预定计划（Schedule）写作的原因之一。我为杂志等写过几篇文章，但我发现如果你必须确定一个主题，并且必须在主题上达成一致，这真的很消耗精力（Draining）。如果一个话题开始偏离你想写的内容，很多时候你无法修改它，而且你还面临着截止日期。你会觉得：“啊，我要搞砸了，我得把这个发出去，明天就得完成。”\n\n(00:28:12):\n我发现那真的很累。相反，当我拥有时间表的主动权，当我写某些东西时——比如几年前我开始写一本基础设施工程（Infrastructure Engineering）的书。当时感觉不对，我没法把它整合在一起，所以我就停下来了。我不再写那本书了。也许我以后会回头再写，但可能不会了。\n\n(00:28:34):\n对我来说，写你所爱最大的优势在于，你可以在有精力的地方写作，而不需要在没有精力的地方强求，那会让你变得非常消极。这也关系到我写书的方式，基本上我会在开始与出版商（Publisher）合作之前写完整本书。如果你足够用心（Diligent）且擅长预判他们的顾虑，你基本上可以重用你正在写的内容。在我写这类书中，这更容易做到。\n\n(00:29:05):\n我觉得在写那种非常技术性的 MySQL 入门书时可能更难，你不能随便重新排列（Resequence）那些章节并指望它能行得通。那些章节的构建方式与我写的商业类书籍不同。写那些能带给你能量的内容，放弃那些不带能量的内容，这就是我能写这么多的秘诀，也是我坚持写了 16 年的原因。我保持写作的方式就是写那些有能量感的东西，写我当下正在思考的东西。\n\n(00:29:38):\n我不写我没在思考的东西，我也不为任何特定的受众（Audience）写作，我只写我觉得有趣的。这意味着有些人不喜欢它，这没关系。这完全没问题。这本来就不是写给他们的，是写给那些想随我一起思考的人的，这就是我的关注点。\n\nLenny (00:29:57):\n本集节目由 Vanta

(00:31:00):\n我猜大约有一千篇。这大概是我的估算。我想有几年我写了几百篇，如果你坚持那样写三年，积累到一千篇并不难。\n\nLenny (00:31:16):\n这太不可思议了，尤其是因为你这些年来一直承担着高强度的工作。非常高压、快速发展的超高速增长（Hypergrowth）公司。你居然能找到时间写作。所以首先，让我深入探讨（Double click）并赞同（Co-sign）你关于“关注什么能带给你能量”以及“在真正好奇的事情上投入”的建议。这正是我给别人的建议。很多人开始这种全职作家或创作者的生活，他们会想：“人们想要什么？人们想让我写什么？什么会火？什么能激发疯传（Go viral）？”\n\n(00:31:48):\n偶尔做几次这种事很容易，但随后你最终会为自己创造一份并不想要的工作。如果你对 AI（人工智能）或当下流行的任何事物并不那么感兴趣，你肯定不想整天都在写关于 AI 的东西。我发现最重要的一点是，你所写内容的 80% 到 90% 必须是你自己真正感兴趣的东西。剩下的那一小部分可以是：“这里有一些我知道人们非常想要的东西。这里有一些我知道会表现得非常出色的内容。” 因为否则的话，你就会产生 Burnout（职业倦怠）。你会为自己创造一份你并不想要的工作。为什么要那样做呢？\n\nWill Larson (00:32:13):\n是的，我百分之百同意这一点。我认为另一件事是，每个人都会趋向于写那些他们认为“人们想要看”的东西。比如两年前是 Crypto（加密货币），现在是 AI（人工智能），或者是 Counter AI（反人工智能），比如“AI 将毁灭世界”。在这种情况下很难说出什么新颖的见解，原因有二：第一，每个人都试图在谈论它；第二，这几乎肯定不是你非常擅长的领域。而如果你只是坚守在自己的 Lane（擅长领域），我认为对作者来说最大的风险就是 Quitting（放弃）。\n\n(00:32:43):\n这有点像“40 年职业生涯”的理念。任何形式的内容创作，最大的风险都是因为倦怠而过早放弃。最大的风险不是你最初增长得太慢。人们总有一种“你错过了浪潮”的感觉。比如：现在加入 Substack（付费订阅写作平台）太晚了，顶级作者已经在那儿了，你永远成不了顶级作者；现在做 Podcast（播客）太晚了，播客太多了，你永远不会成功；现在加入 Medium（长文写作平台）太晚了，你永远无法脱颖而出，那里的作者太多了。\n\n(00:33:11):\n但这根本不是真的。如果你只是持续地写出好东西，你会随着时间的推移建立起受众，并且你可以带着这些受众在不同的平台间迁移。真正重要的是找到某种你实际上可以在未来十年里坚持做下去的事情。这比只做一年要难得多。\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\n我们在这方面的建议完全一致。这正是我告诉每个人的话。当我加入 Substack 时，我也觉得太晚了，我想：“天哪，红利期结束了。” 当我开始做这个播客时，我也想：“噢，天哪，世界上有十亿个播客，怎么可能成功呢？” 所以我非常认同，我也非常认同这整件事是一个……这是一个 Long game（长线博弈）。竞争的人很多。我常说，开始一份 Newsletter（邮件通讯）很容易，但坚持下去很难。没有人能真正坚持下去，因为人们总是来来去去。真正区分成功与失败的，就是那些能够坚持下去的人。这没有所谓的 End game（终局），它是一个 Infinite game（无限游戏），关键在于能否长期维持下去。\n\nWill Larson (00:34:04):\n你并不是在与其他内容创作者竞争。如果你把它看作一场 Infinite game（无限游戏），你们是在共同努力，你们可以互相帮助成长。Product writers（产品领域的作者）或 Thinkers（思想者）的数量并没有上限。你并不会因为 [此处听不清 00:34:22] 的存在而变得不那么成功。那里不存在竞争。这是一种 False dichotomy（虚假的对立/非黑即白的二分法）。\n\nLenny (00:34:27):\n是的，我完全同意。除非作者数量多到一定程度，然后突然发生的情况是 Bar（门槛/标准）会变得更高，这是好事，因为这样人们就能得到更好的内容，这没关系。这种情况无论如何都会发生。随着内容越来越多，门槛会持续提高。对我来说，你最终必须做对的事情就是那个 Bar（门槛）。你必须达到一个很高的水准，才能让别人关心你写的任何东西。正如你所说的，要做好这一点，你必须对所写的内容感到兴奋，具备背景知识，并且有能够贡献的价值。\n\n(00:34:59):\n我只是在这儿感慨，但我对这件事的看法是，你需要为对话增加一些新的东西，才能让别人关注，因为现在有太多 Fluffy（空洞的）、Superficial（肤浅的）内容。要让别人在意，你需要说一些别人以前没听过的新观点，或者分享他们在其他地方没见过的新信息。\n\nWill Larson (00:35:15):\n我完全同意。我可以就这个问题聊上整整一节课，但我不想偏离主题，但我完全同意。\n\nLenny (00:35:23):\n我们要克制一下。那么，进入非常 Tactical（战术/实操）的层面，我想这是很多人一直好奇的：你如何挤出时间？你的 Workflow（工作流）是什么样的？你如何在拥有一份紧张的全职工作的情况下，还能为写作腾出时间并坚持下去？\n\nWill Larson (00:35:34):\n在我有孩子之前，我的做法有所不同。我现在有一个三岁半的孩子，一旦有了孩子，你生活的 Timing（时间分配）就会发生巨大的变化。但我发现最重要的一点是，寻找那些与我正在做的工作直接相关的写作素材。在这种情况下，我可以做一些既能帮助工作，又能同时帮助写作的事情，因为我认为挤出时间去写那些与工作毫无关系的东西是极其困难的。\n\n(00:36:05):\n而且这会分散你对工作的注意力，因为这些工作……特别是如果你处于 Senior role（资深职位），这些工作的要求可能非常高。但它们的挑战并不是因为你每隔五六分钟就要回复 Slack（企业通讯软件）上的紧急私信，而是因为你需要非常出色地做出一些极其困难的决策。我认为撰写相关主题的文章是 Refine your thinking（完善思维）和提高表现的好方法。这并不是一种 Conflict（冲突），也不是说你要么写作，要么做好工作。\n\n(00:36:34):\n要么写作，要么做好工作——我认为你可以找到一种方式让两者 Align（对齐/统一）。所以很多做播客的人会采访那些与他们在工作中思考的内容相关的人，这是他们学习、建立 Network（社交网络）、完善思维、并向该领域专家测试自己想法的好方法。这与工作并不冲突，而是高度契合。这是其中一点。但是，是的，我也对我的日程表做了很多调整。\n\n(00:36:58):\n在我有孩子之前，通常周六是写作日，所以早上和下午早些时候都会用来写作。现在我不能那样做了，所以我现在大多在晚上写作，从 Energy management（能量管理）的角度来看，这很具挑战性。但我会说，最重要的事情是，如果你真的对某件事感到兴奋，你会找到时间和精力。如果你不兴奋，而且现在是晚上 9 点，你只会想睡觉。所以我真心认为，你必须有意识地安排时间，但我们谈到的关于能量管理的第一点，两者是结合在一起的。当你的日程变紧时，如果你没有动力，你就无法完成。而且为什么要强迫自己呢？这没有意义。\n\nLenny (00:37:41):\n为了结束这个话题，对于那些想要写更多东西、知道这很有价值、但还没开始的人，你有没有什么 Tip（建议）可以给他们，让他们“上车”？\n\nWill Larson (00:37:51):\n这取决于人们为什么要写作。我告诉人们，如果你只是想写一些能帮助你职业发展的东西，你应该集中精力写出两到三个非常棒的内容，并花大量时间起草、修改、获取反馈。你只需要专注于打造一个或两三个伟大的 Artifacts（作品/产出物）。如果你的目标只是创造一些能够展示你是深度思考者、并帮助你在行业中定位的作品，你不需要创建一个每周发布的长期运行的博客。\n\n(00:38:21):\n如果你只是想在行业中稍微提升一下自己，不要开始做 Newsletter（邮件通讯）。只需写出两到三篇非常优质的东西。这是我要说的第一点。但如果你的目标是长期、持续地大量写作，我最大的建议就是：发布（Publish）。现在有很多人手里攥着成百上千个 Drafts（草稿），但什么都没发布。而我的做法是，我几乎发布我写的每一篇东西。如果有一篇东西我觉得我不会发布，我就根本不会开始写，因为我会先在脑子里快速检查一下：这是我可以写出来并发布的东西吗？\n\n(00:38:56):\n如果我的答案是“不”，我就根本不开始。随着我写得越来越多，我的这种判断准确度也越来越高，但我几乎发布我写的每一件作品。这就是为什么有些内容并不那么出色。那没关系。再说一次，我想写，我想把这些想法表达出来。我想展示我关注的重点，以及我作为一个思考者的进化——试图学习如何在这些不同公司的不同角色中运作。我写作不是为了创造一个抛光到完美的艺术品，我也不是为了最大限度地提高读者的阅读体验。\n\n(00:39:27):\n有些人不喜欢这种方式，我认为那是完全合理的，但我认为我能带给你的是我作为一个 Operator（实操者/运营者）正在积极学习和思考的经验。我认为这对行业内其他的实操者来说非常有价值。至于给你完美的文字，我也在尝试朝那个方向努力，虽然我不确定是否达到了完美，但那是我的书所追求的。书是将几年来的思想精华收集起来，进行清理和包装。它们的质量比我典型的日常写作要高得多。\n\n(00:39:56):\n但是，是的，只管大量发布吧。不要担心质量。有时人们会给你发一些愚蠢的反馈，我现在根本不回应那些东西了。你永远不知道为什么别人会给你发那样的东西。我认为试图去 Debug people（调试/纠偏他人，这里指分析陌生人的负面心理）是浪费时间。就像是，“谢谢，下一位。甚至不要花时间去担心它。”\n\nLenny (00:40:19):\n我喜欢“Debug people”这个词。我认为人们大大高估了别人对你产出内容的在意程度。大多数人只会看三秒钟，然后心想：“呃（没感觉）。” 基本上最坏的情况就是“我不关心这个”。而不是“噢，Will 真是个笨蛋，这话说的太蠢了”，对吧？没人有时间干那事。\n\nWill Larson (00:40:38):\n如果他们真的那么做了，那是他们的问题，对吧？互联网很大，人很多，总会有人在遇到你做的事情时刚好心情很糟糕，他们会把那种愤怒或挫败感发泄在你身上，但这与你无关。那只是你刚好在他参与互动时出现在那里。你不需要承受这些。那不是你的处境。没关系的。\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\n而且，当你刚开始起步时，那是写作压力最小的时候，因为没人知道你，也没人看。所以那时候可以“尝试所有疯狂的想法……尽管去做”。随着你逐渐积累受众，压力只会越来越大。\n\nWill Larson (00:41:15):\n是的，绝对是这样。千真万确。\n\nLenny (00:41:18):\n好，换个话题。有很多 PM（产品经理）在听这个节目。PM 经常思考的一件事是如何与他们的工程师、他们的 Eng managers（工程经理，简称 EM）建立更好的关系。关于如何与工程师和 EM 建立更高效、更愉快的工作关系，你能给产品经理们提供什么建议？\n\nWill Larson (00:41:37):\n核心问题在于，在我合作过的大多数 EM 和 PM 同行中……存在两个核心问题。第一，有时 Incentives（激励机制/利益动机）是不一致的，这很难处理。但如果你能对彼此诚实并理解对方的激励动机，有时你能找到折中方案。但有时 EM 和 PM 会产生分歧，仅仅是因为他们的激励动机相差太远，无法达成共识。这可能与 Timeline（时间线）有关，或者与为了 Sales（销售）而答应某些需求有关。或者工程师会说：“嘿，我们绝对不能答应那个需求。” 而 PM 会说：“实际上，我们要答应它，因为这对我晋升非常重要，”或者类似的情况。\n\n(00:42:19):\n事情真的有这么简单吗？其实从来没有那么简单。人们往往会为了给自己共事的人找个“反派”角色，而编造出一些简单化的叙事。在职场中其实并没有真正的反派，有的只是带着复杂的激励机制（Incentives）、处理着复杂事务的普通人。但有时我会和一些工程经理（EM，Engineering Manager）聊天，他们会认为：“噢，产品经理（PM，Product Manager）之所以答应那个需求，纯粹是因为他们想升职，因为销售人员会参与他们的晋升评审之类的。”\n\n(00:42:40):\n现实情况远没有那么简单。现实是，业务需要销售产品才能维持运转。你不能只是一味地拒绝而期望业务能取得成功，那也行不通。所以，第一点是要理解激励机制（Incentives）。而另一点，我认为这也是更常见的情况，就是 EM 或 PM 根本不理解对方的需求，在还没弄明白之前就开始争论。所以我给 EM 和 PM 最大的建议是：在试图解决冲突之前——比如急于交付某个功能或急于改变方法——请先确保你真正理解了对方在意的是什么。\n\n(00:43:17):\n有一种观点认为，你必须做出权衡（Trade-offs），而且在这一领域有无数艰难的权衡要做。但我的经验是，如果你能真正深入地了解每个人的需求，通常会有一个折中方案，能让每个人都得到他们真正想要的东西，而且并不需要花费更多时间。你只需要愿意深挖下去，去理解每一方的真实需求。顺便说一下，真实需求往往不是他们口头上说的那些，这也是造成困惑的部分原因。\n\nLenny (00:43:45):\n关于激励机制（Incentives）这一点，你有没有见过什么有效的解决方法？因为如果 PM 的绩效评估（Performance reviews）是基于影响力的，而工程团队的绩效评估是基于有趣的项目或系统在线率（Uptime）的，你会努力去改变这些职级定义（Ladder definitions）吗？到底什么才能有效改善这种局面？\n\nWill Larson (00:44:05):\n我最核心的做法一直是尝试强制推行这样一种理念：EM 和 PM 这一对搭档是平级的伙伴，他们通常应该获得相同的绩效评级（Performance rating）。这里当然有例外，比如 EM 明显表现不佳，如果 EM 根本没法正常工作或团队不尊重他们，那显然不是 PM 的错。有时确实存在明显的表现不佳，但通常情况下，困难的局面并不是因为某个人表现得极差。那种情况很容易诊断，反而是简单的。但在两个人都表现不错，只是整体执行力（Execution）跟不上的情况下，我认为“两人绩效评级一致”的想法虽然会带来一定程度的痛苦，但能提供正确的视角。\n\n(00:44:56):\n此外，Carta 公司在这方面也做过一些尝试。我们的 CEO Henry 曾写过一篇关于“三位一体”（Trifectas）的博客文章，不仅针对 EM 和 PM，还包括业务负责人（Business leadership）。你们所有人都会根据评估和解决整套约束条件（Constraints）的能力来获得相同的评分，而不仅仅是基于你所属职能部门的约束。\n\nLenny (00:45:20):\n哇，这太有意思了。所以你的建议，或者说你正在实践的，听起来是让工程经理和 PM 获得相同的绩效评估等级？并且他们在同一个会议中被讨论。\n\nWill Larson (00:45:33):\n我们的首席产品官（CPO）Vrushali 和我会花相当多的时间一起进行绩效校准（Calibrating），以确保……再次强调，如果某人确实存在明显的问题，那会有例外。但平均而言，情况确实如此。而且我认为员工们也知道这一点，因为我们明确告诉过他们。我认为这种做法非常有力量。\n\nLenny (00:45:55):\n这真的很有趣。我从未听说过这种方法。这绝对能解决 EM/PM 之间的问题，或者……\n\nWill Larson (00:46:01):\n是的，现在的激励机制是共享的，这并不完美。平衡它们依然很难，他们仍然可能做出错误的权衡，但至少他们明白激励机制是绑定的。我认为这是一个非常强大的理念。\n\nLenny (00:46:15):\n这确实很有意思。我能想象有些公司甚至可能想把设计经理（Design managers）也纳入其中，再往前迈一步。\n\nWill Larson (00:46:23):\n不同公司中不同职能的角色和重要性差异很大，所以很难有一种通用的模式。你也可以想象，是否想让一名主任工程师（Staff engineer）加入其中。所以我认为这非常取决于具体的公司。但是，是的，我认为设计部门绝对可以参与进来，特别是对于像 Airbnb 这样以设计驱动（Design-led）的公司。\n\nLenny (00:46:43):\n哇，太有启发了。也许作为这部分的最后一个思考：如果一个 PM 在与他们的 EM 协作时遇到挑战，你认为 PM 们可能忽略了哪些工程经理觉得重要、或者可能感到压力大的事情？有些事 PM 可能会说：“噢，哇，我从来没想过那个。”\n\nWill Larson (00:47:00):\n我认为我历来见过的最大挑战之一，特别是在过去十年里，是这样一种观念：工程经理的工作是给他们的团队提供“有趣的工作”。这种情况在增长团队（Growth teams）中经常见到。增长团队觉得：“嘿，我们只需要做大量的实验。”而工程师觉得：“我想构建一些全新的东西。”工程经理被夹在中间，试图解决：“我们需要交付 50 个相当枯燥的实验，但他们想做全新的东西。我不知道该如何解决这个矛盾。”\n\n(00:47:30):\n所以这是一个棘手的时刻。优秀的 EM 会找到平衡的方法，但这是持续摩擦的最大来源，因为 EM 的团队告诉他们需要做一些 PM 根本看不到的事情。这让 EM 看起来像是完全不可靠的合作伙伴，因为他们试图解决的是这些“隐形约束”。这就是我认为需要进一步推动理解的地方，比如你可以问：“嘿，你一直坚持要把这个重写成一种新的编程语言。”\n\n(00:48:00):\n“在我看来，这简直是愚蠢至极的事情。到底发生了什么？”一旦你理解了，你可能还是不同意他们的看法，但至少你们可以就如何处理这些约束进行诚实的对话，而不是仅仅觉得：“伙计，你简直不敢相信我的 EM 搭档今天做了什么。那个蠢货做了某某事。”然后对你的同僚产生这种“受害者与大反派”的心态。\n\nLenny (00:48:24):\n我想花点时间讨论一个相关的话题，那就是如何衡量工程效能（Engineering velocity）和生产力（Productivity）。我想这可能是工程领导者被问到最普遍、也可能是最烦人的问题：我如何知道我的工程师们是否在以最快的速度移动？我们如何帮助他们移动得更快？对于如何衡量研发效能，你给工程领导者或团队什么建议？\n\nWill Larson (00:48:44):\n在这个行业内大量削减团队规模的时刻，这个问题变得更加突出。风投公司的董事会成员正在推动风险投资支持型公司的工程效率。工程师们正试图弄清楚：我们如何体现这一点？我们如何证明，相对于我们作为一个组织所拥有的员额（Headcount）和资金，我们的生产力是合适的？\n\n(00:49:09):\n天哪，这真的很难。人们尝试回答这些问题的第一个方法就是简单地根据资金量进行基准对齐（Benchmarking）。作为一个机械性的练习，这相当直接。你从风险投资基金或其他渠道获得一个数据集，然后计算出：“好吧，我们在研发（R&D）上应该投入多少？在工程上应该投入多少？在研发中的基础架构工程（Infrastructure engineering）上应该投入多少？”你可以把这些都列出基准，算出正确的数字。\n\n(00:49:40):\n问题在于，这是一种非常机械化、缺乏洞察驱动力的方法。它能给你一个能自圆其说的答案。这就像那句老话：“没人会因为买了 IBM 的产品而被开除”，虽然在我的职业生涯中这从未成真过。但这种理念认为，只要你有正确的基准数据，风投（VC）就不会因为你在工程上投入过多而责难你。但这实际上并不能帮助你达到正确的状态，它只是能让你的董事会不那么生你的气，这固然有用，因为如果董事会对你生气，你很难做好工作。\n\n(00:50:13):\n但从某种意义上说，它并没有用，因为它并没有真正帮助你有效地运行你的组织。接下来就是一个更难的中介问题：你如何真正知道你的研发团队或工程团队是否高效？我发现有几点：首先，如果你是一个优秀的领导者，你去和工程师交流，他们会告诉你……工程师知道他们的团队是否高效。如果效率不高，他们也会告诉你原因。虽然他们的诊断可能是错的，但你可以顺着这些蛛丝马迹开始深挖。\n\n(00:50:49):\n通常你会有更丰富的经验来分析这些抱怨，从而找出其中的根本原因。但是，是的，如果你只是持续性地去和团队沟通，你就会知道他们是否高效，然后你就可以去着手解决那些具体的问题。但同样，你不能告诉你的董事会：“噢，没问题，我和团队聊过了，他们挺好的。”我的直觉很准。因为他们怎么知道你的直觉准不准呢？\n\n(00:51:17):\n他们处理的是一个巨大的投资组合（Portfolio），他们接触的一些领导者很优秀，而另一些人的直觉则糟透了。他们到底该如何评估？我认为这很棘手。我尝试做的一般是两件事：第一，将工程评估与业务和产品目标对齐。我希望我们对产品目标负全部责任。如果我们做得很好，而产品在那边搞砸了，显然很多公司会以此为借口寻求安慰，但实际上我们在这里是为了支持产品，支持我们的客户去做一些有趣的事情。我们不是为了构建新奇的系统（Novel systems）而存在的，除非它能支持客户和产品。\n\n(00:51:59):\n所以，首先要尝试在目标上进行深度对齐。其次，我认为展示我们在过去六个月里所做的有价值的事项路线图（Roadmap）是非常强大的。我想有时人们会觉得：“我没有什么可以放在上面的。”那你就会意识到：“是的，这是一个真正的问题。”或者如果你有很多东西可以放上去，那就太棒了。我真的发现，如果你承诺并展示出你正在做的具有影响力的、有分量的重大事项的数量，并且你能解释其影响力，人们就会退后一步，给你空间。如果你无法填满那个列表，人们就会产生顾虑，而且理应如此，他们确实应该对此感到担心。\n\nLenny (00:52:36):\n有没有什么你觉得有用的指标（Metrics）或工具之类的？因为这些都是非常棒的建议，但我能想象每个人总是会问：“给我们一个正在追踪的数字，给我们这个仪表盘（Dashboard），看看工程师都在做什么。”\n\nWill Larson (00:52:49):\n过去十年中，在软件工程领导力和基础架构领域最具影响力的书籍之一是《Accelerate》，作者是 Nicole Forsgren、Gene Kim，我相信还有第三位作者，但我现在忘了。那是一本非常现象级的书，它提出了四个指标（即 DORA 指标）。它提出了交付周期（Lead time）、故障修复时间（Incident remediation time）、变更失败率（Failure rate）以及第四个指标。现在市面上至少有 50 家不同的初创公司在向你推销仪表盘，这些工具能把这些数据转化为指标，他们希望你就根据这些指标来评估你的团队。\n\n(00:53:30):\n挑战在于，这些确实是非常好的诊断指标 (Diagnosis Metrics)。比如，“嘿，我们的部署速度变慢了。这是为什么？我们该如何提速？”但部署慢并不能说明你们公司是好是坏，它只是告诉你们应该专注于改进哪里。它实际上并不会改变你们公司的本质。同样地，无论你的交付周期 (Lead Time，指从任务开始到完成的时间) 是快是慢，它只是告诉你应该在哪里投入资源，而不能据此判断是否应该解雇工程师之类的事情。那些决定需要更具体、更深入的细节。\n\n(00:54:00):\n人们确实喜欢看这些指标，就像看系统正常运行时间指标 (Uptime Metrics) 一样。很多工程师会向董事会报告 Sprint Points (敏捷开发点数，用于衡量团队工作量的单位) 之类的数据，这完全是些虚假的东西，根本不值得报告。但人们能从中获得一些慰藉。所以，我在这里最大的感触是，当人们进行测量时——这不仅仅是工程领域的问题——他们往往会采取专家的视角，告诉你为什么不要测量一切。他们能解释为什么每个指标都是错误或不准确的，从而排除掉所有指标，结果导致什么都不测量。然后他们去找那些非专家的人，说：“其实，没有准确的指标可以提供。”\n\n(00:54:37):\n对那些非专家的人来说，这听起来就像你不知道自己在做什么。所以，你必须适应去测量一些虽然不完美、但确实可以测量并报告的东西。对于那些不完美的指标，当人们提出疑问时，正是教育大家的好机会：为什么这个指标是不完美的？它遗漏了哪些东西？或者谈话中隐藏了哪些误区。\n\n(00:54:59):\n指标的意义在于教育那些使用指标的人，让他们了解底层丰富数据所反映的现实。指标并不是为了展示一个囊括所有内容的完美数据集，而是从一些平凡的指标开始。DORA Metrics (由 DevOps 研究团队提出的衡量软件交付效能的四个关键指标) 对诊断非常有帮助，如果你必须汇报，它们也是向董事会、CEO 或其他高管开始报告的一个足够好的起点。然后你可能会说：“噢，这些指标存在各种问题。”\n\n(00:55:22):\n是的，确实存在各种问题，但这正是你的起点。你从这里开始引导大家，帮助他们理解其中的细微差别。这就是他们对工程管理理解变得更深刻的过程，而不是通过拒绝提供任何可衡量的指标来实现。\n\nLenny (00:55:36):\n太棒了。我很高兴这是你的回答，因为我们之前请 Nicole (Nicole Forsgren，DORA 框架的创始人之一) 上过播客，她详细介绍了 DORA 以及她推荐的所有框架。她甚至分享了一些基准数据，给人们提供参考，让他们大致了解“自己是否处于一个良好的状态”。我们会引导听众去听那一期以深入了解。太好了，很高兴你是这些指标的粉丝。\n\n(00:55:55):\n好了，在进入非常精彩的闪电问答环节之前，还有最后几个问题。其中一个是关于价值观的——公司价值观、组织价值观。对于如何思考和制定价值观，你有什么好的建议吗？对于那些试图确定组织和公司应该定义什么价值观的人，你会分享什么？有什么推荐？\n\nWill Larson (00:56:14):\n价值观确实非常有趣，对吧？不同的公司谈论价值观的方式也不同。我曾经在一家公司工作，那里的高管去参观了 Facebook (现 Meta) 的园区，看到墙上写着的价值观，就直接把 Facebook 的价值观搬过来写在我们公司的墙上。这并没有起到什么作用，反而削弱了员工对高管团队批判性思维的信心——竟然只是照搬 Facebook 墙上的东西。\n\n(00:56:39):\n但我认为那些价值观在 Facebook 确实运作良好，而且对 Facebook 很有意义。所以，你首先不能做的就是抄袭价值观，也就是所谓的“价值观货物崇拜” (Value Cargo Culting，指盲目模仿形式而不理解本质)。比如“用户至上” (Users First)，这是亚马逊非常棒的价值观。很多公司其实并没有做到用户至上，这也没关系；但如果不该做的是，你挂着“用户至上”的牌子，而实际做出的决策显然不是以用户为中心的。\n\n(00:57:06):\n所以我考虑的事情之一就是诚实。好的价值观必须是诚实的，任何价值观都可以是诚实的，但没有放之四海而皆准的诚实价值观。你可以说“我们很节俭” (Thrifty)，也可以说“为了获得最佳价值，我们愿意投入所需的一切成本”。这是完全不同的，而优秀的公司在这两种方式下都能运作。所以我经常考虑的第一条规则是“诚实”：你实际上确实做到了你在价值观中所宣称的那样。第二条是“适用性” (Applicability)：你必须拥有一个真正能指导你工作的价值观。\n\n(00:57:39):\nStripe 以前有一个价值观（我相信现在已经不是了），叫做“全局优化” (Optimize Globally)。全局优化是一个非常有趣的问题，因为有时候你想做一些对团队有利的事，比如：“嘿，我想引入一种更适合我团队的新编程语言。”但对于整个组织来说，这实际上更糟糕，所以我不会去做。\n\n(00:58:03):\nUber 虽然没有把这条写成书面价值观，但隐含的价值观是“做对你团队有利的事，忽略其他所有人，因为那会拖慢我们的速度”。这两家公司拥有截然相反的价值观，但它们都非常有适用性。它能指导我们如何做决策：我应该为我的团队优化，还是为整个组织优化？这些都能应用于现实问题。而且它们很诚实，Uber 当时就是“别担心其他人”，只要让你的团队跑通就行。这就是他们移动得如此之快的原因，因为他们根本不担心干扰。\n\nLenny (00:58:32):\n他们的价值观里不是有一条叫“踩脚” (Toe-stepping) 吗？鼓励为了进步而不怕冒犯他人。\n\nWill Larson (00:58:36):\n“让建设者去建设” (Let builders build)、“踩脚”。有很多价值观可以用不同的方式来解读，有时它们会被当作武器来使用，就像所有价值观一样。但这些价值观从不同维度来看都很有趣。所以，第一是诚实，第二是适用，第三我认为好价值观的最后一个特征是“可逆性” (Reversibility)。有些价值观实际上是无法使用的，举个例子：“我们编写优秀的软件。”好吧，难道你会选择编写差劲的软件吗？这根本说不通。或者“我们解决重要的客户问题”，很好。\n\n(00:59:22):\n哪家公司会认为自己不是在解决重要的客户问题？所以有些价值观是无法应用的。我把这些称为“身份价值观” (Identity Values)，它们只是在描述你想成为什么样的人。比如“我们关心客户”，太棒了，但谁会说自己不关心呢？我认为有些价值观只是身份价值观，拥有它们没有错，但它们并不是非常有用。\n\n(00:59:51):\n你无法用它们来做任何决定。所以我总是敦促大家不要在这些上面花太多时间，虽然当高管团队讨论这些身份价值观时感觉很好，比如“我们待人友善”，听起来不错；“我们是一家人”，听起来也不错。这一条（一家人）可能还有点可逆性。比如 Netflix 就会说：“我们是一个像职业球队那样的团队，我们不是一家人。”所以它有一点可逆性，但并不完美。\n\n(01:00:20):\n但是，是的，这三点是我发现对任何价值观都非常有用的。它诚实吗？它适用吗？它是可逆的吗？如果不是，它可能实际上并不能帮助团队做出决策。\n\nLenny (01:00:30):\n这些建议太棒了。这让我想起了……在 Airbnb 制定价值观期间我也在场。我可能会补充一点，也许这也属于你提到的某个范畴：必须明确“谁不适合”。必须有一群人是不太契合的，因为如果每个人都契合，那这个价值观就没有发挥什么实际作用。有什么意义呢？虽然说“为什么不让每个人都融入我们这个伟大的公司”听起来很奇怪，但必须明确谁不是好的选择，基本上就是谁不属于这里。这有点像邪教（Cult）的感觉，比如“谁不在我们的圈子里？谁不属于这里？”\n\nWill Larson (01:00:59):\n我同意。如果它不适用于任何人（没有排除任何情况），那为什么要费力说出来呢？它没有任何意义。你甚至可以说它实际上是招聘的过滤器——有一些人是你明确选择不雇佣的，因为价值观不适用于他们。这样我认为它就是有用的，因为它能帮你弄清楚该招谁进来。但如果它不适用于你招聘的任何人，或公司里的任何人，那就不值得保留，因为你的价值观已经太多了。你可能正试图精简价值观，因为你有 17 条，你需要减少到 4 条以便大家记住。所以如果它不适用，为什么还要保留它？\n\nLenny (01:01:32):\n是的。“正直” (Integrity) 就是一个常见的例子。每个人都有这一条，没有人会不想要正直。那你们有什么独特之处吗？\n\nWill Larson (01:01:38):\n“我们是一家不讲正直的公司。我们是一家认为正直很坏的公司。”现实中根本没有这种公司。\n\nLenny (01:01:45):\n我要补充的另一条是诚实。在 Airbnb，我们最初有六条价值观。其中一条是“简化” (Simplify)，一两年后大家意识到我们实际上并不擅长这个。我们想要简化，但我们并不具备这种能力。价值观应该描述“你是谁”，而不是“你想成为谁”或“你渴望成为谁”。所以他们砍掉了两条价值观，包括那一条。他们觉得：“我们就保留这四条吧，因为这才是真正的我们。让我们对自己诚实一点。”\n\n(01:02:11):\n好了，最后一个问题。我想聊聊“失败角落” (Failure Corner)，这是我最近在播客中增加的一个环节，让嘉宾分享一个失败的故事。你有一篇关于你在 Digg 经历的精彩博文，讲的是你们经历的那次重写，我想是 Digg 的第四个版本。你能讲讲那个故事吗？发生了什么？最后乱成什么样了？\n\nWill Larson (01:02:33):\n是的，Digg V4……我是说，我对他仍有很多美好的回忆。我保留了一张照片，照片里很多工程师围坐在巨大办公室中间的桌子旁，他们在供应寿司。那天我们请了服务员和餐饮公司。他们在分发寿司，托盘里放着香槟杯，现场还有一个完整的吧台。而我们之所以都围在那张桌子旁，是因为网站根本没上线（崩溃了）。\n\n(01:03:03):\nDigg V4 基本上是凯文·罗斯 (Kevin Rose) 或董事会，或者是两者的结合体，意识到 Digg 正在输给社交网络。如果我们不设法转向社交化，这种“新闻聚合”模式将被 Twitter、Facebook 等竞争对手击败。长期来看，甚至担心会被 Reddit 竞争下去，尽管在当时这一点还远非显而易见。所以我们需要转向支持社交功能，而之前的版本我们根本无法让它运行。\n\n(01:03:39):\n所以，在加入前大约两年半，公司就做出了重写的决定，而就在我加入大约六个月后，开始了这次转型——他们需要进行彻底的重写 (Complete Rewrite) 才能实现目标。这种决定对任何人来说几乎都没有好结果。我想作为一个更有经验的人，我本可以预见到这不会有好结果。但我当时职业生涯还很早。我在雅虎 (Yahoo) 的产品经理搭档 Das Kofinovsky 去了 Digg，他说：“来 Digg 吧。”\n\n(01:04:10):\n最坏的情况是你一年能赚几十万美元。最坏的情况。结果可能很棒。但事实并非如此。最坏的情况预测得有点乐观了。我加入前两天，CEO 被解雇了。当时的 CEO 离开了，然后 Kevin Rose 回来待了大约六个月。我们当时就像在进行一场死亡行军 (Death March，形容项目压力巨大且前景黯淡)，拼命想把这个东西发布出来。\n\n(01:04:37):\n我们拼命推进。当时大部分还没进入云 (Cloud，云服务) 时代。所以我们几乎清空了所有现有的服务器，为它们重新安装新软件的镜像 (re-image)。我们尝试让网站上线，但它一直崩溃。所以我们基本上花了一个月的时间才让它重新完全恢复功能 (fully functional)。所以，那天围坐在桌旁喝着香槟吃着寿司，其实只是第一天。到了第 30 天，大多数人甚至都不再尝试让网站恢复了。\n\n(01:05:08):\n大约只有五个人还在坚持。我们做到了。我觉得那对我来说是一个非常有力的时刻。在最初的两天里，我和另一位工程师 Rich Schumacher 必须从零开始编写一个缓存系统 (caching system)，这让我们恢复了一半的功能。顺便说一句，这真的是一种糟糕的软件开发方式。我不向任何人推荐这种做法。这是一系列东拼西凑到发布中的反模式 (anti-patterns，指表面上能解决问题但会导致更多问题的常见错误做法)。虽然部分上线了，但我们必须每 12 小时重启一次。\n\n(01:05:41):\n即使有缓存机制，每台服务器每 12 小时也必须重启一次。大约三周后，我终于找到了导致我们每 12 小时崩溃一次的核心漏洞 (bug)。这是一个极其简单但很难调试 (debug) 的问题，基本上与 Python 初始化用作默认参数 (default parameters) 的变量的方式有关。这事儿超级傻，我们当时有一个没写过 Python 的人在负责 API 代码，所以他们没意识到这是个陷阱 (gotcha)。\n\n(01:06:15):\n评审 (review) 时也没人发现，调试了很久才找到。这非常不明显。它没让程序崩溃，只是给服务器增加了大量的额外负载。我们终于搞定了，那种挺过来的经历真的很了不起。但你知道吗？公司最后还是归零 (went to zero，指倒闭) 了。我们在发布时做了这种英雄式的、超越极限的努力来维持运转。\n\n(01:06:43):\n几周后，新 CEO 上任，进行了一轮裁员。这大概是 2012 年。在我入职九个月后，团队从大约一百人减少到 30 人，从业务角度看，此后便一落千丈。但我们上线了很多功能，学到了非常多的东西。这某种程度上塑造了我对职业生涯早期的看法：去学习，哪怕进入一家日子不好过的公司。\n\n(01:07:15):\n我在职业生涯开始两年半后就成了经理。基本上负责那里的整个工程团队，因为每个有理智的人要么辞职了，要么被裁了。只有我这个彻头彻尾的笨蛋试图担任工程部门的经理。我当时不够格，没人会把那份工作交给我，但在那个时间点，我是唯一一个傻到愿意接手的人。我学到了很多，那确实是开启我整个职业生涯的核心机会，尽管当时情况非常凄惨。\n\nLenny (01:07:49):\n这是一个很棒的故事。我觉得很多这类经历在发生的当下，感觉就像“这到底是怎么回事？太糟糕太难了”，但回过头看，它们往往成了最有趣、影响最大的学习经历。你会和同事建立深厚的情谊。我总能想到苹果 (Apple) 的例子，史蒂夫·乔布斯 (Steve Jobs) 把人逼疯了，但人们回头看时会觉得那是职业生涯中最棒的时刻。\n\nWill Larson (01:08:12):\n你永远不会自愿承担这么多极具挑战的事情，但有时当它们出现时，你和一群你真心尊重、热爱合作的人在一起，想要共同克服困难。那是很强大的体验。甚至 Uber China 的经历也类似，如果有人问：“嘿，你想负责 Uber China 的迁移工作吗？”我会说：“绝对不想。”但没人问。他们只是说：“把它搞定。”于是我们就做了。我觉得这些经历都很了不起。\n\nLenny (01:08:39):\n明确一下，Digg 在那段时间里基本上瘫痪了一个月？是这样吗……\n\nWill Larson (01:08:43):\n基本上那个月的大部分时间里它都无法正常运行。只读模式在大约三天内恢复了，但绝大多数实际的用户功能在整整一个月里都无法正常使用，那体验并不好。我是说，这很不妙，但这并不是 Digg 当时面临的最大问题。不过这确实是当时最大的问题之一，而且这并不是一个预示我们会好转的迹象。但就像我说的，你能从中学习，我为我们团队能让它运转起来感到自豪，即使最终我们还是倒闭了、耗尽了资金，最后被拆分出售。\n\nLenny (01:09:32):\n你认为 Digg 本来能成功吗？是否存在一个 Digg 成为巨型成功企业的平行时空，还是说已经太晚了，或者产品不对？\n\nWill Larson (01:09:39):\n真正毁掉 Digg 的是变化。它不是 SEO (Search Engine Optimization，搜索引擎优化) 驱动的。变现是通过广告。包括 Digg 在内的许多公司都声称，它是第一家采用信息流内 (in-stream/in-feed) 广告的公司，就像 Twitter 在推文中插入广告或 Facebook 那样。Digg 在 Facebook 或 Twitter 真正创新广告格式之前就这么做了。但绝大多数的变现都来自于我们所谓的固定链接页面 (permalink pages)。那是第 40 页，也就是我们抓取的文章页，这些页面的绝大部分流量来自 Google 搜索。所以当时发生了一次 SEO 变化，这正是促使我们必须启动这次迁移的紧急原因。\n\n(01:10:20):\nSEO 规则变了，流量开始下降，变现受阻。所以当我们尝试发布这次迁移时，已经是火烧眉毛了。但我确实认为，我今天仍然想要类似 Digg 当初想做成的那种产品。社交新闻是基于我朋友们真实阅读和喜欢的，并结合了具有相似兴趣的全球用户的索引。我觉得 Google Reader 也有一些类似的组件。\n\n(01:10:49):\n这都是有趣的、解决有趣问题的产品，但出于某种原因在商业上都不成功。我确实认为那里仍然存在市场空白，但很多人尝试填补却失败了，尽管这么多人尝试，肯定有大家难以解决的深层原因。\n\nLenny (01:11:06):\n太棒了。Will，在我们进入快速提问环节之前，你还有什么想分享或留给大家的吗？因为我知道你大约五分钟后就得走了。\n\nWill Larson (01:11:16):\n我想我们已经聊了很多。我二月份要出一本新书，《工程主管入门》(Engineering Executive's Primer)，由 O'Reilly 出版社出版。大概就这些。\n\nLenny (01:11:25):\n太好了。大家在哪能找到？我知道在 O'Reilly 上，今天就能看到预览版了对吧？\n\nWill Larson (01:11:29):\n是的。O'Reilly 上可以看到早期副本。也可以在 Amazon 上订购，但要到二月才会发货。\n\nLenny (01:11:37):\n好的。明确一下，这本书是写给谁的？听起来是写给工程主管的。\n\nWill Larson (01:11:42):\n是给工程主管的，但更多是给那些想成为工程主管的人，以及那些想弄清楚如何与工程主管合作的人。所以，如果你正在苦恼为什么你的 CTO (首席技术官) 总做些蠢事，或者你想侧向管理 (side manage) 他们，或者你是产品负责人，搞不定那个整天抱怨工程师需要更有趣项目的 CTO，这本书可能对你也很有用。\n\nLenny (01:12:04):\n太棒了。准备好进入闪电提问环节 (lightning round) 了吗？\n\nWill Larson (01:12:07):\n开始吧。\n\nLenny (01:12:08):\n你向别人推荐最多的两三本书是什么？\n\nWill Larson (01:12:11):\n我提到了《系统思考》(Thinking in Systems) 及其入门读本。我也提到了《好战略，坏战略》(Good Strategy, Bad Strategy)。我再给你推荐第三本，乔治·莱考夫 (George Lakoff) 的《别想那只大象》(Don't Think of an Elephant)。这是一本关于对话中“框架效应” (framing) 的书，它真的改变了我的沟通方式。\n\nLenny (01:12:24):\n太棒了。最近有什么你喜欢的电影或电视剧吗？\n\nWill Larson (01:12:28):\n我现在不怎么看电视或电影了，但我还是会和妻子一起看《顶级大厨》(Top Chef)。她是《顶级大厨》的死忠粉。这种公式化、结构化的节目让人感到很放松，你大概知道会发生什么，没有什么严重的后果，从现实生活中逃避到这些公式化的节目里是很平静的。\n\nLenny (01:12:50):\n以前从没人提过《顶级大厨》，很有意思。你有什么最喜欢的面试问题吗？\n\nWill Larson (01:12:58):\n我现在的很多面试其实是在帮候选人决定他们是否真的想加入公司。所以我现在最喜欢问的问题是：“嘿，我们非常看好你，你会拿到录用通知。我想你也会从其他公司拿到三四个非常有吸引力的 offer (录用通知)，因为你是一个优秀的候选人。你打算如何具体地判断哪一个选项最适合你？”\n\n(01:13:22):\n我觉得这迫使人们告诉你他们真正想要什么，然后你可以告诉他们为什么你的公司比其他任何公司都能满足他们，这样你就可以针对他们真正关心的点进行游说 (pitch)，而不是在无关紧要的事情上浪费口舌。\n\nLenny (01:13:31):\n太棒了。你有什么常用的人生座右铭吗？在工作或生活中觉得很有用的？\n\nWill Larson (01:13:40):\n没什么座右铭，但我能想到两件我经常思考的事。在 Uber 时，我经常和人说，因为那是段非常艰难的时期，那就是：“别无他途，唯有穿过 (There's no way around, just through)”。意思就是：“嘿，我们不会回避这个问题。我们要咬牙挺过去，到达彼岸，然后我们就成功了。”我现在思考更多的是：“六个月后还有人会记得我们现在的决定吗？”因为我觉得人们会对很多决定感到压力巨大，但我越来越相信，大多数让人纠结的决定其实并没那么重要。\n\n(01:14:11):\n所以我会想：“六个月后还有人在意我们在这里做了什么吗？”答案通常是否定的。只要做一个合理的决定，然后继续处理下一个更重要的事情。\n\nLenny (01:14:17):\n太棒了。你写过很多文章。有没有哪篇是你觉得被低估了，或者大家没真正看懂、没流传开来，但你觉得“啊，我为此感到非常自豪”的？\n\nWill Larson (01:14:30):\n去年我最自豪的一篇可能是《难以共事》(Hard To Work With)。这篇文章基本上是关于，我看到很多才华横溢的人，他们试图让同事保持高标准，结果却被视为好斗或难以共事。这源于我职业生涯早期的核心挣扎，我当时一直尝试去提高标准，我以为我是在要求大家负责，但人们却觉得：“和你一起工作简直太差劲了。”\n\n(01:14:58):\n我当时心想：“但我只是想保持高标准（High standard）。这难道不是我们想要的吗？”谈到诚实的价值观，每家公司都会说：“我们拥有高标准。”然后你会说：“好啊，那我们就付诸行动。”接着他们却表现得像：“我们这儿其实没什么高标准，你这人真差劲。”所以，那个理念对我来说真的非常有变革意义（Transformational），而且我认为它确实让一些人深受感触，因为我觉得很多人在整个职业生涯中都没能弄明白这一点。\n\n(01:15:20):\n他们是你共事过的人中最有才华、最努力的一群人，却始终无法领会这个阻碍他们前进的核心理念。他们非常在意工作，但也往往因为太在意而招人反感。我希望随着时间的推移，能有更多人读到这篇文章，因为这其中包含了一个对我来说非常重要的教训。\n\nLenny (01:15:42):\n好的，我们会在节目笔记（Show notes，播客节目的详细介绍和资源链接）中附上链接，帮助更多人发现它。最后两个问题：如果大家想要联系你或进一步咨询问题，可以在哪里找到你？以及，听众可以为你提供什么帮助吗？\n\nWill Larson (01:15:51):\n可以在网上通过 lethain.com 找到我，lethain.com。我所有的文章、书籍以及所有链接都在那里。我目前思考最多的是战略（Strategy）。所以我对那些正在思考战略，或者认为自己在产品、业务或工程战略（Engineering strategy）方面做得很好的人非常好奇。我很想听听大家的想法，哪些方法是真正奏效的，以及在职业生涯早期曾以为有效、但后来发现其实行不通的那些误区（Lies）。\n\nLenny (01:16:19):\n太棒了。Will，非常感谢你能来到这里。\n\nWill Larson (01:16:23):\n非常感谢，这次对话真的很愉快。\n\nLenny (01:16:25):\n我也是。各位再见，非常感谢大家的收听。如果你觉得本期节目有价值，可以在 Apple Podcasts、Spotify
